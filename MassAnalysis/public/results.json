I remember the deeds of the\n(519.38, 528.42)  Lord. I remember the deeds of the Lord, yes I remember your wonders of old, and I\n(528.42, 537.9)  meditate on your works, your exploits I ponder. Oh God, your way is holy.\n(537.9, 543.82)  What great God is there like our God? You are the God who works wonders among\n(543.82, 548.26)  peoples. You have made known your power.\n(549.38, 555.38)  With your strong arm you redeemed your people. The sons of Jacob and Joseph, you\n(555.38, 561.26)  led your people like a flock under the care of Moses and Aaron.\n(567.9, 586.82)  The Lord be with you.\n(586.82, 593.96)  A reading from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew.\n(593.96, 596.96)  Jesus said to his disciples,\n(596.96, 601.08)  Whoever wishes to come after me must deny himself,\n(601.08, 604.2)  take up his cross and follow me.\n(604.2, 608.22)  For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it,\n(608.22, 611.92)  but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.\n(613.16, 617.6)  What profit would there be for one to gain the whole world\n(617.6, 619.44)  and forfeit his life?\n(620.32, 624.38)  Or what can one give in exchange for his life?\n(624.38, 627.02)  For the Son of Man will come with his angels\n(627.02, 632.02)  in his Father's glory, and then he will repay each\n(632.02, 634.78)  according to his conduct.\n(634.78, 636.8)  Amen, I say to you.\n(636.8, 640.38)  There are some standing here who will not taste death\n(640.38, 644.78)  until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.\n(644.78, 647.1)  The Gospel of the Lord.\n(647.1, 649.34)  Praise to you, Lord Jesus.\n(652.76, 649.34) \n(658.18, 668.26)  Today, as we celebrate the Feast of Saint Dominic, we're reminded through the Gospel of the radical call of discipleship to deny ourselves, take up our cross, and follow Christ.\n(668.26, 677.02)  This call is really a path of life marked by surrender and sacrifice and deep trust\n(677.02, 679.86)  in God's mission.\n(679.86, 683.66)  Saint Dominic answered this call with his whole being.\n(683.66, 690.66)  He lived poverty, he pursued truth in the church, and preached the gospel with really\n(690.66, 699.76)  a burning zeal, especially in a time when confusion threatened the faith of many.\n(699.76, 707.1)  He did not seek his own comfort or success, but the salvation of souls.\n(707.1, 712.56)  And his life really echoes Jesus' words today in the Gospel.\n(712.56, 719.68)  What will it profit a man if he gains the whole world, but forfeits his life, forfeits\n(719.68, 723.08)  his soul really?\n(723.08, 730.28)  Dominic chose the soul, his own, and those of countless others that he helped to understand\n(730.28, 734.38)  that message of Christ, and his preaching especially.\n(734.38, 740.88)  He gave up wealth, reputation, and safety to walk the narrow road with Christ, and because\n(740.88, 743.04)  of that he became a beacon of life.\n(743.04, 750.22)  He founded the order of preachers, the Dominicans, who of course continued to carry the Lord's\n(750.22, 757.58)  message and mercy into the world today. So as we honor this great saint, Saint\n(757.58, 764.02)  Dominic, let us ask the Lord today for ourselves what cross is Christ inviting\n(764.02, 772.58)  me to carry? How can I deny myself in love for God and neighbor? And like Saint\n(772.58, 778.3)  Dominic, may we preach not just with words but with our lives joyfully,\n(778.3, 790.64)  humbly following Christ where he leads us. Let us pray and we come to the Lord\n(790.64, 795.1)  with our prayers this morning trusting that he knows our needs and we pray for\n(795.1, 800.4)  the church. May the Lord bless her mission to proclaim the gospel for the\n(800.4, 808.32)  salvation of souls we pray to the Lord for world leaders may the Holy Spirit\n(808.32, 817.56)  inspire them to seek peace we pray to the Lord for all who struggle to forgive\n(817.56, 826.08)  may God heal and soften their hearts with his grace we pray to the Lord for\n(826.08, 831.4)  For all of us gathered here, may we learn to love one another as Christ loves us.\n(831.4, 835.36)  We pray to the Lord.\n(835.36, 840.98)  For all the sick, those in hospital or nursing home, those undergoing surgery or treatment,\n(840.98, 847.8)  that God's healing presence may be with them, we pray to the Lord.\n(847.8, 853.04)  For all who have died in faith, and today we remember Peter Daniels for whom this Mass\n(853.04, 860.48)  is offered. May the Father welcome them into his kingdom. We pray to the Lord.\n(860.48, 865.8)  Heavenly Father, receive our petitions and grant them in your mercy. We ask this\n(865.8, 869.56)  through Christ our Lord.\n(883.04, 904.94)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through your goodness we have received\n(904.94, 909.1)  the bread we offer you, fruit of the earth and work of human hands.\n(909.1, 914.18)  It will become for us the bread of life.\n(914.18, 918.7)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through your goodness we have received\n(918.7, 922.78)  the wine we offer you, fruit of the vine and work of human hands.\n(922.78, 925.18)  will become our spiritual drink.\n(940.46, 941.98)  Pray, brothers and sisters,\n(941.98, 945.26)  that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable\n(945.26, 947.42)  to God the almighty Father.\n(951.02, 947.42) \n(961.42, 966.42)  and the glory of St. Joseph Christ our God and the lawless of the Church. Attend mercifully to the prayers we offer you O Lord by the intercession of\n(966.42, 971.34)  Saint Dominic and through the great power of this sacrifice strengthened by\n(971.34, 977.14)  the protection of your grace those who champion the faith through Christ our\n(977.14, 986.5)  our Lord. The Lord be with you. Lift up your hearts. Let us give thanks to the Lord our\n(986.5, 994.2)  God. It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, always and everywhere to\n(994.2, 1001.34)  give you thanks, Lord Holy Father, almighty and eternal God, through Christ our Lord.\n(1001.34, 1007.12)  For on the festival of Saint Dominic you bid your church rejoice, so too you strengthen\n(1007.12, 1013.92)  her by the example of his holy life, teach her by his words of preaching, and keep her\n(1013.92, 1017.04)  safe in answer to his prayers.\n(1017.04, 1021.96)  And so with the company of angels and saints we sing the hymn of your praise, as without\n(1021.96, 1024.84)  end we now acclaim.\n(1024.84, 1032.66)  Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts, heaven and earth are full of your glory, Hosanna\n(1032.66, 1034.6)  in the highest.\n(1034.6, 1042.38)  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, Hosanna in the highest.\n(1042.38, 1046.06)  You are indeed holy, O Lord, the fount of all holiness.\n(1046.06, 1051.54)  Make holy, therefore, these gifts, we pray, by sending down your Spirit upon them like\n(1051.54, 1059.22)  the dewfall so that they may become for us the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.\n(1059.22, 1065.38)  At the time he was betrayed and entered willingly into his passion, he took bread and giving\n(1065.38, 1072.42)  thanks broke it and gave it to his disciples saying, Take this all of you and eat of it,\n(1072.42, 1084.72)  For this is my body, which will be given up for you.\n(1084.72, 1090.0)  In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took the chalice, and once more giving thanks,\n(1090.0, 1095.5)  he gave it to his disciples, saying, Take this, all of you, and drink from it.\n(1095.5, 1100.66)  For this is the chalice of my blood, the blood of the new and eternal covenant, which will\n(1100.66, 1107.14)  be poured out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Do this in memory of me.\n(1116.82, 1124.34)  The mystery of faith. When we eat this bread and drink this cup, we proclaim your death, O Lord,\n(1124.9, 1124.34) \n(1130.04, 1135.16)  until you come again. Therefore as we celebrate the memorial of his death and resurrection we offer you Lord the bread of life and the chalice of salvation.\n(1135.16, 1139.8)  Giving thanks that you have held us worthy to be in your presence and\n(1139.8, 1144.62)  minister to you. Humbly we pray that partaking of the body and blood of\n(1144.62, 1150.76)  Christ we may be gathered into one by the Holy Spirit. Remember Lord your\n(1150.76, 1154.9)  church spread throughout the world and bring her to the fullness of charity\n(1154.9, 1161.44)  together with Leo our Pope and Richard our Bishop and all the clergy. Remember\n(1161.44, 1166.26)  also our brothers and sisters who have fallen asleep in the hope of the\n(1166.26, 1172.02)  resurrection and all who have died in your mercy. Welcome them into the light\n(1172.02, 1177.66)  of your face. Have mercy on us all we pray that with the Blessed Virgin Mary\n(1177.66, 1182.76)  Mary, Mother of God, Saint Joseph, her spouse, with the Blessed Apostles, Saint\n(1182.76, 1187.5)  Bridget, Saint Augustine, Saint Dominic, and all the saints who have pleased you\n(1187.5, 1193.14)  throughout the ages, that we may merit to be co-heirs to eternal life and may\n(1193.14, 1199.62)  praise and glorify you through your Son, Jesus Christ. Through him and with him\n(1199.62, 1205.22)  and in him, O God Almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, all glory and\n(1205.22, 1215.14)  honor is yours forever and ever at the Savior's command informed by divine\n(1215.14, 1221.14)  teaching we dare to pray now our Father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name\n(1221.14, 1228.1)  thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven give us this\n(1228.1, 1234.14)  day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who\n(1234.14, 1240.5)  trespass against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil.\n(1240.5, 1247.02)  Deliver us Lord we pray from every evil graciously grant peace in our days that\n(1247.02, 1252.34)  by the help of your mercy we may be always free from sin and safe from all\n(1252.34, 1257.1)  distress as we await the blessed hope and the coming of our Savior Jesus\n(1257.1, 1266.74)  Christ Lord Jesus Christ who said to your apostles peace I leave you my peace\n(1266.74, 1271.26)  I give you look not now on our sins but on the faith of your church and\n(1271.26, 1276.38)  graciously grant your peace and unity in accordance with your will who live and\n(1276.38, 1283.5)  reign forever and ever the peace of the Lord be with you always let's offer each\n(1283.5, 1287.46)  other some sign of Christ's peace.\n(1294.02, 1301.42)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.

I confess to Almighty God and to you my brothers\n(278.56, 284.08)  and sisters that I have gravely sinned in my thoughts and in my words and what\n(284.08, 288.76)  I have done and what I have failed to do through my fault, through my fault,\n(288.76, 293.38)  through my most grievous fault. Therefore I ask the Blessed Mary of her\n(293.38, 299.86)  Virgin, all the angels and saints, and you, my brothers and sisters, to pray for me to the Lord\n(299.86, 305.38)  our God. May almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us our sins, and bring us to everlasting life.\n(306.34, 314.74)  Lord have mercy. Christ have mercy. Lord have mercy. Let us pray.\n(317.46, 314.74) \n(323.48, 328.32)  May Saint Dominic come to the help of your church by his merits and teaching, O Lord. And may he, who was an outstanding preacher of your truth, be a devoted intercessor on\n(328.32, 329.32)  our behalf.\n(329.32, 333.96)  You are our Lord Jesus Christ, your son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of\n(333.96, 342.48)  the Holy Spirit, God forever and ever.\n(342.48, 356.8)  A reading from the book of Deuteronomy.\n(356.8, 364.96)  Moses said to the people, ask now of the days of old before your time.\n(364.96, 370.24)  Ever since God created man upon the earth.\n(370.24, 374.52)  from one end of the sky to the other.\n(374.52, 378.92)  Did anything so great ever happen before?\n(378.92, 381.24)  Was it ever heard of?\n(381.24, 390.92)  Did a people ever hear the voice of God speaking from the midst of fire, as you did and live?\n(390.92, 399.64)  Or did any God venture to go take a nation for himself from the midst of another nation\n(399.64, 408.76)  by testings, by signs and wonders, by war, with his strong hand and outstretched arm,\n(408.76, 417.68)  and by great terrors, all of which the Lord your God did for you in Egypt before your\n(417.68, 419.96)  very eyes.\n(419.96, 428.58)  All this you were allowed to see, that you might know the Lord is God, and there is no\n(428.58, 435.58)  no other. Out of the heavens he let you hear his voice to discipline you. On earth he let\n(438.66, 445.66)  you see his great fire, and you heard him speaking out of the fire. For love of your\n(447.66, 454.66)  fathers, he chose their descendants and personally led you out of Egypt by his great power, driving\n(458.42, 454.66) \n(464.98, 474.46)  by His great power, driving out of your way nations greater and mightier than you, so as to bring you in and to make their land your heritage as it is today.\n(474.46, 481.9)  This is why you must now know and fix in your heart that the Lord is God in the heavens\n(481.9, 488.98)  above and on the earth below, and that there is no other.\n(488.98, 496.78)  You must keep his statutes and commandments, which I enjoin on you today, that you and\n(496.78, 503.88)  your children after you may prosper, and that you may have a long life on the land which\n(503.88, 509.66)  the Lord your God is giving you forever.\"\n(509.66, 515.64)  Word of the Lord.\n(515.64, 523.18)  I remember the deeds of the Lord, I remember the deeds of the Lord, I remember the deeds\n(523.18, 532.02)  of the Lord, yes, I remember your wonders of old, and I meditate on your works, your\n(532.02, 537.94)  exploits I ponder, I remember the deeds of the Lord.\n(537.94, 541.42)  O God, your way is holy.\n(541.42, 545.5)  What great God is there like our God?\n(545.5, 552.38)  You are the God who works wonders among the peoples you have made known your power.\n(552.38, 556.74)  I remember the deeds of the Lord.\n(556.74, 564.38)  With your strong arm you redeemed your people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph.\n(564.38, 571.42)  You led your people like a flock under the care of Moses and Aaron.\n(571.42, 573.98)  Amen of the deeds of the Lord.\n(589.98, 592.3)  The Lord be with you.\n(592.3, 595.02)  a reading from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew.\n(597.58, 599.94)  Jesus said to his disciples,\n(599.94, 603.4)  whoever wishes to come after me must deny himself,\n(603.4, 606.22)  take up his cross and follow me.\n(606.22, 609.5)  For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it,\n(609.5, 613.86)  but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.\n(613.86, 617.02)  What profit would there be for one to gain the whole world\n(617.02, 619.08)  and forfeit his life?\n(619.08, 622.1)  Or what can one give in exchange for his life?\n(622.1, 624.18)  For the Son of Man will come with his angels\n(624.18, 625.78)  in his Father's glory,\n(625.78, 629.34)  and then he will repay each according to his conduct.\n(629.34, 630.84)  Amen, I say to you.\n(630.84, 633.94)  There are some standing here who will not taste death\n(633.94, 637.1)  until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.\n(637.1, 638.6)  The gospel of the Lord.\n(642.98, 645.7)  We've all had the experience of sitting down\n(645.7, 647.7)  to try to pray and not really knowing\n(647.7, 649.98)  where to begin or what to say.\n(649.98, 652.18)  And our first reading in our Psalm today\n(652.18, 654.66)  give us a great clue on how we can begin\n(654.66, 656.98)  to deepen our own prayer life.\n(656.98, 658.9)  And that is by recalling,\n(658.9, 661.08)  as the words of the Responsorial Psalm says,\n(661.08, 663.02)  the deeds of the Lord.\n(663.02, 666.26)  The whole first reading is Moses reminding\n(666.26, 669.26)  the people of Israel of all the blessings\n(669.26, 672.06)  that God has bestowed on their life.\n(672.06, 674.38)  When we sit down to pray,\n(674.38, 676.98)  we would do well to call to mind\n(676.98, 680.34)  all of the blessings God has bestowed on us\n(680.34, 682.64)  because he's a good father who provides\n(682.64, 684.26)  for all of our needs.\n(684.26, 688.42)  This is so important because the fundamental sin of Israel\n(688.42, 693.42)  and for us as well is that they forget that God is good.\n(693.9, 696.78)  And so therefore they wanna become self-reliant\n(696.78, 699.22)  and they wanna take matters into their own hands\n(699.22, 703.02)  and we do this all the time, especially when we're in trial.\n(703.02, 705.46)  And so that's why it's a great practice\n(705.46, 709.22)  when we pray to spend a few minutes every day\n(709.22, 712.5)  thanking God and remembering all the deeds\n(712.5, 714.18)  that he's done for us.\n(714.18, 717.14)  In fact, this is the job of the preacher,\n(717.14, 721.22)  is to remind his people that the Lord is good.\n(721.22, 724.18)  The priest we celebrate today, the feast of Saint Dominic,\n(724.18, 725.74)  the founder of the Dominican order,\n(725.74, 727.66)  which is the order of preachers,\n(727.66, 732.22)  he felt called by God in the early 1200s\n(732.22, 735.84)  to correct an error that was circulating around\n(735.84, 739.24)  in the church that the Lord wasn't good,\n(739.24, 742.52)  that he only wanted to save a select few.\n(742.52, 746.0)  And so Saint Dominic dedicated his whole life\n(746.0, 748.68)  to preaching this truth.\n(748.68, 750.2)  And how did he do it?\n(750.2, 754.88)  First, he reminded his people and all of his followers\n(754.88, 758.82)  that studying the doctrines of the faith is very important.\n(758.82, 761.8)  We can't live a fruitful spiritual life\n(761.8, 764.9)  if we don't know what the church teaches.\n(764.9, 767.52)  And so within appropriate means for our state of life\n(767.52, 769.46)  and our age and our intellect,\n(769.46, 773.96)  we should have a desire to learn more about the faith\n(773.96, 777.12)  because we can't love what we don't know.\n(777.12, 779.96)  And this was a foundational principle for St. Dominic\n(779.96, 781.08)  in the order of preachers.\n(781.08, 783.6)  And then last but not least,\n(783.6, 787.54)  he went everywhere preaching the rosary\n(787.54, 790.8)  because the rosary brings us to Jesus.\n(790.8, 794.52)  And so what a lesson it is that to correct an error\n(794.52, 798.12)  about Christ, the remedy was to go to Mary.\n(798.12, 801.64)  And so in our lives, we would do well when we pray\n(801.64, 804.28)  to call to mind the goodness of God,\n(804.28, 808.28)  and that will lead to a desire to study his saving truths\n(808.28, 811.46)  and to cling to Mary who always brings us to her son.\n(811.46, 814.56)  And so let us stand and ask God for this grace\n(814.56, 815.86)  through our prayers.\n(818.16, 815.86) \n(823.36, 828.86)  We pray for Pope Leo and for Bishop Richard Henning and for all bishops throughout the church. May God give them the grace to be true shepherds of souls after the heart of St. Dominic.\n(828.86, 829.86)  We pray to the Lord.\n(829.86, 835.36)  We pray for all civil leaders, governments, and elected officials throughout the world.\n(835.36, 839.86)  May they enact policies that protect the church and give her the freedom to be herself\n(839.86, 842.86)  so the kingdom of God can be spread to every corner of the globe.\n(842.86, 843.86)  We pray to the Lord.\n(843.86, 852.86)  We pray for an increase of vocations to the priesthood and to the religious life, especially for members from our own parishes and our own families.\n(852.86, 859.86)  May God call many men and women to give their lives entirely to God to remind His people of His goodness and faithfulness.\n(859.86, 862.86)  We pray to the Lord.\n(862.86, 867.86)  And we pray for our parishioners for whom this Mass is offered. We pray to the Lord.\n(867.86, 871.64)  Heavenly Father, we make these prayers with great confidence\n(871.64, 874.28)  as we ask them through the intercession of Saint Dominic\n(874.28, 876.8)  and Mary, our morning star and gate of heaven,\n(876.8, 879.24)  and we speak them in the name of Jesus, her son,\n(879.24, 881.16)  who is Lord forever and ever.\n(927.86, 934.86)  All right, we're going to take a short break, and we're going to take a short break.\n(957.86, 974.64)  Pray, brothers and sisters, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God, the Almighty\n(974.64, 984.14)  Father.\n(984.14, 989.7)  And mercifully to the prayers we offer you, O Lord, by the intercession of St. Dominic,\n(989.7, 994.92)  and through the great power of this sacrifice, strengthened by the protection of your grace,\n(994.92, 999.78)  those who champion the faith, through Christ our Lord.\n(999.78, 1002.14)  The Lord be with you.\n(1002.14, 1004.74)  Lift up your hearts.\n(1004.74, 1008.34)  Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.\n(1008.34, 1012.74)  It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, always and everywhere to give you\n(1012.74, 1013.74)  thanks.\n(1013.74, 1015.98)  Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God,\n(1015.98, 1017.66)  through Christ our Lord.\n(1017.66, 1019.62)  For as on the festival of Saint Dominic,\n(1019.62, 1021.5)  you bid your church rejoice,\n(1021.5, 1024.98)  so too you strengthen her by the example of his holy life,\n(1024.98, 1027.14)  teach her by his words of preaching,\n(1027.14, 1029.76)  and keep her safe in answer to his prayers.\n(1029.76, 1032.3)  And so with the company of angels and saints,\n(1032.3, 1034.12)  we sing the hymn of your praise,\n(1034.12, 1036.42)  as without end we acclaim.\n(1036.42, 1040.46)  Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts,\n(1040.46, 1042.98)  heaven and earth are full of your glory,\n(1042.98, 1044.9)  Ozana in the highest.\n(1044.9, 1048.06)  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.\n(1048.06, 1049.86)  Ozana in the highest.\n(1051.56, 1053.46)  You are indeed holy, oh Lord,\n(1053.46, 1056.26)  and all you have created rightly gives you praise.\n(1056.26, 1058.9)  For through your son, our Lord Jesus Christ,\n(1058.9, 1061.42)  by the power and working of the Holy Spirit,\n(1061.42, 1064.14)  you give life to all things and make them holy,\n(1064.14, 1067.02)  and you never cease to gather a people to yourself\n(1067.02, 1069.7)  so that from the rising of the sun to its setting,\n(1069.7, 1073.1)  a pure sacrifice may be offered to your name.\n(1073.1, 1075.82)  Therefore, O Lord, we humbly implore you,\n(1075.82, 1078.64)  by the same Spirit graciously make holy these gifts\n(1078.64, 1080.82)  we have brought to you for consecration,\n(1080.82, 1083.54)  that they may become the body and blood\n(1083.54, 1086.34)  of your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ,\n(1086.34, 1089.46)  at whose command we celebrate these mysteries.\n(1089.46, 1092.06)  For on the night he was betrayed,\n(1092.06, 1095.1)  he himself took breath, and giving you thanks,\n(1095.1, 1097.74)  he said the blessing, broke the breath,\n(1097.74, 1101.4)  and gave it to his disciples, saying,\n(1101.4, 1105.86)  take this, all of you, and eat of it,\n(1105.86, 1110.86)  for this is my body, which will be given up for you.\n(1114.04, 1119.04)  In a similar way, when supper was ended,\n(1127.74, 1134.38)  he took the chalice and giving you thanks he said the blessing and gave the chalice to his disciples\n(1134.38, 1144.46)  saying take this all of you and drink from it for this is the chalice of my blood the blood of the\n(1144.46, 1150.3)  new and eternal covenant which will be poured out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins\n(1151.26, 1150.3) \n(1169.62, 1171.62)  Do this in memory of me. The mystery of faith.\n(1171.62, 1177.1)  Save us, savior of the world, for by your cross and resurrection, recognizing the sacrificial\n(1177.1, 1181.56)  victim by whose death you will to reconcile us to yourself. Granted we who\n(1181.56, 1185.64)  are nourished by the body and blood of your son and filled with his Holy Spirit\n(1185.64, 1190.52)  may become one body one spirit in Christ. May he make of us an eternal offering to\n(1190.52, 1194.74)  you so that we may obtain an inheritance with your elect especially with the most\n(1194.74, 1199.4)  blessed Virgin Mary mother of God with blessed Joseph her spouse with your\n(1199.4, 1203.58)  blessed apostles and glorious martyrs with Saint Dominic and with all the\n(1203.58, 1208.42)  Saints, under constant intercession in your presence, we rely for unfailing help.\n(1208.42, 1213.62)  May this sacrifice of our reconciliation, we pray, O Lord, advance the peace and\n(1213.62, 1217.54)  salvation of all the world. Be pleased to confirm in faith and charity your\n(1217.54, 1221.74)  pilgrim church on earth with your servant Leo, our Pope, and Richard, our\n(1221.74, 1225.9)  bishop, the order of bishops, all the clergy, and the entire people you have\n(1225.9, 1231.26)  gained for your own. Listen graciously to the prayers of this family, whom you have\n(1231.26, 1235.98)  summon before you in your compassion oh merciful father gather to yourself all\n(1235.98, 1239.66)  your children scattered throughout the world to our departed brothers and\n(1239.66, 1243.1)  sisters and to all who are pleasing to you at their passing from this light\n(1243.1, 1247.38)  give kind admittance to your kingdom there we hope to enjoy forever the\n(1247.38, 1251.3)  fullness of your glory through Christ our Lord through whom you bestow on the\n(1251.3, 1261.02)  world all that is good through him and with him and in him Oh God Almighty\n(1261.02, 1266.66)  Father in the unity of the Holy Spirit all glory and honor is yours forever\n(1266.66, 1274.26)  and ever at the Savior's command informed by divine teaching we dare to\n(1274.26, 1280.46)  say our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come\n(1280.46, 1286.4)  thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread\n(1286.4, 1292.1)  and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us\n(1292.1, 1298.16)  and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil deliver us Lord we\n(1298.16, 1302.56)  pray from every evil graciously grant peace in our days that by the help of\n(1302.56, 1307.16)  your mercy we may be always free from sin and safe from all distress as we\n(1307.16, 1316.2)  await the blessed hope and the coming of our Savior Jesus Christ. Lord Jesus\n(1316.2, 1320.56)  Christ who said to your apostles peace I leave you my peace I give you look not\n(1320.56, 1324.28)  in our sins but on the faith of your church and graciously grant her peace\n(1324.28, 1328.76)  and unity in accordance with your will who live and reign forever and ever the\n(1328.76, 1335.16)  peace of the Lord be with you always let us offer each other the sign of peace\n(1337.16, 1342.22)  Lamb of God you take away the sins of the world have mercy on us\n(1342.68, 1347.36)  Lamb of God you take away the sins of the world have mercy on us\n(1347.8, 1351.96)  Lamb of God you take away the sins of the world grant us peace\n(1367.16, 1373.56)  Behold the Lamb of God, behold him who takes away the sins of the world, blessed\n(1373.56, 1378.22)  are those called to the supper of the Lamb. Lord, I am not worthy that you\n(1378.22, 1385.0)  should enter under my roof, but only say the word and my soul shall be healed.\n(1426.16, 1431.2)  the steward, faithful and prudent, whom the Lord set over his household,\n(1431.2, 1435.2)  to give them their allowance of food at the proper time.\n(1606.16, 1631.56)  Let us pray.\n(1631.56, 1642.24)  May your church, O Lord, receive with wholehearted reverence the power of this heavenly sacrament,\n(1642.24, 1648.6)  by which we have been nourished on the commemoration of Saint Dominic, and may your church, having\n(1648.6, 1654.2)  flourished by means of his preaching, be helped through his intercession, through Christ our\n(1654.2, 1655.64)  Lord.\n(1655.64, 1657.72)  The Lord be with you.\n(1657.72, 1663.12)  May almighty God bless you, the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit.\n(1663.12, 1671.2)  Go forth, the Mass has ended.\n",

        "transcript": "(240.0, 269.0)  How beautiful you are over a day like this.\n(269.0, 273.78)  you are, O Virgin of Christ, who are worthy to receive the Lord's crown, the\n(273.78, 277.64)  crown of perpetual virginity. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the\n(277.64, 283.28)  Holy Spirit. Amen. The Lord be with you. Today's Mass is offered for our\n(283.28, 287.72)  parishioners and we celebrate the feast of St. Clair of Assisi. My brothers and\n(287.72, 291.62)  sisters, let us acknowledge our sins and so prepare ourselves to celebrate the\n(291.62, 298.4)  sacred mysteries. I confess to Almighty God and to you my brothers and sisters\n(298.4, 304.04)  that I have greatly sinned in my thoughts and in my words and what I have\n(304.04, 308.32)  done and what I have failed to do through my fault through my fault\n(308.32, 313.64)  through my most grievous fault. Therefore I ask the Blessed Mary of a virgin all\n(313.64, 318.36)  the angels and saints and you my brothers and sisters to pray for me to\n(318.36, 322.86)  the Lord our God. May Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us our sins, and\n(322.86, 332.52)  bring us to everlasting life. Lord have mercy. Christ have mercy. Lord have mercy.\n(332.52, 340.98)  Let us pray. Oh God, who in your mercy led St. Clair to a love of poverty, grant\n(340.98, 346.06)  through her intercession that following Christ in poverty of spirit we may merit\n(346.06, 350.42)  contemplate you one day in the heavenly kingdom through our Lord Jesus Christ\n(350.42, 354.94)  your son who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit God\n(354.94, 358.14)  forever and ever.\n(374.3, 358.14) \n(378.82, 380.82)  A reading from the book of Deuteronomy.\n(380.82, 381.82)  Moses said to the people,\n(381.82, 382.82)  and now Israel,\n(382.82, 383.82)  what does the Lord your God\n(383.82, 384.82)  ask of you,\n(384.82, 385.82)  but to fear the Lord your God\n(385.82, 387.58)  and follow his ways exactly,\n(387.58, 392.78)  To love and serve the Lord your God with all your heart and all your soul, to keep the\n(392.78, 400.36)  commandments and statutes of the Lord, which I enjoy you today for all of your good.\n(400.36, 405.0)  Think the heavens, even the highest heavens, belong to the Lord your God, as well as the\n(405.0, 407.2)  earth and everything on it.\n(407.2, 413.48)  Yet in his love for your fathers, the Lord so attached to them as he chose you, their\n(413.48, 418.48)  in preference to all other people, as indeed he has done now.\n(418.48, 422.48)  Circumcise your hearts, therefore, and be no longer stiff-necked.\n(422.48, 425.48)  The Lord your God is the God of gods,\n(425.48, 429.48)  the Lord of lords, the great God, mighty and awesome,\n(429.48, 432.48)  who has no favors, except no bribes,\n(432.48, 435.48)  who executes justice for the orphan and the widow,\n(435.48, 439.48)  and befriends the alien, feeding and clothing him.\n(439.48, 442.48)  So you too must befriend the alien,\n(442.48, 446.16)  for you were once aliens yourselves in the land of Egypt.\n(446.16, 450.32)  The Lord your God shall you fear and him shall you serve.\n(450.32, 457.04)  Hold fast to him and swear by his name. He is your glory, he your God who has\n(457.04, 459.68)  done for you those great and terrible things\n(459.68, 463.6)  which your own eyes have seen. Your ancestors\n(463.6, 468.08)  went down to Egypt 70 strong and now the Lord your God\n(468.08, 471.6)  has made you as numerous as the stars in the sky.\n(471.6, 475.6)  The word of the Lord.\n(475.66, 477.24)  Responsorial Psalm.\n(477.3, 479.34)  Praise the Lord, Jerusalem.\n(479.4, 481.4)  Praise the Lord, Jerusalem.\n(481.48, 484.44)  Glorify the Lord, O Jerusalem.\n(484.5, 486.38)  Raise your God, O Zion,\n(486.44, 489.08)  for he has strengthened the bars of your gates.\n(489.14, 492.12)  He has blessed your children within you.\n(492.18, 494.66)  Praise to the Lord, Jerusalem.\n(494.72, 497.26)  He has granted peace in your borders\n(497.32, 500.12)  with the best of wheat he fills you.\n(500.2, 500.12) \n(503.08, 505.44)  He sends forth his command to the earth, swiftly runs his word.\n(505.44, 507.72)  Praise to the Lord at Jerusalem.\n(507.72, 510.16)  He has proclaimed his word to Jacob,\n(510.16, 513.64)  his statues and his ordinances to Israel.\n(513.64, 516.74)  He has not done this for any other nation.\n(516.74, 520.0)  His ordinance he has not made known to them.\n(520.0, 521.56)  Hallelujah.\n(521.56, 523.52)  Praise to the Lord at Jerusalem.\n(530.12, 546.32)  the Lord be with you a reading from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew as Jesus\n(546.32, 550.74)  and his disciples were gathering in Galilee Jesus said to them the Son of\n(550.74, 554.98)  Man is to be handed over to men and they will kill him and he will be raised on\n(554.98, 559.64)  the third day and they were overwhelmed with grief when they came to Capernaum\n(559.64, 563.56)  the collectors of the temple tax approached Peter and said,\n(563.56, 566.08)  does not your teacher pay the temple tax?\n(566.08, 567.84)  Yes, he said.\n(567.84, 570.84)  When he came into the house before he had time to speak,\n(570.84, 574.14)  Jesus asked him, what is your opinion, Simon?\n(574.14, 576.3)  From whom do the kings of the earth take tolls\n(576.3, 580.6)  or census tax, from their subjects or from foreigners?\n(580.6, 583.36)  When he said from foreigners, Jesus said to him,\n(583.36, 585.68)  then the subjects are exempt,\n(585.68, 588.24)  but that we may not offend them, go to the sea,\n(588.24, 591.88)  drop in a hook and take the first fish that comes up.\n(591.88, 593.96)  Open its mouth and you will find a coin\n(593.96, 596.28)  worth twice the temple tax.\n(596.28, 599.08)  Give that to them for me and for you.\n(599.08, 600.5)  The gospel of the Lord.\n(606.52, 608.8)  One of the signs that there's a crisis\n(608.8, 611.28)  of sanctity or holiness in our day and age\n(611.28, 613.36)  is whenever the question comes up,\n(613.36, 617.0)  what do we have to do to draw more people to the church?\n(617.0, 620.74)  Sometimes we immediately jump to changing\n(620.74, 622.26)  or thinking it would be a good idea\n(622.26, 625.86)  to change foundational structures in the church.\n(625.86, 627.66)  And if we read about the saints,\n(627.66, 630.6)  we see whenever there was a need for reform in the church,\n(630.6, 632.74)  which there is in every age,\n(632.74, 636.3)  the answer isn't what should we change about the church,\n(636.3, 639.3)  but what should we change about ourselves?\n(639.3, 642.5)  How do we, as the first reading says,\n(642.5, 649.78)  circumcise our hearts and give our hearts over to God. The saint we celebrate today Saint Claire\n(649.78, 655.54)  of Assisi is a perfect example of this. Saint Claire who lived in the middle ages was the first\n(655.54, 662.74)  woman to ever write a rule of religious life and she had lots of wealth and she was from a very\n(662.74, 671.46)  influential family but she was so drawn to live for Christ in a radical poverty and humility and\n(671.46, 674.42)  And so she renounced all of that\n(674.42, 679.18)  and began this great quest to live completely for the Lord.\n(679.18, 682.34)  And it's a great reminder for us that\n(682.34, 686.58)  when we commit to God and we respond to His grace,\n(686.58, 690.34)  He uses us to change all of the people around us.\n(690.34, 694.06)  And the last point that is so worth noting about St. Claire\n(694.06, 696.5)  is we see she had a beautiful friendship\n(696.5, 698.86)  with St. Francis of Assisi.\n(698.86, 701.82)  In fact, it was that friendship that inspired her\n(701.82, 704.3)  to pursue religious life.\n(704.3, 708.3)  Another note for us that saints inspire other saints\n(708.3, 710.06)  and that we can't get to heaven,\n(710.06, 714.04)  we can't become holy without holy friendships\n(714.04, 716.6)  because iron sharpens iron.\n(716.6, 720.42)  And so today we would do well to reflect and to thank God\n(720.42, 723.06)  for all of the other holy people in our lives\n(723.06, 726.1)  that have helped inspire us in the faith\n(726.1, 729.4)  because that's not an accident that he placed them there,\n(729.4, 732.2)  because we need to rely on one another to,\n(732.2, 734.52)  as the first reading says from Deuteronomy,\n(734.52, 737.4)  adhere to the commands of the Lord,\n(737.4, 740.68)  because when we do, this is for our good,\n(740.68, 742.32)  and we begin to rejoice,\n(742.32, 745.04)  and the world begins to rejoice with us.\n(745.04, 748.4)  And so today let us stand and make our prayers\n(748.4, 751.16)  and ask God for the grace to reform our hearts,\n(751.16, 753.7)  so in turn he can renew his church.\n(755.76, 753.7) \n(759.46, 763.58)  We pray for Pope Leo and for Bishop Richard Henning and for all bishops throughout the church. May God give them the grace to be true shepherds of souls\n(763.58, 769.96)  who inspire the zeal for holiness in their flocks. We pray to the Lord. We\n(769.96, 773.32)  pray for all civil leaders, governments, and elected officials throughout the\n(773.32, 776.94)  world. May they enact policies that protect the church and give her the\n(776.94, 780.64)  freedom to be herself so the kingdom of God can be spread to every corner of the\n(780.64, 786.52)  we pray to the Lord. We pray for an increase of vocations to the priesthood\n(786.52, 790.32)  and to the religious life, especially for members from our own parishes and our\n(790.32, 794.92)  own families. May the intercession of St. Clair of Assisi call many men and women\n(794.92, 801.32)  to give their lives entirely to God. We pray to the Lord. And in thanksgiving, we\n(801.32, 804.76)  thank the Lord for all of the holy friendships he has placed in our lives,\n(804.76, 810.56)  and they continue to inspire us to live for him. We pray to the Lord. And we\n(810.56, 816.74)  pray for our parishioners for whom this mass is offered we pray to the Lord\n(816.74, 821.12)  Heavenly Father we make these prayers with great confidence as we ask them\n(821.12, 824.9)  through the intercession of St. Clair of Assisi and we speak them in the name of\n(824.9, 829.26)  Mary our Morning Star and in the name of Jesus her son who is Lord forever\n(829.26, 832.58)  endeavor amen\n(900.56, 920.36)  Pray, brothers and sisters, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God the almighty\n(920.36, 928.8)  Father.\n(928.8, 933.8)  As we proclaim your wonders, O Lord, in the Virgin Blessed Clare, we humbly implore your\n(933.8, 940.24)  majesty that as her merits are pleasing to you, so too our dutiful service may find favor\n(940.24, 944.32)  in your sight, through Christ our Lord.\n(944.32, 946.92)  The Lord be with you.\n(946.92, 949.5)  Lift up your hearts.\n(949.5, 953.28)  Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.\n(953.28, 957.88)  It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, always and everywhere to give you\n(957.88, 962.6)  Lord, Holy Father, Almighty and Eternal God, for in the saints who consecrated\n(962.6, 966.64)  themselves to Christ for the sake of the kingdom of heaven, it is right to\n(966.64, 971.02)  celebrate the wonders of your Providence, by which you call human nature back to\n(971.02, 975.36)  its original holiness and bring it to experience on this earth the gifts you\n(975.36, 979.98)  promise in the new world to come. And so with all the angels and saints we praise\n(979.98, 987.4)  you, as without end we acclaim. Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts, heaven and earth\n(987.4, 989.4)  are full of your glory.\n(989.4, 991.4)  Hosanna in the highest.\n(991.4, 994.4)  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.\n(994.4, 996.4)  Hosanna in the highest.\n(998.4, 1000.4)  You are indeed holy, O Lord,\n(1000.4, 1003.4)  and all you have created rightly gives you praise.\n(1003.4, 1005.4)  For through your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ,\n(1005.4, 1008.4)  by the power and working of the Holy Spirit,\n(1008.4, 1011.4)  you give life to all things and make them holy.\n(1011.4, 1014.4)  And you never cease to gather a people to yourself\n(1014.4, 1016.4)  so that from the rising of the sun to its setting,\n(1016.4, 1020.04)  setting, a pure sacrifice may be offered to your name.\n(1020.04, 1025.44)  Therefore, O Lord, we humbly implore you, by the same Spirit graciously make holy these\n(1025.44, 1030.86)  gifts we have brought to you for consecration, that they may become the body and blood of\n(1030.86, 1036.66)  your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, at whose command we celebrate these mysteries.\n(1036.66, 1042.5)  For on the night he was betrayed, he himself took bread, and giving you thanks, he said\n(1042.5, 1048.5)  said the blessing, broke the bread, and gave it to his disciples, saying,\n(1048.5, 1060.5)  Take this, all of you, and eat of it, for this is my body, which will be given up for you.\n(1071.5, 1060.5) \n(1077.58, 1082.42)  In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took the chalice, and giving you thanks he said the blessing, and gave the chalice to his disciples, saying,\n(1082.42, 1091.14)  Take this, all of you, and drink from it, for this is the chalice of my blood, the\n(1091.14, 1095.74)  blood of the new and eternal covenant, which will be poured out for you and for\n(1095.74, 1102.74)  many for the forgiveness of sins. Do this in memory of me.\n(1112.42, 1123.46)  The mystery of faith. Save us, Savior of the world, for by your cross and resurrection,\n(1123.46, 1128.74)  you have set us free. Therefore, O Lord, as we celebrate the memorial of the saving passion\n(1128.74, 1133.48)  of your Son, his wondrous resurrection and ascension into heaven, and as we look forward\n(1133.48, 1138.9)  to his second coming, we offer you in thanksgiving this holy and living sacrifice. Look, we pray,\n(1138.9, 1140.86)  upon the oblation of your church,\n(1140.86, 1143.04)  and recognizing the sacrificial victim\n(1143.04, 1146.28)  by whose death you willed to reconcile us to yourself.\n(1146.28, 1147.82)  Grant that we who are nourished\n(1147.82, 1149.9)  by the body and blood of your son,\n(1149.9, 1151.34)  and filled with his Holy Spirit,\n(1151.34, 1154.22)  may become one body, one spirit in Christ.\n(1154.22, 1156.78)  May he make of us an eternal offering to you,\n(1156.78, 1159.58)  so that we may obtain an inheritance with your elect,\n(1159.58, 1162.94)  especially with the most blessed Virgin Mary, mother of God,\n(1162.94, 1164.88)  with blessed Joseph, her spouse,\n(1164.88, 1167.34)  with your blessed apostles and glorious martyrs,\n(1167.34, 1170.1)  with Saint Claire, and with all the saints,\n(1170.1, 1172.62)  on whose constant intercession in your presence,\n(1172.62, 1174.78)  we rely for unfailing help.\n(1174.78, 1178.34)  May this sacrifice of our reconciliation, we pray, O Lord,\n(1178.34, 1181.18)  advance the peace and salvation of all the world.\n(1181.18, 1183.3)  Be pleased to confirm in faith and charity\n(1183.3, 1184.88)  your pilgrim church on earth,\n(1184.88, 1188.38)  with your servant Leo, our pope, and Richard, our bishop,\n(1188.38, 1190.38)  the order of bishops, all the clergy,\n(1190.38, 1193.16)  and the entire people you have gained for your own.\n(1193.16, 1196.38)  Listen graciously to the prayers of this family,\n(1196.38, 1198.22)  whom you have summoned before you,\n(1198.22, 1200.6)  in your compassion and merciful Father,\n(1200.6, 1202.42)  gather to yourself all your children\n(1202.42, 1204.2)  scattered throughout the world.\n(1204.2, 1206.38)  To our departed brothers and sisters,\n(1206.38, 1207.66)  and to all who are pleasing to you\n(1207.66, 1209.6)  at their passing from this life,\n(1209.6, 1211.54)  give kind admittance to your kingdom,\n(1211.54, 1214.44)  there we hope to enjoy forever the fullness of your glory,\n(1214.44, 1215.88)  through Christ our Lord,\n(1215.88, 1218.64)  through whom you bestow on the world all that is good.\n(1223.2, 1226.0)  Through him and with him and in him,\n(1226.0, 1230.2)  O God, Almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\n(1230.2, 1233.56)  all glory and honor is yours forever and ever.\n(1235.92, 1239.8)  At the Savior's command and formed by divine teaching,\n(1239.8, 1244.28)  we dare to say, our Father who art in heaven,\n(1244.28, 1247.28)  hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come,\n(1247.28, 1250.6)  thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.\n(1250.6, 1253.08)  Give us this day our daily bread\n(1253.08, 1255.48)  and forgive us our trespasses\n(1255.48, 1258.84)  as we forgive those who trespass against us\n(1258.84, 1261.08)  and lead us not into temptation,\n(1261.08, 1263.0)  but deliver us from evil.\n(1263.0, 1265.24)  Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil.\n(1265.24, 1267.48)  Graciously grant peace in our days,\n(1267.48, 1268.84)  that by the help of your mercy\n(1268.84, 1272.48)  we may be always free from sin and safe from all distress\n(1272.48, 1273.74)  as we await the blessed hope\n(1273.74, 1276.48)  and the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ.\n(1280.64, 1283.16)  Lord Jesus Christ, you said to your apostles,\n(1283.16, 1285.4)  peace I leave you, my peace I give you.\n(1285.4, 1288.2)  look not on our sins, but on the faith of Your church,\n(1288.2, 1290.04)  and graciously grant her peace and unity\n(1290.04, 1291.52)  in accordance with Your will,\n(1291.52, 1294.08)  who live and reign forever and ever.\n(1294.08, 1297.04)  The peace of the Lord be with you always.\n(1297.04, 1299.2)  Let us offer each other the sign of peace.\n(1302.28, 1306.04)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world,\n(1306.04, 1307.8)  have mercy on us.\n(1307.8, 1311.24)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world,\n(1311.24, 1312.96)  have mercy on us.\n(1312.96, 1318.72)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world. Grant us peace.\n(1331.16, 1337.76)  Behold the Lamb of God. Behold him who takes away the sins of the world. Blessed\n(1337.76, 1342.44)  are those called to the Supper of the Lamb. Lord, I am not worthy that you\n(1342.44, 1349.32)  should enter under my roof but only say the word and my soul shall be healed.\n(1372.44, 1396.2)  This is the one thing I ask of the Lord, only this do I seek, to live in the house of the\n(1396.2, 1398.2)  for all the days of my life.\n(1634.2, 1649.48)  Let us pray.\n(1649.48, 1655.48)  Renewed by partaking of this divine gift, we pray, O Lord our God, that by the example\n(1655.48, 1661.48)  of the Blessed Clare, bearing in our body the death of Jesus, we may strive to hold\n(1661.48, 1663.56)  fast to You alone.\n(1663.56, 1670.42)  Christ our Lord. The Lord be with you. May Almighty God bless you, the Father and\n(1670.42, 1678.3)  the Son and the Holy Spirit. Go forth, the masses end in. St. Michael, the\n(1678.3, 1683.22)  Archangel, defend us in battle, be our protection against the wickedness and\n(1683.22, 1689.06)  snares of the devil. May God rebuke him, we humbly pray, and do thou the prince of\n(1689.06, 1695.24)  heavenly hosts by the power of God cast into hell Satan and all the evil spirits\n(1695.24, 1701.12)  who prowl about the world seeking the rune of souls amen\n(1749.06, 1774.06)  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n(1804.06, 1828.06)  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,\n(1828.06, 1829.06)  yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,\n(1829.06, 1830.06)  yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,\n(1830.06, 1831.06)  yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,\n(1831.06, 1832.06)  yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,\n(1832.06, 1833.06)  yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,\n(1833.06, 1862.92)  Thank you all for being here.\n(1863.06, 1865.06)  Thank you so much for joining us, and we'll see you next time.\n",

Praise the Lord, Jerusalem. Glorify the Lord, O Jerusalem. Praise\n(517.72, 525.4)  your God, O Zion, for he has strengthened the bars of your gates. He has blessed\n(525.4, 533.88)  your children within you. Praise the Lord, Jerusalem. He has granted peace in your\n(533.88, 538.6)  borders, with the best of wheat he fills you.\n(538.6, 548.44)  He sends forth his command to the earth, swiftly runs his word, praise the Lord Jerusalem.\n(548.44, 556.04)  He has proclaimed the word to Jacob, his statutes and his ordinances to Israel.\n(556.04, 559.96)  He has not done thus for any other nation.\n(559.96, 567.76)  audience ordinances he has not made known to them hallelujah praise the Lord\n(567.76, 570.84)  Jerusalem\n(583.12, 589.8)  the Lord be with you a reading from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew\n(589.8, 597.12)  As Jesus and his disciples were gathering in Galilee Jesus said to them the Son of\n(597.12, 601.5)  Man is to be handed over to men and they will kill him and he will be raised on\n(601.5, 606.18)  the third day and they were overwhelmed with grief. When they came to Capernaum\n(606.18, 610.62)  the collectors of the temple tax approached Peter and said does not your\n(610.62, 616.44)  teacher pay the temple tax? Yes he said. When he came into the house before he\n(616.44, 622.24)  had time to speak Jesus asked him what is your opinion Simon from whom do the\n(622.24, 627.12)  kings of the earth take tolls or census tax from their subjects or from\n(627.12, 632.52)  foreigners when he said from foreigners Jesus said to him then the subjects are\n(632.52, 638.38)  exempt but that we may not offend them go to the sea drop in a hook and take\n(638.38, 642.76)  the first fish that comes up open its mouth and you will find a coin worth\n(642.76, 645.16)  worth twice the temple tax.\n(645.16, 647.86)  Give that to them for me and for you.\n(647.86, 654.26)  The Gospel of the Lord.\n(654.26, 656.76)  A sign that there is a crisis of holiness\n(656.76, 658.66)  or sanctity in our modern age\n(658.66, 661.06)  is that whenever the question is presented,\n(661.06, 664.92)  what do we need to do to draw more people to the church?\n(664.92, 667.36)  Oftentimes, we jump to thinking\n(667.36, 670.96)  we have to change foundational structures\n(670.96, 676.24)  teachings of the church to draw more people, as if reforming something that was given to\n(676.24, 678.68)  us by Christ would be the answer.\n(678.68, 685.4)  And if we read just a little bit about church history, we see that the remedy to decay in\n(685.4, 688.04)  the church or in the world is always holiness.\n(688.04, 692.68)  And it begins from people like you and me, ordinary people, not saying what needs to\n(692.68, 699.24)  change about the church, but what do I need to change about my life to be completely given\n(699.24, 706.52)  over to God as we heard in the first reading from Deuteronomy to circumcise our hearts to adhere\n(706.52, 714.04)  wholly with our mind and our will to follow as Moses tells the people exactly what the Lord has\n(714.04, 720.44)  given to you because this is for your good we see from the saint we celebrate today Saint Claire of\n(720.44, 727.56)  Assisi this exact principle she was the first woman in the history of the church to write a\n(727.56, 734.64)  rule a way of life and create this religious order with the help of St. Francis, which\n(734.64, 738.48)  completely changed the course of history.\n(738.48, 745.98)  And she did this because she was so drawn to radically give her entire life to what\n(745.98, 750.28)  God has laid for us in the context of the church.\n(750.28, 757.3)  And so she did this by living a radical poverty and obedience, and it just drew so many followers.\n(757.3, 763.56)  And so the answer for us today is to prioritize our own holiness, and then the Lord will take\n(763.56, 765.28)  care of everything else.\n(765.28, 772.88)  And finally, the last lesson about St. Clair is we see that you need holy friendships in\n(772.88, 774.76)  order to become a saint.\n(774.76, 780.72)  St. Clair and St. Francis of Assisi were very good friends, and they pushed each other to\n(780.72, 786.76)  walk in the ways of the Lord, because we cannot get to heaven on our own.\n(786.76, 792.64)  And so we would do well today to thank God for all of the particular people He's placed\n(792.64, 797.64)  in our lives that have called us into a deeper holiness.\n(797.64, 803.92)  Because that is a very intentional part of God's plan, is forming holy friendships who\n(803.92, 810.28)  are also committed to walking and pursuing the one thing that matters, which is our relationship\n(810.28, 811.52)  with God.\n(811.52, 816.18)  And so today let us give God thanks for the witness of this saint who reminds us that\n(816.18, 821.54)  renewal from the church always starts from within and is done and accomplished\n(821.54, 826.86)  with other people pursuing sanctity running alongside of us and so let us\n(826.86, 832.74)  stand and make our petitions known to our Heavenly Father. We pray for Pope\n(832.74, 836.3)  Leo and for Bishop Richard Henning and for all bishops throughout the church.\n(836.3, 841.66)  May God give them the grace to be true shepherds of souls who inspire their\n(841.66, 847.9)  people to pursue holiness. We pray to the Lord. We pray for all civil leaders,\n(847.9, 850.84)  governments, and elected officials throughout the world. May they enact\n(850.84, 854.42)  policies that protect the church and give her the freedom to be herself so\n(854.42, 858.1)  the kingdom of God can be spread to every corner of the globe. We pray to the\n(858.1, 863.02)  Lord. We pray for an increase of vocations to the priesthood into the\n(863.02, 866.74)  religious life, especially for members from our own parishes and our own\n(866.74, 871.38)  families. May the intercession of St. Clair of Assisi call many men and women\n(871.38, 877.68)  to give their lives entirely to God we pray to the Lord and in thanksgiving we\n(877.68, 881.46)  thank the Lord for all of the people and holy friendships in our lives that have\n(881.46, 888.56)  helped us inspire us in the faith we pray to the Lord we pray for our\n(888.56, 893.9)  parishioners for whom this mass is offered we pray to the Lord heavenly\n(893.9, 897.42)  father we make these prayers with great confidence as we ask them to the\n(897.42, 899.86)  the intercession of Saint Claire and Mary,\n(899.86, 901.54)  our morning star and gate of heaven.\n(901.54, 903.94)  And we speak them in the name of Jesus, her son,\n(903.94, 905.88)  who is Lord forever and ever.\n(905.88, 906.72)  Amen.\n(987.42, 994.86)  Pray, brothers and sisters, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God, the Almighty\n(994.86, 1004.7)  Father.\n(1004.7, 1010.06)  As we proclaim your wonders, O Lord, in the Virgin Blessed Clare, we humbly implore your\n(1010.06, 1015.98)  majesty that as her merits are pleasing to you, so too our dutiful service may find favor\n(1015.98, 1017.3)  in your sight.\n(1017.3, 1025.58)  Christ our Lord the Lord be with you lift up your hearts let us give thanks to\n(1025.58, 1032.02)  the Lord our God it is truly right and just our duty and our salvation always\n(1032.02, 1036.82)  and everywhere to give you thanks Lord Holy Father Almighty and eternal God for\n(1036.82, 1040.62)  in the Saints who consecrated themselves to Christ for the sake of the kingdom of\n(1040.62, 1045.24)  heaven it is right to celebrate the wonders of your Providence by which you\n(1045.24, 1049.74)  call human nature back to its original holiness and bring it to experience on\n(1049.74, 1054.22)  this earth the gifts you promised in the new world to come and so with all the\n(1054.22, 1060.22)  angels and saints we praise you as without end we acclaim fully holy holy\n(1060.22, 1064.98)  Lord God of hosts heaven and earth are full of your glory\n(1064.98, 1070.22)  Hosanna in the highest blessed is he who comes from the name of the Lord\n(1070.22, 1072.46)  Hosanna in the highest.\n(1074.78, 1076.78)  You are indeed holy, O Lord,\n(1076.78, 1079.14)  and all you have created rightly gives you praise.\n(1079.14, 1081.98)  For through your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ,\n(1081.98, 1084.54)  by the power and working of the Holy Spirit,\n(1084.54, 1087.3)  you give life to all things and make them holy,\n(1087.3, 1090.1)  and you never cease to gather a people to yourself,\n(1090.1, 1092.94)  so that from the rising of the sun to its setting,\n(1092.94, 1096.18)  a pure sacrifice may be offered to your name.\n(1096.18, 1098.94)  Therefore, O Lord, we humbly implore you,\n(1098.94, 1101.86)  by the same Spirit graciously make holy these gifts\n(1101.86, 1104.04)  we have brought to you for consecration,\n(1104.04, 1106.9)  that they may become the body and blood\n(1106.9, 1109.7)  of your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ,\n(1109.7, 1112.86)  at whose command we celebrate these mysteries.\n(1112.86, 1115.54)  For on the night he was betrayed,\n(1115.54, 1118.58)  he himself took bread, and giving you thanks,\n(1118.58, 1121.34)  he said the blessing, broke the bread,\n(1121.34, 1123.82)  and gave it to his disciples, saying,\n(1125.14, 1123.82) \n(1134.46, 1150.42)  Take this, all of you, and eat of it, for this is my body, which will be given up for you.\n(1150.42, 1155.22)  In a similar way, when supper was ended, He took the chalice.\n(1155.22, 1160.82)  In giving you thanks, He said the blessing, and gave the chalice to His disciples, saying,\n(1160.82, 1169.82)  Take this, all of you, and drink from it, for this is the chalice of My blood, the blood\n(1169.82, 1174.7)  of the new and eternal covenant, which will be poured out for you and for many for the\n(1174.7, 1176.94)  forgiveness of sins.\n(1176.94, 1195.5)  Do this in memory of me.\n(1195.5, 1202.38)  The mystery of faith, save us, savior of the world, for by your cross and resurrection\n(1202.38, 1203.78)  you have set us free.\n(1203.78, 1208.78)  Therefore, O Lord, as we celebrate the memorial of the saving passion of Your Son,\n(1208.78, 1211.78)  His wondrous resurrection and ascension into heaven,\n(1211.78, 1213.78)  and as we look forward to His second coming,\n(1213.78, 1216.78)  we offer You in thanksgiving this holy and living sacrifice.\n(1216.78, 1219.78)  Look, we pray, upon the oblation of Your Church\n(1219.78, 1224.78)  in recognizing the sacrificial victim by whose death You willed to reconcile us to Yourself.\n(1224.78, 1228.78)  Grant that we who are nourished by the body and blood of Your Son\n(1228.78, 1232.78)  and filled with His Holy Spirit may become one body, one spirit in Christ.\n(1232.78, 1237.54)  May he make of us an eternal offering to you, so that we may obtain an inheritance with\n(1237.54, 1242.78)  your elect, especially with the most blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God, with blessed Joseph,\n(1242.78, 1247.58)  her spouse, with your blessed apostles and glorious martyrs, with St. Clair, and with\n(1247.58, 1253.58)  all the saints, on whose constant intercession in your presence we rely for unfailing help.\n(1253.58, 1258.4)  May this sacrifice of our reconciliation, we pray, O Lord, advance the peace and salvation\n(1258.4, 1259.4)  of all the world.\n(1259.4, 1261.64)  Be pleased to confirm in faith and charity\n(1261.64, 1263.16)  your pilgrim church on earth,\n(1263.16, 1265.32)  with your servant Leo, our pope,\n(1265.32, 1267.84)  and Richard, our bishop, the order of bishops,\n(1267.84, 1269.66)  all the clergy, and the entire people\n(1269.66, 1271.16)  you have gained for your own.\n(1272.16, 1275.16)  Listen graciously to the prayers of this family,\n(1275.16, 1276.84)  whom you have summoned before you,\n(1276.84, 1279.16)  and your compassionate and merciful father.\n(1279.16, 1280.92)  Gather to yourself all your children\n(1280.92, 1282.68)  scattered throughout the world,\n(1282.68, 1284.96)  to our departed brothers and sisters,\n(1284.96, 1286.26)  and to all who are pleasing to you\n(1286.26, 1288.2)  at their passing from this life.\n(1288.2, 1290.2)  Give kind admittance to your kingdom,\n(1290.2, 1293.36)  there we hope to enjoy forever the fullness of your glory,\n(1293.36, 1294.84)  through Christ our Lord,\n(1294.84, 1297.96)  through whom you be so in the world, all that is good.\n(1301.54, 1304.2)  Through him and with him and in him,\n(1304.2, 1306.24)  O God, almighty Father,\n(1306.24, 1308.52)  in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\n(1308.52, 1312.28)  all glory and honor is yours, forever and ever.\n(1314.48, 1312.28) \n(1314.52, 1318.68)  Amen. At the Savior's command, informed by divine teaching,\n(1318.68, 1323.12)  we dare to say, our Father, who art in heaven,\n(1323.12, 1324.78)  hallowed be thy name.\n(1324.78, 1327.6)  Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,\n(1327.6, 1329.72)  on earth as it is in heaven.\n(1329.72, 1332.32)  Give us this day our daily bread,\n(1332.32, 1334.68)  and forgive us our trespasses,\n(1334.68, 1338.06)  as we forgive those who trespass against us,\n(1338.06, 1340.4)  and lead us not into temptation,\n(1340.4, 1342.4)  but deliver us from evil.\n(1342.4, 1345.0)  Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil.\n(1345.0, 1347.28)  Graciously grant peace in our days,\n(1347.28, 1348.8)  that by the help of your mercy,\n(1348.8, 1352.72)  we may be always free from sin and safe from all distress,\n(1352.72, 1354.12)  as we await the blessed hope\n(1354.12, 1357.08)  and the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ.\n(1361.88, 1364.6)  Lord Jesus Christ, who said to your apostles,\n(1364.6, 1366.9)  peace I leave you, my peace I give you.\n(1366.9, 1369.8)  Look not in our sins, but on the faith of your church,\n(1369.8, 1371.8)  and graciously grant her peace and unity\n(1371.8, 1373.32)  in accordance with your will,\n(1373.32, 1375.84)  who live and reign forever and ever.\n(1375.84, 1378.0)  The peace of the Lord be with you always.\n(1378.88, 1381.2)  Let us offer each other the sign of peace.\n(1383.64, 1387.44)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world,\n(1387.44, 1389.4)  have mercy on us.\n(1389.4, 1392.52)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world,\n(1392.52, 1394.28)  have mercy on us.\n(1394.28, 1397.32)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world,\n(1397.32, 1398.62)  grant us peace.\n(1399.8, 1421.62)  Behold the Lamb of God. Behold him who takes away the sins of the world. Blessed are those\n(1421.62, 1426.78)  called to the supper of the Lamb. Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under\n(1426.78, 1430.7)  my roof, but only say the word and my soul shall be healed.\n(1456.78, 1475.78)  There is one thing I ask of the Lord, only this do I seek, to live in the house of the\n(1475.78, 1477.78)  all the days of my life.\n(1715.78, 1735.06)  Let us pray.\n(1735.06, 1741.06)  Renewed by partaking of this divine gift, we pray, O Lord our God, that by the example\n(1741.06, 1748.5)  the blessed clair of a season bearing in our body the death of jesus we may strive to hold fast\n(1748.5, 1755.78)  to you alone through christ our lord the lord be with you may almighty god\n",

Glory to God in the highest and on\n(361.6, 367.48)  earth peace to people of goodwill. We praise you, we bless you, we adore you, we\n(367.48, 374.96)  glorify you. We give you thanks for your great glory. Lord God, Heavenly King, O God\n(374.96, 382.7)  Almighty Father. Lord Jesus Christ, only begotten Son. Lord God, Lamb of God, Son of\n(382.7, 389.38)  of the Father. You take away the sins of the world, have mercy in us. You take away the\n(389.38, 395.74)  sins of the world, receive our prayer. You are seated at the right hand of the Father,\n(395.74, 402.22)  have mercy in us. For you alone are the Holy One, you alone are the Lord, you alone are\n(402.22, 410.9)  the Most High, Jesus Christ, with the Holy Spirit, in the glory of God the Father. Amen.\n(410.9, 419.12)  Let us pray.\n(419.12, 426.36)  O God who have prepared for those who love you good things which no eye can see, fill\n(426.36, 432.2)  our hearts, we pray, with the warmth of your love, so that loving you in all things and\n(432.2, 440.04)  above all things we may attain your promises which surpass every human desire.\n(440.04, 444.62)  You are, Lord Jesus Christ,\n(444.62, 458.8)  your Son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\n(458.8, 459.8)  God forever and ever.\n(459.8, 461.8)  A reading from the book of the Prophet Jeremiah.\n(461.8, 467.88)  In those days, the princes said to the king Jeremiah ought to be put to death, he is demoralizing\n(467.88, 472.64)  the soldiers who are left in this city, and all the people, by speaking such things to\n(472.64, 478.8)  them. He is not interested in the welfare of our people, but in their ruin. King Zedekiah\n(478.8, 485.6)  answered, He is in your power, for the king could do nothing with them. And so they took\n(485.6, 491.96)  Jeremiah and threw him into the cistern of Prince Malchia, which was in the quarters\n(491.96, 495.24)  of the guard,\n(495.8, 498.04)  letting him down with ropes.\n(498.04, 501.24)  There was no water in the cistern, only mud,\n(501.24, 504.44)  and Jeremiah sank into the mud.\n(504.44, 506.52)  Eben-Melech, a court official, went there from the palace and said to him,\n(506.52, 509.72)  My lord king, these men have been at fault\n(509.72, 512.68)  in all they have done to the prophet Jeremiah,\n(512.68, 516.36)  casting him into the cistern. He will die of famine\n(516.36, 520.76)  on the spot, for there is no more food in the city.\n(520.76, 525.54)  Then the king ordered\n(550.4, 525.54) \n(532.48, 554.2)  and draw the Prophet Jeremiah\n(532.48, 543.32)  the word of the Lord.\n(560.94, 543.32) \n(551.86, 566.14)  I waited for the Lord,\n(572.18, 573.32)  And he put a new song\n(582.36, 596.54)  of law and trust in the Lord.\n(600.68, 603.32)  A reading from the letter\n(607.86, 610.16)  Now, witnesses, let us rid ourselves of every\n(610.16, 612.66)  burden and sin that clings to us,\n(612.66, 615.16)  and persevere in running the race\n(615.16, 618.16)  that lies before us while keeping\n(618.16, 621.16)  our eyes fixed on Jesus,\n(621.16, 624.16)  the leader and perfecter of the faith.\n(624.16, 627.16)  For the sake of the joy that lay before him,\n(627.16, 629.16)  he endured the cross,\n(629.16, 631.16)  despising its shame,\n(631.16, 633.16)  and has taken his seat\n(633.16, 637.64)  to consider how he endured\n(661.7, 637.64) \n(640.08, 642.74)  you may not grow weary and lose heart in your struggle against sin.\n(642.74, 646.6)  You have not yet resisted to the point of shedding blood.\n(649.08, 650.14)  The word of the Lord.\n(667.64, 678.52)  the Lord be with you a reading from the Holy Gospel according to Luke Jesus said\n(678.52, 685.28)  to his disciples I have come to set the earth on fire and how I wish it were\n(685.28, 691.64)  already blazing there is a baptism with which I must be baptized and how great\n(691.64, 697.1)  is my anguish until it is accomplished do you think that I have come to\n(697.1, 704.3)  establish peace on the earth? No, I tell you, but rather division. From now on a\n(704.3, 709.98)  household of five will be divided, three against two and two against three. A\n(709.98, 715.82)  father will be divided against his son and a son against his father, a mother\n(715.82, 720.34)  against her daughter and a daughter against her mother, a mother-in-law\n(720.34, 724.48)  law against her daughter-in-law, and a daughter-in-law against her\n(724.48, 731.48)  mother-in-law. The Gospel of the Lord.\n(736.48, 741.46)  My friends, do you remember when the risen Christ appeared to his disciples at\n(741.46, 747.72)  Easter, and he greeted them by saying, peace be with you. Do you remember earlier\n(747.72, 752.88)  when he promised the gift of the Holy Spirit, and he said peace I give you, my\n(752.88, 759.48)  own peace I give you. And yet here in the Gospel today he says do you think I have\n(759.48, 766.8)  come to establish peace on the earth? No, I tell you, but rather division. Apart from\n(766.8, 773.76)  being a shock, and it is a shock, isn't it also a contradiction? Well I don't think\n(773.76, 781.8)  think so. A rock in the middle of a river divides the flowing water, not because it\n(781.8, 789.08)  wants to, but because it is there. If we stand firmly and stubbornly to Christian\n(789.08, 795.84)  faith and values, we are going to meet opposition and cause division. The prophet\n(795.84, 801.8)  Jeremiah in the first reading met such opposition, and Christ too met it to the\n(801.8, 808.84)  point of crucifixion. Our Lord is not out to put people fighting or causing\n(808.84, 814.84)  division, especially in families. He is simply saying that the Christian\n(814.84, 822.32)  message of its nature is bound to provoke opposition even in families, and\n(822.32, 828.36)  as well as that, he is saying if you want to be a follower of mine, you have to\n(828.36, 835.46)  have the courage of your conviction. You've got to have guts. When Jesus says\n(835.46, 842.64)  and the church says love one another as I have loved you, nobody objects. In fact\n(842.64, 850.2)  most people agree. But when he pushes us and says love your enemies, not everybody\n(850.2, 856.26)  can go with that. When Jesus and the church says not to kill, not to take\n(856.26, 864.14)  innocent life. We're all on board with that. We are happy to protect life, to\n(864.14, 869.74)  protect life in the middle, if you will, but when it gets to the difficulties of\n(869.74, 877.38)  beginning and end issues, it gets more contested and difficult. The fact is that\n(877.38, 884.66)  certain of Jesus' teachings do give rise to conflict and dissent\n(884.66, 890.46)  within ourselves first of all and then in our families and community.\n(890.46, 897.66)  There can be generational conflicts in families when attitudes and values that\n(897.66, 903.06)  are treasured by one say an older generation are not so important to\n(903.06, 910.26)  another. Your convictions as a parent or grandparent may be at odds with those of\n(910.26, 916.74)  your children or grandchildren. Your most cherished beliefs and practices may hold\n(916.74, 925.2)  little interest to them. It may seem at times that you live in different worlds.\n(925.2, 932.7)  May I say a few things as gently and as honestly as possible. If we believe in\n(932.7, 938.56)  Christ's teachings as mediated to us in Scripture and in the Church, we shouldn't\n(938.56, 944.48)  compromised for anybody. We should hold to the Christian faith that we have\n(944.48, 955.56)  received. We hold to it in faith, but also we hold to it in love. If I got a penny\n(955.56, 961.2)  for every parent or grandparent who lamented the fact that their children or\n(961.2, 968.8)  grandchildren no longer practice or do so seldomly, I would be a wealthy man. If I\n(968.8, 973.84)  got a dime for every parent or grandparent who expressed concern say\n(973.84, 980.84)  about the relationship situation of their children, I'd be a millionaire. We\n(980.84, 987.76)  believe that if we are to grow in faith and love, it is important to pray as a\n(987.76, 993.3)  community at our Sunday Mass. We believe that human love calls for\n(993.3, 1002.16)  responsibility. If our children reject these, we don't respond by rejecting our\n(1002.16, 1009.44)  children. We have too many faults ourselves to be dismissive of others.\n(1009.44, 1018.62)  Remember, faith is not likely to revive when love breaks down. Recently a\n(1018.62, 1024.34)  grandmother intervened from heaven. She intervened from heaven a year after she\n(1024.34, 1029.26)  died. Her grandmother was planning her wedding and did not intend getting\n(1029.26, 1035.62)  married in church. And then the memory of her grandmother's fidelity and devotion\n(1035.62, 1042.94)  to God touched her and she decided to get married in church. Live with\n(1042.94, 1051.06)  conviction, yes, but conviction with compassion, conviction with understanding,\n(1051.06, 1060.02)  conviction with love and humility. Stick to your guns, yes, but for God's sake\n(1060.02, 1068.3)  don't shoot anybody. We are blessed in our parish community to have a mixture\n(1068.3, 1077.18)  of old and young, of new and old. It is a great joy to see young adults and young\n(1077.18, 1084.62)  families join us for Sunday Mass. A shout out to all of you down there at the back.\n(1084.62, 1093.08)  When a baby cries out in church, God smiles. It is never a disturbance. The\n(1093.08, 1099.04)  baby is fully entitled to be here. It's just his or her way of saying they want\n(1099.04, 1107.0)  to be in the choir. So allow me a word to the younger. The growth of Christianity,\n(1107.0, 1113.52)  the further spreading of the good news, depends on the generous cooperation of\n(1113.52, 1122.28)  us all. It depends in a special way on young people. Please be conscious of your\n(1122.28, 1129.52)  responsibility. The baton of faith is passed on to you and then you pass it\n(1129.52, 1138.8)  on to others. Run with it as far as you can, don't let it drop. But if you do, that\n(1138.8, 1145.4)  is not the end. Remember too that you are not just bringing with you a set of\n(1145.4, 1153.96)  beliefs, a moral code, a number of values. No, as Pope Francis and now Pope Leo\n(1153.96, 1162.6)  constantly remind us, you bring your love of a person, of Jesus Christ. Be faithful\n(1162.6, 1169.92)  to Jesus Christ. Be part of his community, the Church. Know that his saving presence\n(1169.92, 1178.98)  is in your life, in your relationships, in your work, and in your play. Young and old,\n(1178.98, 1188.6)  male and female, black, white, brown, straight, gay, feeble, and strong. Let this gathering\n(1188.6, 1196.04)  nurture our faith, strengthen our hope, and give shape to our love.\n(1197.8, 1202.92)  We stand together on the shoulders of generations who have gone before us.\n(1204.84, 1212.76)  Let there be peace on earth, not a peace of convenience or compromise, but Christ's own\n(1212.76, 1219.32)  peace that is born out of hearts of faith-filled women and men who seek in\n(1219.32, 1226.6)  love to do what is true, what is noble, and what is just.\n(1242.76, 1255.64)  I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, and of all things\n(1255.64, 1262.76)  visible and invisible. I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God,\n(1262.76, 1269.04)  born of the Father before all ages, God from God, Light from Light, true God from true\n(1269.04, 1276.92)  God, begotten not made, consubstantial with the Father. Through him all things were made.\n(1276.92, 1283.88)  For us and for our salvation he came down from heaven, and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate\n(1283.88, 1290.92)  of the Virgin Mary and became man. For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate,\n(1290.92, 1295.92)  he suffered death and was buried, and rose again in the third day in accordance with\n(1295.92, 1301.94)  the Scriptures. He ascended to heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father.\n(1301.94, 1307.36)  He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead, and his kingdom will have no\n(1307.36, 1314.36)  end. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father\n(1314.36, 1320.48)  and the Son, who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified, who has spoken through\n(1320.48, 1327.0)  of the prophets. I believe in one holy Catholic and apostolic church, I confess\n(1327.0, 1332.52)  one baptism for the forgiveness of sins, and I look forward to the resurrection\n(1332.52, 1340.12)  of the dead and the life of the world to come. Amen. With confidence in the Lord\n(1340.12, 1346.08)  who saves us, we present him with our needs.\n(1347.68, 1346.08) \n(1357.88, 1358.88)  May the Lord pour out his spirit upon her, sanctifying her in truth and love, we pray to the Lord.\n(1358.88, 1361.76)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1361.76, 1366.96)  For all nations and people of the world, may the Lord bring peace and justice to every\n(1366.96, 1368.1)  land.\n(1368.1, 1373.54)  We especially pray for the people of the Middle East, Sudan, and Ukraine.\n(1373.54, 1374.84)  We pray to the Lord.\n(1374.84, 1380.34)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1380.64, 1385.78)  May the generous love of God\n(1385.78, 1388.78)  comfort them in their sorrow.\n(1388.78, 1389.78)  We pray to the Lord.\n(1389.78, 1390.78)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1390.78, 1391.78)  For those who are sick at home\n(1391.78, 1392.78)  or in the hospital,\n(1392.78, 1393.78)  may they experience\n(1393.78, 1394.78)  the closeness of God\n(1394.78, 1395.78)  in the care and concern\n(1395.78, 1397.78)  of their families\n(1397.78, 1399.78)  and those who care for them.\n(1399.78, 1401.78)  We pray to the Lord.\n(1401.78, 1403.78)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1403.78, 1404.78)  For all the faithful\n(1404.78, 1410.02)  The joyful departed,\n(1433.08, 1410.02) \n(1415.16, 1415.26)  for whom this Mass is offered,\n(1416.76, 1416.86)  for Patrick Sheehan,\n(1418.06, 1418.16)  John Camerata,\n(1420.2, 1420.3)  and for all our deceased relatives,\n(1421.9, 1422.0)  friends, and parishioners.\n(1424.6, 1424.7)  May they enjoy the companionship of God\n(1426.64, 1426.74)  and all the saints in Heaven.\n(1428.34, 1428.44)  We pray to the Lord.\n(1431.04, 1431.14)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1432.98, 1433.08)  May the silent prayers in our hearts\n(1434.74, 1434.84)  be lifted up to God,\n(1437.82, 1440.02)  who knows our needs even before we ask.\n(1442.58, 1448.34)  Lord, hear our prayer. Merciful Father, we humbly ask you to hear these prayers through Christ our Lord.\n(1470.02, 1477.22)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through your goodness we've received the\n(1477.22, 1482.58)  bread we offer you, fruit of the earth and work of human hands, it will become for us\n(1482.58, 1495.82)  the bread of life.\n(1495.82, 1499.34)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through your goodness we've received the\n(1499.34, 1505.68)  wine we offer you, fruit of the vine and work of human hands, it will become our spiritual\n(1505.68, 1522.68)  drink.\n(1522.68, 1529.04)  Pray my sisters and brothers that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God the Almighty\n(1529.04, 1542.44)  Father receive our oblation o Lord by which is brought about a glorious\n(1542.44, 1548.32)  exchange that by offering what you have given we may merit to receive your very\n(1548.32, 1557.16)  self through Christ our Lord the Lord be with you lift up your hearts let us give\n(1557.16, 1563.76)  thanks to the Lord our God. It is truly right and just, our duty and our\n(1563.76, 1569.52)  salvation, always and everywhere to give you thanks, Father Most Holy, through your\n(1569.52, 1574.72)  beloved Son Jesus Christ, your Word through whom you made all things, whom he\n(1574.72, 1579.88)  has sent as our Savior and Redeemer, incarnate by the Holy Spirit and born of\n(1579.88, 1585.64)  the Virgin. Fulfilling your will and gaining for you a holy people, he\n(1585.64, 1591.36)  He stretched out his hands as he endured his passion, so as to break the bonds of death\n(1591.36, 1594.28)  and manifest the resurrection.\n(1594.28, 1600.52)  And so with the angels and all the saints, we declare your glory, as with one voice we\n(1600.52, 1601.52)  acclaim.\n(1601.52, 1609.56)  Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts, heaven and earth are full of your glory, Hosanna\n(1609.56, 1611.52)  in the highest.\n(1611.52, 1621.36)  is he who comes in the name of the Lord Hosanna in the highest. You are indeed\n(1621.36, 1626.24)  holy O Lord of the fount of all holiness. Make holy therefore these\n(1626.24, 1632.56)  gifts we pray by sending down your spirit upon them like the dewfall so\n(1632.56, 1639.76)  that they may become for us the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ. At the\n(1639.76, 1647.28)  time he was betrayed and entered willingly into his passion. He took bread, and giving thanks,\n(1647.28, 1654.4)  broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, Take this, all of you, and eat of it,\n(1655.12, 1659.28)  for this is my body, which will be given up for you.\n(1669.44, 1659.28) \n(1669.7, 1675.78)  you. In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took the chalice, and once more, giving thanks,\n(1675.78, 1682.8)  he gave it to his disciples, saying, Take this, all of you, and drink from it. For this\n(1682.8, 1688.74)  is the chalice of my blood, the blood of the new and eternal covenant, which will be poured\n(1688.74, 1705.52)  out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Do this in memory of me.\n(1705.52, 1713.18)  The mystery of faith. We proclaim your death, O Lord, and profess your resurrection until\n(1713.18, 1718.86)  you come again. Therefore, as we celebrate the memorial of his death and\n(1718.86, 1723.46)  resurrection, we offer you, Lord, the bread of life and the chalice of\n(1723.46, 1729.54)  salvation, giving thanks that you have held us worthy to be in your presence\n(1729.54, 1735.32)  and minister to you. Humbly, we pray, that partaking of the body and blood of\n(1735.32, 1742.22)  Christ, we may be gathered into one by the Holy Spirit. Remember, Lord, your\n(1742.22, 1749.5)  Church spread throughout the world, and bring her to the fullness of charity, together with\n(1749.5, 1756.18)  Leo our Pope, Richard our Bishop, and all who minister in your Church.\n(1756.18, 1762.54)  Remember also our brothers and sisters who have fallen asleep in the hope of the Resurrection,\n(1762.54, 1765.94)  and all who have died in your mercy.\n(1765.94, 1769.8)  Welcome them into the light of your face.\n(1769.8, 1775.56)  Have mercy in us all, we pray, that with the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God and Gate\n(1775.56, 1781.96)  of Heaven, with Blessed Joseph her spouse, with the Blessed Apostles, St. Bridget, St.\n(1781.96, 1788.44)  Augustine and all the saints who have pleased you throughout the ages, we may merit to be\n(1788.44, 1797.92)  co-heirs to eternal life and may praise and glorify you through your Son, Jesus Christ.\n(1797.92, 1803.66)  Through him and with him and in him, O God Almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy\n(1803.66, 1812.46)  Spirit all glory and honor is yours, forever and ever, Amen.\n(1812.46, 1822.04)  At the Saviour's command and formed by divine teaching, we dare to say, Our Father, who\n(1822.04, 1830.02)  who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as\n(1830.02, 1837.32)  it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we\n(1837.32, 1844.02)  forgive those who trespass against us, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us\n(1844.02, 1851.2)  from evil. Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil. Graciously grant peace in our\n(1851.2, 1858.8)  days, that by the help of your mercy we may be always free from sin and safe\n(1858.8, 1864.84)  from all distress as we await the blessed hope and the coming of our\n(1864.84, 1868.32)  Savior Jesus Christ.\n(1870.6, 1877.04)  Lord Jesus Christ who said to your Apostles, Peace I leave you, my peace I\n(1877.04, 1884.06)  I give you. Look not on our sins but on the faith of your Church, and graciously grant\n(1884.06, 1893.42)  her peace and unity in accordance with your will, who live and reign for ever and ever.\n(1893.42, 1899.7)  The peace of the Lord be with you always. Let us offer each other the sign of peace.\n(1907.04, 1916.18)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1916.18, 1921.78)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1921.78, 1934.54)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, grant us peace.\n(1934.54, 1936.88)  Behold the Lamb of God.\n(1936.88, 1943.68)  him who takes away the sins of the world. Blessed are those called to the Supper of\n(1943.68, 1950.28)  the Lamb. Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof, but only say\n(1950.28, 1954.64)  the word and my soul shall be healed.\n(1966.88, 1976.56)  I am the living bread that came down from heaven, says the Lord.\n(1976.56, 1979.4)  Whoever eats of this bread will live forever.\n(2115.88, 2116.88)  Okay.\n(2116.88, 2117.88)  Okay.\n(2117.88, 2118.88)  Okay.\n(2118.88, 2119.88)  Okay.\n(2119.88, 2120.88)  Okay.\n(2120.88, 2121.88)  Okay.\n(2121.88, 2122.88)  Okay.\n(2122.88, 2123.88)  Okay.\n(2123.88, 2124.88)  Okay.\n(2124.88, 2125.88)  Okay.\n(2125.88, 2126.88)  Okay.\n(2126.88, 2127.88)  Okay.\n(2127.88, 2128.88)  Okay.\n(2128.88, 2129.88)  Okay.\n(2129.88, 2130.88)  Okay.\n(2130.88, 2131.88)  Okay.\n(2131.88, 2132.88)  Okay.\n(2132.88, 2133.88)  Okay.\n(2133.88, 2134.88)  Okay.\n(2134.88, 2135.88)  Okay.\n(2135.88, 2136.88)  Okay.\n(2136.88, 2137.88)  Okay.\n(2137.88, 2138.88)  Okay.\n(2138.88, 2139.88)  Okay.\n(2139.88, 2140.88)  Okay.\n(2140.88, 2141.88)  Okay.\n(2141.88, 2142.88)  Okay.\n(2142.88, 2143.88)  Okay.\n(2143.88, 2144.88)  Okay.\n(2174.88, 2179.88)  Thank you so much for joining us, and we'll see you next time.\n(2233.88, 2262.36)  O sacrament, most holy, O sacrament divine, All praise and all thanksgiving be every moment\n(2262.36, 2269.16)  line.

Amen.\n(576.94, 575.94) \n(584.24, 589.56)  Let us pray, Almighty ever-living God, whom taught by the Holy Spirit we dare to call our Father, bring we pray to perfection in our hearts the spirit of\n(589.56, 594.12)  adoption as your sons and daughters, that we may merit to enter into the\n(594.12, 598.64)  inheritance which you have promised, through our Lord Jesus Christ your Son,\n(598.64, 603.24)  who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God forever\n(603.24, 614.68)  ever and ever.\n(614.82, 618.18)  A reading from the Book of Wisdom.\n(618.26, 622.86)  The night of the Passover was known beforehand to our fathers\n(622.92, 626.5)  that with sure knowledge the oaths in which they put their\n(626.56, 630.66)  faith, they might have courage.\n(630.74, 630.66) \n(637.22, 644.9)  Your people awaited the salvation of the just and the destruction of their foes. For when you punished our adversaries, in this you glorified us whom you had summoned.\n(644.9, 652.38)  For in secret the holy children of the good were offering sacrifice and putting into effect\n(652.38, 657.62)  with one accord the divine institution.\n(657.62, 661.62)  with the word of the Lord.\n(661.62, 680.64)  \ud83c\udfb5\n(680.64, 701.0)  Blessed the people the Lord\n(701.3, 710.4)  Exalt, you just in the Lord.\n(710.64, 715.24)  said the nation whose God is the Lord,\n(715.24, 721.24)  the people he has chosen for his own inheritance.\n(721.24, 726.74)  Blessed are the people the Lord has chosen,\n(726.74, 731.74)  chosen to be his own.\n(731.74, 738.24)  See, the eyes of the Lord are upon those who fear him,\n(738.24, 743.3)  upon those who hope for his kindness,\n(743.3, 747.1)  to deliver them from death\n(747.1, 752.9)  and preserve them in spite of famine.\n(752.9, 758.2)  Blessed the people the Lord has chosen,\n(758.2, 763.5)  chosen to be his own.\n(763.5, 768.0)  Our soul waits for the Lord,\n(768.0, 772.34)  who is our help and our shield.\n(772.34, 775.44)  May your kindness, O Lord,\n(775.44, 777.9)  be upon us,\n(777.9, 782.9)  who have put our hope in you.\n(783.9, 786.1)  Blessed are the people\n(786.1, 789.1)  the Lord has chosen,\n(789.1, 794.1)  chosen to be his own.\n(798.0, 815.28)  A reading from the Letter to the Hebrews.\n(815.28, 822.24)  Brothers and sisters, faith is the realization of what is hoped for and evidence of things\n(822.24, 824.84)  not seen.\n(824.84, 831.48)  because of it the ancients\n(853.34, 831.48) \n(838.36, 845.44)  called to go out to a place that he was to receive as an inheritance. He went out not knowing where he was to go. By faith he sojourned in the promised land as in\n(845.44, 853.64)  a foreign country, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, heirs of the same promise.\n(853.64, 859.96)  For he was looking forward to the city with foundations whose architect and\n(859.96, 869.4)  and maker is God. By faith he received power to generate, even though he was past the normal age,\n(870.36, 877.8)  and Sarah herself was sterile, for he thought that the one who had made the promise was trustworthy.\n(879.32, 887.48)  So it was that there came forth from one man himself as good as dead, descendants as numerous\n(887.48, 895.18)  as the stars in the sky and as countless as the sands on the seashore.\n(895.18, 897.62)  All these died in faith.\n(897.62, 904.06)  They did not receive what had been promised, but saw it and greeted it from afar and acknowledged\n(904.06, 908.74)  themselves to be strangers and aliens on earth.\n(908.74, 914.06)  For those who speak thus show that they are seeking a homeland.\n(914.06, 918.58)  they had been thinking of the land from which they had come, they would have had\n(918.58, 926.6)  opportunity to return, but now they desire a better homeland, a heavenly one.\n(926.6, 932.78)  Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a\n(932.78, 942.22)  city for them. By faith Abraham, when put to the test, offered up Isaac, and he who\n(942.22, 949.76)  who had received the promises\n(951.56, 951.6)  was ready to offer his only son of whom it was said,\n(951.6, 954.6)  through Isaac descendants shall bear your name.\n(954.6, 959.6)  He reasoned that God was able to raise even from the dead,\n(959.6, 964.28)  and he received Isaac back as a symbol.\n(964.28, 969.28)  The word of the Lord.\n(969.28, 995.12)  Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah.\n(995.12, 1008.12)  Stay awake and be ready for you do not know on what day your Lord will come.\n(1008.12, 1018.12)  Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.\n(1018.12, 1020.12)  The Lord be with you.\n(1020.12, 1024.92)  A reading from the Holy Gospel according to Luke.\n(1024.92, 1027.92)  Jesus said to his disciples,\n(1027.92, 1030.92)  Do not be afraid any longer, little flock,\n(1030.92, 1033.92)  for your Father is pleased to give you the kingdom.\n(1033.92, 1036.42)  Sell your belongings and give alms.\n(1036.42, 1039.42)  Provide money bags for yourselves that do not wear out,\n(1039.42, 1041.92)  and an exhaustible treasure in heaven,\n(1041.92, 1044.92)  that no thief can reach, nor a moth destroy.\n(1044.92, 1048.92)  For where your treasure is, there also will your heart be.\n(1048.92, 1053.76)  Gird your loins and light your lamps, and be like servants who await their\n(1053.76, 1058.56)  Master's return from a wedding, ready to open immediately when he comes and knocks.\n(1058.56, 1063.6)  Blessed are those servants whom the Master finds vigilant on his arrival.\n(1063.6, 1069.26)  Amen, I say to you. He will gird himself, have them recline at table and proceed\n(1069.26, 1073.36)  to wait on them. And should he come in the second or third watch and find them\n(1073.36, 1078.84)  prepared in this way, blessed are those servants. Be sure of this, if the\n(1078.84, 1082.74)  The master of the house had known the hour when the thief was coming.\n(1082.74, 1086.02)  He would not have let his house be broken into.\n(1086.02, 1092.34)  You also must be prepared, for in an hour you do not expect the Son of Man will come.'\n(1092.34, 1097.4)  Then Peter said, Lord, is this parable meant for us or for everyone?\n(1097.4, 1102.84)  And the Lord replied, Who then is the faithful and prudent steward, whom the master will\n(1102.84, 1108.42)  put in charge of his servants, to distribute the food allowance at the proper time?\n(1108.42, 1112.7)  What is that servant whom his master on arrival finds doing so?\n(1112.7, 1117.74)  Truly I say to you, the master will put the servant in charge of all his property.\n(1117.74, 1120.14)  But if that servant says to himself,\n(1120.14, 1125.52)  My master is delayed in coming, and begins to beat the men servants and the maid servants,\n(1125.52, 1129.84)  to eat and drink and get drunk, then that servant's master will come,\n(1129.84, 1132.82)  on an unexpected day and an unknown hour,\n(1132.82, 1137.7)  and will punish the servant severely, and assign him a place with the unfaithful.\n(1137.7, 1145.7)  The servant who knew his master's will, but did not make preparations nor act in accord with his will, shall be beaten severely.\n(1145.7, 1153.7)  And the servant who was ignorant of his master's will, but acted in a way deserving of a severe beating, shall be beaten only lightly.\n(1153.7, 1160.7)  Much will be required of the person entrusted with much, and still more will be demanded of the person entrusted with more.\n(1160.7, 1162.7)  The Gospel of the Lord.\n(1167.7, 1176.6)  Yesterday, there was a group of 45 young people from our parish that went up to this river\n(1176.6, 1181.68)  in New Hampshire to go canoeing and we had a wonderful day and one of the highlights\n(1181.68, 1187.24)  of the day for me was at the beach where we stopped, there was this massive rope swing\n(1187.24, 1193.72)  and you had to climb up about 12 feet in the air and get on the swing and literally throw\n(1193.72, 1199.88)  yourself off the tree and into the water. And we observed many different people\n(1199.88, 1207.52)  attempt to use said rope swing. And I share this with you because this is very\n(1207.52, 1214.6)  emblematic of the act of faith that we hear described in our second reading\n(1214.6, 1220.52)  about Abraham who's the father of faith. Here were the different approaches. Some\n(1220.52, 1228.0)  Some people would very timidly climb the ladder and not get to the highest step, which made\n(1228.0, 1232.62)  it far easier to throw themselves off.\n(1232.62, 1241.58)  And though it seemed like the safer option, if you did that, it was very hard to clear\n(1241.58, 1245.46)  the rocks and make it safely into the water.\n(1245.46, 1255.82)  And so though it seemed like a risk, going two feet in without looking back was the safest\n(1255.82, 1258.86)  way to flourish.\n(1258.86, 1261.62)  What does this tell us about faith?\n(1261.62, 1266.32)  Faith is more often than not very misunderstood.\n(1266.32, 1272.64)  A lot of people think that faith is just a blind acceptance of something where we have\n(1272.64, 1283.2)  no reason or evidence for, and that's actually not true. Faith is supernatural,\n(1283.2, 1292.32)  which means it's above reason. It is a gift from God, but our reason takes us to\n(1292.32, 1298.44)  the edge. We don't throw our reason out the window when we make an act of faith.\n(1298.44, 1304.02)  How does this relate to our analogy? The person, before they climb the ladder, they\n(1304.02, 1309.74)  could size it up. Okay, I think I can get up there. I know if I fall, this could\n(1309.74, 1319.3)  happen, but eventually, when you are in position, you have to throw yourself off\n(1319.3, 1328.9)  and you have to trust the people who have gone before and have spoken that is\n(1328.9, 1336.38)  actually a safe thing to do. Abraham, our father in faith, what's the\n(1336.38, 1344.64)  lesson from him? Abraham was asked to leave his land as a reading said to\n(1344.64, 1351.6)  sojourned to an unfamiliar territory. He was 75 years old. He had no prospects and\n(1351.6, 1358.64)  the only reason that God could make him a father to the nations is because in\n(1358.64, 1369.08)  faith he went two feet in. He threw himself off boldly and then the Lord was\n(1369.08, 1376.12)  able to use him the way that God wanted. What's the lesson for us? So often in our\n(1376.12, 1382.52)  spiritual lives we have one foot attached to the tree and then we give\n(1382.52, 1391.6)  this half leap toward God and we hit all the rocks along the way. To follow God in\n(1391.6, 1397.92)  faith, the Catechism makes this clear that faith also involves the will. It's\n(1397.92, 1404.28)  not just an intellectual thing. Oh, I believe this truth revealed by God. Yes, I\n(1404.28, 1413.72)  believe it, but then I cling to it with my whole being. Too feeding. The faith is\n(1413.72, 1421.44)  something that needs to be lived and made concrete by our actions, boldly. And\n(1421.44, 1430.46)  last, what else do we glean from Abraham? In order to make this leap, we have to be\n(1430.46, 1441.78)  willing to sacrifice our Isaac. Isaac was Abraham's most cherished possession, was\n(1441.78, 1451.5)  his only son, from whom the promise was supposed to come, and God asked Abraham\n(1451.5, 1459.22)  in faith to surrender control of even that. Every one of us in this church,\n(1459.22, 1467.34)  including me, we have an Isaac. Something we cling to that we obsess over and we\n(1467.34, 1471.54)  think we need to control to be happy. Maybe it's like your plan for a\n(1471.54, 1478.68)  relationship or finding a relationship. I'm in complete control of this thing\n(1478.68, 1491.84)  and I won't relinquish in faith. When God asks us to sacrifice that Isaac, he\n(1491.84, 1499.24)  returns it a hundredfold, sometimes in ways we can't imagine. We would do well\n(1499.24, 1506.12)  to follow our Father in faith and think about what is that thing? Control of my\n(1506.12, 1513.32)  life, my career, my plans. Maybe I just never put myself out there, maybe I never\n(1513.32, 1519.24)  take a productive risk to grow personally, humanly, or in my faith. I\n(1519.24, 1527.68)  just cling to my little routine. Maybe that's the Isaac that God wants you to\n(1527.68, 1534.06)  release. Because when we follow the One who has spoken, our Father who can be\n(1534.06, 1541.68)  trusted, who overcomes even death, we can throw ourselves out with confidence two\n(1541.68, 1549.28)  feet in and know that the Lord will bless us and the world through us like\n(1549.28, 1553.6)  He did our Father in faith abundantly.\n(1557.68, 1567.9)  And so let us stand and profess our faith. I believe in one God, the Father\n(1567.9, 1573.22)  Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all things visible and invisible. I\n(1573.22, 1578.82)  believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, born of the\n(1578.82, 1584.38)  Father before all ages, God from God, light from light, true God from true God,\n(1584.38, 1589.62)  Begotten, not me, consubstantial with the Father. Through him all things were made.\n(1589.62, 1594.58)  For us men and for our salvation he came down from heaven, and by the Holy Spirit\n(1594.58, 1599.74)  was incarnate of the Virgin Mary and became man. For our sake he was crucified\n(1599.74, 1604.42)  under Pontius Pilate, he suffered death and was buried, and rose again on the\n(1604.42, 1608.3)  third day in accordance with the Scriptures. He ascended into heaven and\n(1608.3, 1612.1)  is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will come again in glory to\n(1612.1, 1616.14)  to judge the living and the dead, and his kingdom will have no end.\n(1616.14, 1621.2)  I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father\n(1621.2, 1626.1)  and the Son, who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified, who has spoken through\n(1626.1, 1627.1)  the prophets.\n(1627.1, 1631.12)  I believe in one holy, catholic and apostolic church.\n(1631.12, 1635.94)  I confess one baptism for the forgiveness of sins, and I look forward to the resurrection\n(1635.94, 1639.42)  of the dead, and the life of the world to come.\n(1639.42, 1640.78)  Amen.\n(1640.78, 1643.68)  Turning towards our Heavenly\n(1643.68, 1646.48)  Father with great confidence,\n(1646.48, 1648.48)  we make our petitions known to Him.\n(1648.48, 1651.48)  For all members of the Church,\n(1651.48, 1654.48)  may the Lord grant us wisdom and humility\n(1654.48, 1656.48)  so we may grow in holiness.\n(1656.48, 1658.48)  We pray to the Lord.\n(1658.48, 1660.48)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1660.48, 1662.48)  For the leaders of all nations,\n(1662.48, 1665.48)  may God grant them wisdom and compassion\n(1665.48, 1668.48)  as they strive to foster peace in our world.\n(1668.48, 1673.08)  to seek justice, dialogue, and reconciliation\n(1673.08, 1675.4)  in all decisions.\n(1675.4, 1677.94)  We especially pray for the leaders involved\n(1677.94, 1681.94)  in the conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine.\n(1681.94, 1683.28)  We pray to the Lord.\n(1683.28, 1685.36)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1685.36, 1687.26)  For those without faith,\n(1687.26, 1689.8)  may the Holy Spirit touch their hearts\n(1689.8, 1691.52)  and guide them to Christ.\n(1691.52, 1692.84)  We pray to the Lord.\n(1692.84, 1695.2)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1695.2, 1698.02)  For the sick and all those who feel burdened\n(1698.02, 1701.14)  by the difficulties they face daily.\n(1701.14, 1703.78)  May God grant them comfort and healing,\n(1703.78, 1705.18)  we pray to the Lord.\n(1705.18, 1707.42)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1707.42, 1710.44)  For those who have died in the light of faith,\n(1710.44, 1715.44)  especially Neil Ryan, Kathleen Ryan, and Catherine Curran,\n(1716.16, 1718.38)  for whom this Mass is offered,\n(1718.38, 1720.74)  and for all of our deceased relatives,\n(1720.74, 1722.98)  friends, and parishioners,\n(1722.98, 1726.54)  may they enjoy a life in communion with the Trinity\n(1726.54, 1732.62)  and all the saints. We pray to the Lord. Lord, hear our prayer. May the silent\n(1732.62, 1738.3)  prayers in our hearts be lifted up to God, who knows our needs even before we\n(1738.3, 1744.54)  ask. We pray to the Lord. Lord, hear our prayer.

whom you had summoned for\n(518.68, 524.74)  in secret the holy children of the good were offering sacrifice and putting into\n(524.74, 532.74)  effect with one accord, the divine\n(547.38, 549.46)  people, he has chosen for his own\n(549.46, 552.26)  inheritance.\n(554.66, 552.26) \n(561.88, 570.6)  See, the eyes of the Lord are upon those who fear Him, upon those who hope for His kindness, to deliver them from death and preserve them in spite of famine.\n(570.6, 574.88)  Our soul waits for the Lord, who is our help and our shield.\n(574.88, 586.48)  May your kindness, O Lord, be upon us who have put our hope in you.\n(586.48, 589.36)  A reading from the letter to the Hebrews.\n(589.36, 596.5)  Sisters and brothers, faith is the realization of what is hoped for and evidence of things\n(596.5, 598.7)  not seen.\n(598.7, 602.52)  Because of it, the ancients were well attested.\n(602.52, 608.56)  By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place that he was to receive\n(608.56, 610.72)  as an inheritance.\n(610.72, 614.86)  He went out, not knowing where he was to go.\n(614.86, 621.58)  By faith he sojourned in the Promised Land as in a foreign country, dwelling in tents\n(621.58, 626.56)  with Isaac and Jacob, heirs of the same promise.\n(626.56, 632.4)  For he was looking forward to the city with foundations, whose architect and maker is\n(632.4, 633.96)  God.\n(633.96, 640.44)  By faith he received the power to generate, even though he was past the normal age.\n(640.44, 643.62)  And Sarah herself was sterile.\n(643.62, 648.0)  For he thought that the one who had made the promise was trustworthy.\n(648.0, 655.72)  So it was that there came forth from one man, himself as good as dead, descendants as numerous\n(655.72, 663.1)  as the stars in the sky and is countless on the sands of the seashore.\n(663.1, 684.42)  The word of the Lord.\n(684.42, 687.3)  The Lord be with you.\n(687.3, 694.74)  A reading from the Holy Gospel according to Luke.\n(694.74, 697.54)  Jesus said to his disciples\n(697.54, 702.38)  Gird your loins and light your lamps, and be like servants who await their\n(702.38, 705.74)  Master's return from a wedding,\n(705.74, 710.4)  ready to open immediately when he comes and knocks.\n(710.4, 713.96)  Blessed are those servants whom the master finds vigilant\n(713.96, 715.96)  on his arrival.\n(715.96, 720.12)  Amen, I say to you, he will gird himself,\n(720.12, 722.36)  have the servants recline at table\n(722.36, 724.84)  and proceed to wait on them.\n(725.76, 728.36)  And should he come in the second or third watch\n(728.36, 731.24)  and find them prepared in this way,\n(731.24, 734.36)  blessed are those servants.\n(734.36, 735.6)  Be sure of this.\n(735.6, 738.6)  If the master of the house had known the hour\n(738.6, 744.96)  when the thief was coming, he would not have let his house be broken into.\n(744.96, 753.36)  You also must be prepared, for in an hour you do not expect, the Son of Man will come.\n(753.36, 763.48)  The Gospel of the Lord.\n(763.48, 769.24)  Gird your loins and light your lamps and be like servants who await their master's return\n(769.24, 775.6)  from a wedding, ready to open immediately when he comes and knocks.\n(775.6, 782.56)  Let's break that open a bit so we can understand what Jesus was speaking about then, two thousand\n(782.56, 789.28)  years ago, and what Jesus is speaking to us today.\n(789.28, 790.28)  Gird your loins.\n(790.28, 797.12)  In that first century world, people wore these long robes that could slow you down if you\n(797.12, 800.86)  needed to work or move quickly.\n(800.86, 808.18)  To gird your loins meant gathering up your robe and tucking it into your belt, basically\n(808.18, 819.42)  rolling up your sleeves in robe form so that you could act quickly and work efficiently.\n(819.42, 826.78)  your lamps. In a time without electricity, having a lamp ready meant you were prepared for the night.\n(827.34, 834.62)  You were alert. You were watching and not cut off guard. And in Jewish imagery,\n(834.62, 839.98)  keeping a lamp burning also symbolized faithfulness and watchfulness.\n(842.22, 848.46)  And then be like servants who await the master's return from a wedding, ready to open immediately\n(848.46, 856.22)  when he comes and knocks, the servants are Jesus' followers, the master represents Jesus\n(856.22, 864.62)  himself, the wedding, a time when Jesus is away, a time before Christ's return, knocking\n(864.62, 873.54)  the moment of Jesus' arrival, whether at the end of one's life or at the final judgment.\n(873.54, 885.76)  The lesson today is that those disciples should live in a constant state of faithful readiness.\n(885.76, 894.4)  Not passively waiting but actively watching so that whenever the Lord returns, whether\n(894.4, 900.28)  expected or sudden, the follower of Christ can open immediately with joy and not with\n(900.28, 906.9)  panic and not with surprise. Jesus uses this image to mean that we should live\n(906.9, 912.64)  in a constant state of readiness for the coming of the Lord and it's not about\n(912.64, 918.48)  it's it's really about being alert not about just waiting around to just be\n(918.48, 924.08)  alert be prepared and equipped spiritually tucked in if you wish so\n(924.08, 930.08)  nothing trips us up when it's time to answer to the Lord. If you've ever been\n(930.08, 936.94)  surprised by an unexpected guest to your house. You know the rush of panic when\n(936.94, 942.62)  that happens. Maybe the scramble to tidy the house up, to put the kettle on, to\n(942.62, 948.74)  make it look like you've been ready all along for them. Jesus is telling us today\n(948.74, 956.5)  don't live like that with your soul. Don't wait for a heavenly doorbell to\n(956.5, 963.04)  start getting ready. And notice that Jesus doesn't say the servants should\n(963.04, 969.6)  wait in fear. We should not be afraid waiting. This is not about living in\n(969.6, 977.96)  paranoia, but in peace. The saint is not the one who waits with a stopwatch, but\n(977.96, 984.92)  the one who lives every day as if it could be the last day. He says we should\n(984.92, 991.12)  be ready to open immediately when the master knocks. And this is a picture of\n(991.12, 996.16)  joyful anticipation, like children waiting for their father to come home,\n(996.16, 1005.12)  not dreading his return. When our hearts are right with God, his coming is not a\n(1005.12, 1012.92)  threat, but the fulfillment of our hope. The master comes not to punish, but to\n(1012.92, 1020.0)  serve. Jesus even says in that gospel today he will gird himself, he will have\n(1020.0, 1026.68)  them recline a table, and he will proceed to wait on us. The judge is also the\n(1026.68, 1033.32)  servant. But the challenge of course is that we don't know the day or the hour\n(1033.32, 1041.04)  of our death, of Christ's return, or of moments when God will call us to act\n(1041.04, 1047.72)  decisively. The unexpectedness is the point of the story. It's meant to keep us\n(1047.72, 1054.8)  from any spiritual laziness. And Jesus is not calling us for a one-time\n(1054.8, 1063.0)  preparation, but rather for a way of life. For Jesus, being prepared is not about\n(1063.0, 1072.32)  predicting dates. It's about living in friendship with him at all times. Some\n(1072.32, 1079.06)  people live as though they have plenty of time to reconcile with God, to forgive\n(1079.06, 1088.7)  someone, to break a destructive habit. But the gospel says otherwise. Be ready now.\n(1088.7, 1098.0)  Holiness is not a project for some day. If Christ called us today, would we be\n(1098.0, 1106.12)  ready? The good news is that readiness is not contemplated, complicated.\n(1106.12, 1114.0)  It's simply walking with Him now. And the Gospel today is not meant to frighten us,\n(1114.0, 1121.92)  but to awaken us. The Lord we wait for is the one who loves us dearly, who laid\n(1121.92, 1130.38)  down his life for us, who will one day welcome us home. So gird your loins, light\n(1130.38, 1138.6)  your lamps, and live in such a way that every day could be the day. Let's live\n(1138.6, 1146.36)  ready not with anxiety but with hearts expectant and lamps burning bright and\n(1146.36, 1154.24)  then whenever he does come we will hear those blessed words well done good and\n(1154.24, 1160.88)  faithful servant enter into the joy of your master\n(1168.6, 1190.4)  We now profess our faith in God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\n(1190.4, 1197.96)  I believe in one God, the Father almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all things visible\n(1197.96, 1205.68)  and invisible. I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, born\n(1205.68, 1213.4)  of the Father before all ages, God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God,\n(1213.4, 1220.12)  begotten not made, consubstantial with the Father. Through him all things were made.\n(1220.12, 1227.16)  For us men and for our salvation he came down from heaven, and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate\n(1227.16, 1234.62)  of the Virgin Mary and became man. For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate,\n(1234.62, 1239.76)  he suffered death and was buried, and rose again on the third day in accordance with\n(1239.76, 1246.56)  the Scriptures. He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father.\n(1246.56, 1251.88)  He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead, and his kingdom will have no\n(1251.88, 1258.88)  end. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from\n(1258.88, 1263.24)  the Father and the Son, who with the Father and the Son is adored and\n(1263.24, 1269.4)  glorified, who has spoken through the prophets. I believe in one holy catholic\n(1269.4, 1275.24)  and apostolic church. I confess one baptism for the forgiveness of sins and\n(1275.24, 1280.04)  I look forward to the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to\n(1280.04, 1287.48)  come, amen. We lift up our needs to the Lord, trusting in his profound love and care for us.\n(1289.0, 1295.48)  For all members of the Church, may the Lord grant us wisdom and humility so that we may grow in\n(1295.48, 1301.88)  holiness. We pray to the Lord. Lord, hear our prayer. For the leaders of all nations,\n(1302.68, 1309.24)  may God grant them wisdom and compassion as they strive to foster peace in our world.\n(1310.04, 1320.04)  May they be inspired by the Holy Spirit to seek justice, dialogue, and reconciliation in all their decisions.\n(1320.04, 1326.04)  We especially pray for the leaders involved in the conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine.\n(1326.04, 1328.04)  We pray to the Lord.\n(1328.04, 1330.04)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1330.04, 1336.04)  For those without faith, may the Holy Spirit touch their hearts and guide them to Christ.\n(1336.04, 1338.04)  We pray to the Lord.\n(1338.04, 1343.8)  Lord, hear our prayer. For the sick and for all those who feel burdened\n(1343.8, 1349.28)  by the difficulties they face daily, may God grant them comfort and healing, we\n(1349.28, 1354.24)  pray to the Lord. Lord, hear our prayer. For those who have died in the light of\n(1354.24, 1360.24)  faith, especially Megan Walsh for whom this Mass is offered, and for all of our\n(1360.24, 1365.1)  deceased relatives, friends, and parishioners, may they enjoy a life in\n(1365.1, 1368.16)  in communion with the Trinity and all the saints,\n(1368.16, 1369.78)  we pray to the Lord.\n(1369.78, 1371.44)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1371.44, 1373.68)  And may the silent prayers in our hearts\n(1373.68, 1375.28)  be lifted up to God.\n(1375.28, 1378.32)  Who knows our needs even before we ask?\n(1381.34, 1382.96)  We pray to the Lord.\n(1382.96, 1385.36)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1385.36, 1387.84)  God, our Father, we join our prayers\n(1387.84, 1390.36)  with those of our brothers and sisters\n(1390.36, 1392.04)  throughout the world,\n(1392.04, 1394.96)  and we make them in confidence in the name of Jesus\n(1394.96, 1399.8)  was Lord forever and ever. Amen.\n(1424.96, 1446.16)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through your goodness we have received\n(1446.16, 1451.12)  the bread we offer you, fruit of the earth and work of human hands, it will become for\n(1451.12, 1458.14)  us the bread of life. Blessed are you Lord God of all creation for through\n(1458.14, 1463.06)  your goodness we have received the wine we offer you fruit of the vine and work\n(1463.06, 1468.38)  of human hands it will become our spiritual drink.\n(1481.12, 1486.4)  Pray, brothers and sisters, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to\n(1486.4, 1489.96)  God the Almighty Father.\n(1496.08, 1501.68)  Be pleased, O Lord, to accept the offerings of your church, for in your\n(1501.68, 1507.12)  mercy you have given them to be offered, and by your power you transform them\n(1507.12, 1513.36)  into the mystery of our salvation through Christ our Lord the Lord be with\n(1513.36, 1522.56)  you lift up your hearts let us give thanks to the Lord our God it is truly\n(1522.56, 1527.9)  right and just our duty and our salvation always and everywhere to give\n(1527.9, 1534.7)  you thanks Lord Holy Father Almighty and Eternal God for we know it belongs to\n(1534.7, 1537.86)  to your boundless glory that you came to the aid\n(1537.86, 1541.42)  of immortal beings with your divinity,\n(1541.42, 1546.36)  and even fashioned for us a remedy out of mortality itself,\n(1546.36, 1549.68)  that the cause of our downfall might become the means\n(1549.68, 1553.24)  of our salvation through Christ our Lord.\n(1553.24, 1556.88)  Through him the host of angels adores your majesty\n(1556.88, 1559.78)  and rejoices in your presence forever.\n(1559.78, 1562.54)  May our voices, we pray, join with theirs\n(1562.54, 1567.38)  in one chorus of exultant praise as we acclaim.\n(1567.38, 1572.14)  Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts,\n(1572.14, 1575.1)  heaven and earth are full of your glory,\n(1575.1, 1577.3)  Hosanna in the highest.\n(1577.3, 1580.86)  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord,\n(1580.86, 1582.74)  Hosanna in the highest.\n(1586.66, 1590.62)  You are indeed holy, O Lord, the fount of all holiness.\n(1590.62, 1593.78)  Make holy, therefore, these gifts, we pray,\n(1593.78, 1597.7)  by sending down your Spirit upon them like the dewfall,\n(1597.7, 1599.7)  so that they may become for us\n(1599.7, 1603.66)  the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.\n(1603.66, 1605.62)  At the time he was betrayed\n(1605.62, 1608.48)  and entered willingly into his passion,\n(1608.48, 1610.94)  he took bread and, giving thanks, broke it\n(1610.94, 1613.74)  and gave it to his disciples, saying,\n(1613.74, 1616.66)  \"'Take this, all of you, and eat of it,\n(1616.66, 1620.58)  For this is my body, which will be given up for you.\n(1629.58, 1633.06)  In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took the chalice,\n(1633.06, 1637.1)  and once more giving thanks, he gave it to his disciples, saying,\n(1637.1, 1639.86)  Take this, all of you, and drink from it.\n(1639.86, 1644.74)  For this is the chalice of my blood, the blood of the new and eternal covenant,\n(1644.74, 1647.14)  which will be poured out for you and for many\n(1647.14, 1649.52)  for the forgiveness of sins.\n(1649.52, 1652.14)  Do this in memory of me.\n(1652.14, 1657.14)  The mystery of faith.\n(1663.62, 1667.26)  When we eat this bread and drink this cup,\n(1667.26, 1671.62)  we proclaim your death, O Lord, until you come again.\n(1671.62, 1674.14)  Therefore, as we celebrate the memorial\n(1674.14, 1680.14)  of his death and resurrection, we offer you, Lord, the bread of life and the chalice of\n(1680.14, 1686.0)  salvation, giving thanks that you have held us worthy to be in your presence and minister\n(1686.0, 1692.3)  to you. Humbly we pray that, partaking of the body and blood of Christ, we may be gathered\n(1692.3, 1699.14)  into one by the Holy Spirit.

Please remember in\n(162.52, 168.76)  your prayers any O'Connell for whom this mass is offered and for all our\n(168.76, 174.64)  deceased relatives, friends, and parishioners. We do not pass the\n(174.64, 180.04)  collection basket. Instead we ask that you place your weekly offering into the\n(180.04, 185.6)  donation boxes at the doors of the church.

Have mercy on us.\n(463.3, 473.3)  You'll take away the sins of the world. Receive our praise.\n(473.3, 481.3)  You are seated on the right hand arm of the Lamb,\n(481.3, 488.3)  ever so we are blessed.\n(488.3, 492.3)  For I, who alone are the Holy One,\n(492.3, 496.3)  who alone are the Lord,\n(496.3, 501.3)  who alone are the most high,\n(501.3, 515.78)  Jesus Christ with the Holy Spirit in the glory of God the Father. Amen.\n(516.66, 524.42)  Let us pray. Almighty ever-living God, whom taught by the Holy Spirit we dare to call our Father,\n(525.06, 530.98)  bring we pray to perfection in our hearts the spirit of adoption as your sons and daughters,\n(530.98, 536.74)  that we may merit to enter into the inheritance which you have promised you are lord jesus christ\n(536.74, 542.42)  your son who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the holy spirit god forever and ever\n(552.5, 554.5)  a reading from the book of wisdom\n(556.1, 554.5) \n(564.26, 570.58)  The night of the Passover was known beforehand to our fathers, that with short knowledge of the oaths in which they put their faith, they might have courage.\n(570.58, 578.98)  Your people awaited the salvation of the just and the destruction of their foes.\n(578.98, 588.16)  For when you punished our adversaries, in this you glorified us, whom you had summoned.\n(588.16, 597.3)  For in secret the holy children of the good were offering sacrifice and putting into effect,\n(597.3, 602.56)  with one accord, the divine institution.\"\n(602.56, 604.56)  The Word of the Lord.\n(608.98, 633.14)  blessed the people the lord has chosen chosen to be\n(633.14, 646.14)  Blessed are the people the Lord has chosen, chosen to be his own.\n(646.14, 654.14)  Exalt you just in the Lord, praise from the upright his feeding.\n(654.14, 659.14)  Blessed the nation whose God is the Lord,\n(659.14, 666.34)  the people he has chosen for his own inheritance.\n(666.34, 676.34)  Blessed the people the Lord has chosen, chosen to be his own.\n(676.34, 683.14)  See, the eyes of the Lord are upon those who feel him,\n(683.14, 688.34)  upon those who hope for his kindness,\n(688.34, 698.3)  to deliver them from death and preserve them in spite of famine.\n(698.3, 708.94)  Blessed are people who are thus chosen, chosen to be his own.\n(708.94, 717.9)  Our soul waits for the Lord, who is our help and our shield.\n(717.9, 729.1)  May your kindness, O Lord, be upon us who have put our hope in you.\n(729.1, 739.82)  Blessed are the people the Lord has chosen, chosen to be his own.\n(747.9, 755.96)  A reading from a letter to the Hebrews.\n(755.96, 765.8)  Brothers and sisters, faith is the realization of what is hoped for, an evidence of things\n(765.8, 768.58)  not seen.\n(768.58, 773.42)  Because of it, the ancients were well attested.\n(773.42, 782.86)  By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place that he was to receive\n(782.86, 785.52)  as an inheritance.\n(785.52, 791.7)  He went out, not knowing where he was to go.\n(791.7, 800.4)  By faith he sojourned to the Promised Land as in a foreign country, dwelling in tents\n(800.4, 805.4)  with Isaac and Jacob, heirs of the same promise.\n(806.52, 811.52)  For he was looking forward to the city with foundations,\n(811.72, 815.6)  whose architect and maker is God.\n(816.82, 821.38)  By faith, he received power to generate,\n(821.38, 825.9)  even though he was past the normal age,\n(825.9, 828.82)  and Sarah herself was sterile.\n(829.7, 828.82) \n(836.74, 847.84)  For he thought that the one who had made the promise was trustworthy. So it was that there came forth from one man himself as good as dead, descendants as numerous\n(847.84, 855.7)  as the stars in the sky, and as countless as the sands on the seashore.\n(855.7, 859.38)  All these died in faith.\n(859.38, 867.78)  They did not receive what had been promised, but saw it and greeted it from afar, and acknowledged\n(867.78, 873.14)  themselves to be strangers and aliens on earth.\n(873.14, 880.8)  For those who speak thus show that they are seeking a homeland.\n(880.8, 887.3)  If they had been thinking of the land from which they had come, they would have had the\n(887.3, 897.3)  opportunity to return, but now they desire a better homeland, a heavenly one.\n(897.3, 907.34)  Therefore, God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for\n(907.34, 908.34)  them.\n(908.34, 919.36)  By faith, when put to the test, offered up Isaac, and he who received the promises was\n(919.36, 929.56)  ready to offer his only son, of whom it is said, Through Isaac descendants shall bear\n(929.56, 932.08)  your name.\n(932.08, 941.08)  He reasoned that God was able to raise, even from the dead, and he received back Isaac\n(941.08, 944.36)  as a symbol.\n(944.36, 949.36)  The word of the Lord.\n(949.36, 974.36)  Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah.\n(974.36, 987.24)  Stay awake and be ready, for you do not know on what day your Lord will come.\n(987.24, 997.32)  Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.\n(997.32, 1004.04)  The Lord be with you. A reading from the Holy Gospel according to Luke.\n(1004.36, 1010.12)  Jesus said to his disciples do not be afraid any longer little flock for your\n(1010.12, 1013.96)  father is pleased to give you the kingdom sell your belongings and give\n(1013.96, 1019.96)  alms provide money bags for yourselves that do not wear out an inexhaustible\n(1019.96, 1025.12)  treasure in heaven that no thief can reach nor moth destroy for where your\n(1025.12, 1030.08)  treasure is there also will your heartbeat gird your loins and light your\n(1030.08, 1034.04)  lamps and be like servants who await their master's return from a wedding,\n(1034.04, 1039.24)  ready to open immediately when he comes and knocks. Blessed are those servants\n(1039.24, 1044.56)  whom the master finds vigilant on his arrival. Amen, I say to you, he will gird\n(1044.56, 1049.2)  himself, have them recline at table and proceed to wait on them. And should he\n(1049.2, 1054.08)  come in the second or third watch and find them prepared in this way, blessed\n(1054.08, 1059.32)  are those servants. Be sure of this. If the master of the house had known the\n(1059.32, 1063.8)  hour when the thief was coming, he would not have let his house be broken into.\n(1063.8, 1068.84)  You also must be prepared, for an hour you do not expect the Son of Man will\n(1068.84, 1074.8)  come. Then Peter said, Lord, is this parable meant for us or for everyone? And\n(1074.8, 1079.96)  the Lord replied, Who then is the faithful and prudent steward, whom the\n(1079.96, 1083.08)  master will put in charge of his servants to distribute the food\n(1083.08, 1088.08)  allowance at the proper time? Blessed is that servant whom his master on arrival\n(1088.08, 1093.6)  finds doing so. Truly I say to you, the master will put the servant in charge of\n(1093.6, 1098.86)  all his property, but if that servant says to himself, my master is delayed in\n(1098.86, 1103.44)  coming and begins to beat the men servants and the maid servants to eat\n(1103.44, 1107.28)  and drink and get drunk, then that servant's master will come on an\n(1107.28, 1111.68)  unexpected day and an unknown hour and will punish the servant severely and\n(1111.68, 1116.6)  assign him a place with the unfaithful. That servant who knew his master's will\n(1116.6, 1121.36)  but did not make preparations, nor act in accord with his will, shall be beaten\n(1121.36, 1126.32)  severely. And the servant who is ignorant of his master's will, but acted in a way\n(1126.32, 1131.96)  deserving of a severe beating, shall be beaten only lightly. Much will be\n(1131.96, 1136.72)  required of the person entrusted with much, and still more will be demanded of\n(1136.72, 1142.6)  the person entrusted with more. The Gospel of the Lord.\n(1146.6, 1153.14)  when you study to become a priest you spend your summers in a parish shadowing different priests because\n(1153.32, 1159.36)  Much like any other profession. You can't really learn how to do this until you get some hand-on experience\n(1159.8, 1164.32)  Hands-on experience and so my very first summer in the seminary\n(1164.32, 1170.26)  I went to a parish down in the South Shore and I shadowed this wonderful priest and I will never forget the\n(1170.48, 1175.44)  experience that I had when I went to my very first wake as a seminarian and\n(1175.72, 1175.44) \n(1181.44, 1190.44)  And this was a very unusual wake because it was for a police officer who died in line of duty. And so, since it was a massive wake, he was waked out of the church, and the Cardinal came to say the prayers.\n(1190.44, 1195.44)  And as the grieving family was sitting there, and what do you even say,\n(1195.44, 1201.44)  the Cardinal stood up and he opened the prayer book, which now I have said hundreds of times,\n(1201.44, 1206.44)  and he read these words, which we heard from our gospel.\n(1207.44, 1209.02)  Be sure of this.\n(1209.96, 1213.36)  If the master of the house had known the hour\n(1213.36, 1215.52)  when the thief was coming,\n(1215.52, 1218.22)  he would not have let his house be broken into.\n(1219.24, 1221.76)  You too must be prepared,\n(1221.76, 1223.84)  because in an hour you do not expect\n(1223.84, 1225.24)  the Son of Man will come.\n(1227.22, 1231.04)  I'll never forget standing there, and I was angry,\n(1231.04, 1236.04)  when I heard those words because everyone was crying\n(1237.96, 1242.22)  and I thought of all the things in the gospel,\n(1243.28, 1247.72)  why does the church ask this to be read?\n(1249.76, 1254.22)  You do not know the hour in which the Son of Man will come.\n(1256.0, 1258.82)  Not exactly the most comforting words\n(1258.82, 1260.72)  to hear when you suffer loss.\n(1262.64, 1264.6)  But upon further reflection,\n(1265.48, 1270.22)  the reason the church asks this gospel to be read at a wake\n(1271.06, 1272.94)  is for a very obvious reason.\n(1274.7, 1279.3)  Though we don't like to think about it, all of us die.\n(1280.34, 1283.2)  In every single moment of our lives,\n(1283.2, 1285.86)  God in his infinite goodness and love\n(1285.86, 1289.5)  is drawing close to us and begging us\n(1289.5, 1291.66)  to have a deeper conversion,\n(1291.66, 1293.84)  to love him and our neighbor more.\n(1293.84, 1296.78)  And every moment he's sending that invitation.\n(1298.0, 1298.84)  But,\n(1301.2, 1305.74)  when we die, the state of our soul is final.\n(1308.38, 1313.38)  And so, this gospel, as Jesus says,\n(1313.66, 1313.38) \n(1322.18, 1329.18)  encourages us, begs us to make our conversion the top priority of our lives. Every time we have an experience with death, we stare our contingency, our\n(1329.18, 1338.66)  weakness, our finality right in the face, and we realize we don't have as much\n(1338.66, 1345.86)  time as we think and so that's why Jesus says we need to be vigilant the\n(1345.86, 1351.1)  disciple the one who follows him in love is prayerfully watching is standing at\n(1351.1, 1358.78)  the ready this my brothers and sisters is the most important question we can\n(1358.78, 1367.22)  ask ourselves is where is the state of my soul where do I stand before God so\n(1367.22, 1371.92)  So often, I know for me, I can put these things off.\n(1371.92, 1373.78)  I can say things, you know what?\n(1373.78, 1375.7)  I'm really tired today.\n(1376.92, 1378.5)  I'm not gonna pray.\n(1380.14, 1383.14)  I can get to the Bible tomorrow.\n(1383.14, 1386.48)  That family member who I should forgive,\n(1387.66, 1391.52)  but no, I wanna hold onto it, and I have time.\n(1391.52, 1393.86)  Something I often hear too from young people is,\n(1393.86, 1395.62)  well Father, when I get married,\n(1395.62, 1401.38)  Maybe when I have a family, then I'll start going back to church.\n(1401.38, 1407.4)  Then maybe I'll get my marriage invalidated in the church.\n(1407.4, 1413.86)  This question of where we stand before God is urging.\n(1413.86, 1417.26)  The Lord wants us to be ready.\n(1417.26, 1418.26)  How do we know?\n(1418.26, 1420.3)  How do we begin to examine ourselves?\n(1420.3, 1425.58)  Well, Jesus says too at the start of this Gospel, it's a simple question, where is your\n(1425.58, 1433.68)  treasure. Where is your treasure? Because there also will your heart be. It's\n(1433.68, 1437.32)  really simple. We can ask what is it what's the most important thing in my\n(1437.32, 1444.2)  life? What do I spend most of my time thinking about or trying to achieve? And\n(1444.2, 1449.96)  a lot of the times those things are really good things and they absolutely\n(1449.96, 1457.8)  should be a big part of our lives. But if they replace God, if we start to worship\n(1457.8, 1465.2)  those things, we're not ready to meet the Lord. St. Augustine, who's one of our\n(1465.2, 1470.68)  patrons of this city and whose feast we celebrate at the end of the month, he put\n(1470.68, 1475.22)  this same question, where's your treasure, there will your heart be, so beautifully\n(1475.22, 1480.18)  in one of this great works he wrote he calls it the city of God and he said\n(1480.18, 1486.26)  we're either in two camps we're in the city of man we love everything here on\n(1486.26, 1492.78)  earth or we're in the city of God we asked God's will to be done in our life\n(1492.78, 1498.66)  above everything else like Abraham from our second reading going out into the\n(1498.66, 1509.5)  deep, following the Lord at his command. What city are we in? Once we take\n(1509.5, 1517.5)  inventory of this question, we have to put things into action. That's what it\n(1517.5, 1523.02)  means to be vigilant and ready. May the grace of this mass, especially the Our\n(1523.02, 1528.5)  Father, which asks us to pray for our daily bread, to be ready right here and\n(1528.5, 1533.5)  And right now, help us to see that we're blessed,\n(1533.98, 1537.62)  or as the Lord says, happy, when we stand vigilant.\n(1537.62, 1539.7)  And there is peace and freedom,\n(1539.7, 1541.58)  and then we have nothing to fear,\n(1541.58, 1544.98)  because we are all members of God's flock.\n(1544.98, 1547.66)  And he wants us to be ready to receive that\n(1547.66, 1549.56)  whenever he calls.\n(1558.5, 1566.66)  And so let us stand and profess our faith.\n(1566.66, 1572.84)  I believe in one God, the Father almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all things visible\n(1572.84, 1574.34)  and invisible.\n(1574.34, 1580.2)  I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, born of the Father before\n(1580.2, 1586.5)  all ages, God from God, light from light, true God from true God, begotten not made\n(1586.5, 1591.0)  unsubstantial with the Father. Through him all things were made. For us men and\n(1591.0, 1595.16)  for our salvation he came down from heaven and by the Holy Spirit was\n(1595.16, 1599.8)  incarnate of the Virgin Mary and became man. For our sake he was crucified under\n(1599.8, 1604.4)  Pontius Pilate. He suffered death and was buried and rose again on the third day\n(1604.4, 1608.46)  in accordance with the scriptures. He ascended into heaven and is seated at\n(1608.46, 1612.08)  the right hand of the Father. He will come again in glory to judge the living\n(1612.08, 1618.32)  the dead and his kingdom will have no end. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,\n(1618.32, 1623.6)  who proceeds from the Father and the Son, who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified,\n(1623.6, 1630.24)  who has spoken through the prophets. I believe in one holy catholic and apostolic church. I confess\n(1630.24, 1635.36)  one baptism for the forgiveness of sins and I look forward to the resurrection of the dead\n(1635.36, 1641.28)  and the life of the world to come. Amen. Turning towards our Heavenly Father with great confidence,\n(1641.28, 1651.36)  we make our petitions known to him for all members of the church may the lord grant us\n(1651.36, 1660.32)  wisdom and humility so we may grow in holiness we pray to the lord lord hear our prayer for the\n(1660.32, 1668.16)  leaders of all nations may god grant them wisdom and compassion as they strive to foster peace in\n(1668.16, 1677.32)  our world, may they be inspired by the Holy Spirit to seek justice, dialogue, and reconciliation\n(1677.32, 1679.78)  in all their decisions.\n(1679.78, 1687.44)  We especially pray for the leaders involved in the conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine.\n(1687.44, 1689.0)  We pray to the Lord.\n(1689.0, 1691.2)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1691.2, 1700.32)  For those without faith, may the Holy Spirit touch their hearts and guide them to Christ.\n(1700.32, 1704.28)  We pray to the Lord, Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1704.28, 1711.56)  For the sick and all those who feel burdened by the difficulties they face daily, may God\n(1711.56, 1714.76)  grant them comfort and healing.\n(1714.76, 1718.44)  We pray to the Lord, Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1718.44, 1722.28)  For those who have died in the light of faith,\n(1722.28, 1725.88)  especially Annie O'Connell,\n(1725.88, 1728.32)  for whom this Mass is offered,\n(1728.32, 1733.32)  and for all our friends, relatives, and parishioners,\n(1733.32, 1735.92)  may they enjoy a life in communion\n(1735.92, 1739.72)  with the Trinity and all the saints.\n(1739.72, 1741.4)  We pray to the Lord.\n(1741.4, 1743.32)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1743.32, 1746.48)  May the silent prayers in our hearts\n(1746.48, 1751.48)  be lifted up to God, who knows our needs even before we ask.\n(1754.74, 1756.62)  We pray to the Lord.\n(1756.62, 1758.42)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1759.42, 1762.54)  Heavenly Father, we make these prayers with great confidence\n(1762.54, 1764.7)  as we ask them through the intercession of Mary,\n(1764.7, 1766.42)  our morning star in gate of heaven,\n(1766.42, 1768.86)  and we speak them in the name of Jesus, her son,\n(1768.86, 1770.7)  who is Lord forever and ever.\n(1770.7, 1771.54)  Amen.\n(1773.14, 1771.54) \n(1778.54, 1801.54)  Please join in singing number 563, Be Not Afraid, number 563.\n(1819.86, 1835.38)  We shall speak your words in foreign language, and no one will understand. You shall see the face of God and live in water through you.\n(1835.38, 1850.5)  I go before you always, come for me, and I will be the rest.\n(1855.78, 1850.5) \n(1865.5, 1874.5)  If you pass through raging waters, in the sea there shall not drown. If you walk amid the burning plains, there shall not be harm.\n(1874.5, 1884.5)  If you stand before the poor of hell, and God is at your side,\n(1884.5, 1894.0)  Oh, that I am with you in law.\n(1894.0, 1920.32)  I pray, brothers and sisters, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God, the Almighty\n(1920.32, 1921.32)  Father.\n(1921.32, 1922.32)  Amen.\n(1922.32, 1923.32)  Amen.\n(1923.32, 1933.68)  Be pleased, O Lord, to accept the offerings of your church, for in your mercy you have\n(1933.68, 1938.62)  given them to be offered, and by your power you transform them into the mystery of our\n(1938.62, 1942.4)  salvation, through Christ our Lord.\n(1942.4, 1944.0)  The Lord be with you.\n(1944.0, 1947.44)  Lift up your hearts.\n(1947.44, 1951.4)  Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.\n(1951.4, 1954.62)  It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,\n(1954.62, 1957.04)  always and everywhere to give you thanks.\n(1957.04, 1959.2)  Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God,\n(1959.2, 1960.64)  through Christ our Lord.\n(1960.64, 1962.36)  For through his paschal mystery,\n(1962.36, 1964.32)  he accomplished the marvelous deed\n(1964.32, 1967.28)  by which he has freed us from the yoke of sin and death,\n(1967.28, 1969.96)  summoning us to the glory of being now called,\n(1969.96, 1973.64)  a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation,\n(1973.64, 1975.64)  a people for your own possession,\n(1975.64, 1978.08)  to proclaim everywhere your mighty words,\n(1978.08, 1980.04)  for you have called us out of darkness\n(1980.04, 1981.88)  and to your own wonderful life.\n(1981.88, 1984.0)  And so with angels and archangels,\n(1984.0, 1985.76)  with thrones and dominions,\n(1985.76, 1988.28)  and with all the hosts and powers of heaven,\n(1988.28, 1990.04)  we sing the hymn of your glory,\n(1990.04, 1991.8)  as without end we acclaim.\n(1991.8, 2004.8)  L. E. Holy, holy, Lord God of hosts,\n(2004.8, 2012.8)  F. and M. S. are full of your glory,\n(2012.8, 2022.3)  Hosanna in the highest, hosanna in the highest.\n(2022.3, 2030.8)  Blessed is he, Lord God, in the name of the Lord.\n(2030.8, 2041.3)  Hosanna in the highest, hosanna in the highest.\n(2042.8, 2047.64)  You are indeed holy, O Lord, and all you have created rightly gives you praise.\n(2047.64, 2052.36)  For through your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, by the power and working of the\n(2052.36, 2056.96)  Holy Spirit, you give life to all things and make them holy, and you never cease\n(2056.96, 2061.48)  to gather a people to yourself, so that from the rising of the sun to its setting,\n(2061.48, 2067.6)  a pure sacrifice may be offered to your name. Therefore, O Lord, we humbly implore\n(2067.6, 2071.68)  you, by the same Spirit graciously make holy these gifts we have brought to you\n(2071.68, 2077.12)  for consecration that they may become the body and blood of your son our Lord\n(2077.12, 2082.32)  Jesus Christ at whose command we celebrate these mysteries for on the\n(2082.32, 2088.04)  night he was betrayed he himself took breath and giving you thanks he said the\n(2088.04, 2095.6)  blessing broke the bread and gave it to his disciples saying take this all of\n(2095.6, 2105.32)  and eat of it, for this is my body, which will be given up for you.\"\n(2117.32, 2123.88)  In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took the challenge, and giving you\n(2123.88, 2130.72)  thanks he said the blessed and gave the chalice to his disciples say take this\n(2130.72, 2138.8)  all of you and drink from it for this is the chalice of my blood the blood of the\n(2138.8, 2143.44)  new and eternal covenant which will be poured out for you and for many for the\n(2143.44, 2149.64)  forgiveness of sins do this in memory of me\n(2153.88, 2178.88)  The Mystery of Faith When we eat this bread, and drink this wine,\n(2178.88, 2188.88)  We proclaim your death, O Lord, until you come again.\n(2188.88, 2192.64)  Therefore, O Lord, as we celebrate the memorial of the saving passion of your\n(2192.64, 2195.76)  son, his wondrous resurrection and ascension into heaven,\n(2195.76, 2199.68)  and as we look forward to his second coming, we offer you in thanksgiving this\n(2199.68, 2203.52)  holy and living sacrifice. Look, we pray, upon the oblation of your\n(2203.52, 2207.68)  church, in recognizing the sacrificial victim by whose death you willed to\n(2207.68, 2209.76)  to reconcile us to yourself,\n(2209.76, 2211.2)  grant that we who are nourished\n(2211.2, 2213.28)  by the body and blood of your Son,\n(2213.28, 2214.72)  and filled with his Holy Spirit,\n(2214.72, 2217.68)  may become one body, one spirit in Christ.\n(2217.68, 2220.28)  May he make of us an eternal offering to you,\n(2220.28, 2223.0)  so that we may obtain an inheritance with your elect,\n(2223.0, 2226.32)  especially with the most blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God,\n(2226.32, 2228.28)  with blessed Joseph, her spouse,\n(2228.28, 2230.58)  with your blessed apostles and glorious martyrs,\n(2230.58, 2233.2)  with Saint Lawrence, and with all the saints,\n(2233.2, 2235.6)  on whose constant intercession in your presence,\n(2235.6, 2237.7)  you rely for unfailing help.\n(2237.7, 2241.26)  May this sacrifice of our reconciliation, we pray, O Lord,\n(2241.26, 2244.22)  advance the peace and salvation of all the world.\n(2244.22, 2246.14)  Be pleased to confirm in faith and charity\n(2246.14, 2247.58)  your pilgrim church on earth,\n(2247.58, 2251.14)  with your servant, Leo, our pope, and Richard, our bishop,\n(2251.14, 2253.42)  the order of bishops, all the clergy,\n(2253.42, 2256.14)  and the entire people you have gained for your own.\n(2256.14, 2259.34)  Listen graciously to the prayers of this family,\n(2259.34, 2261.14)  whom you have summoned before you.\n(2261.14, 2263.58)  In your compassion, O merciful Father,\n(2263.58, 2265.46)  gather to yourself all your children,\n(2265.46, 2267.26)  scattered throughout the world.\n(2267.26, 2269.52)  To our departed brothers and sisters,\n(2269.52, 2270.94)  and to all who are pleasing to you\n(2270.94, 2272.92)  at their passing from this life,\n(2272.92, 2274.9)  give kind admittance to your kingdom.\n(2274.9, 2277.98)  There we hope to enjoy forever the fullness of your glory,\n(2277.98, 2279.48)  through Christ our Lord,\n(2279.48, 2282.32)  through whom you bestow on the world all that is good.\n(2288.7, 2293.08)  Through him and with him and in him,\n(2293.08, 2300.88)  O God, almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\n(2300.88, 2308.88)  all glory and honor is yours forever and ever.\n(2308.88, 2332.16)  The Savior's command, informed by divine teaching, we dare to say, Our Father, who art in heaven,\n(2332.16, 2333.88)  hallowed be thy name.\n(2333.88, 2338.86)  Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.\n(2338.86, 2345.82)  us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass\n(2345.82, 2352.86)  against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil deliver us lord we pray from\n(2352.86, 2358.14)  every evil graciously grant peace in our days that by the help of your mercy we may be always\n(2358.14, 2364.06)  free from sin and safe from all distress as we await the blessed hope and the coming of our savior\n(2364.06, 2372.8)  Jesus Christ Lord Jesus Christ who said to your apostles peace I leave you my\n(2372.8, 2376.46)  peace I give you look not in our sins but on the faith of your church and\n(2376.46, 2380.5)  graciously grant your peace and unity in accordance with your will who live and\n(2380.5, 2385.74)  reign forever and ever the peace of the Lord be with you always let us offer\n(2385.74, 2388.94)  each other the sign of peace\n(2394.06, 2413.82)  Let the Lord take away the sins of the world,\n(2413.82, 2417.82)  Have mercy on us,\n(2417.82, 2420.82)  Heaven and Earth,\n(2420.82, 2425.82)  Who take away the sins of the world,\n(2425.82, 2429.82)  Have mercy on

He went out, not knowing where he was to go. By faith he sojourned\n(765.56, 773.04)  in the promised land as in a foreign country, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, heirs\n(773.04, 780.52)  of the same promise, for he was looking forward to the city with foundations whose architect\n(780.52, 784.24)  and maker is God.\n(784.24, 791.48)  By faith he received power to generate, even though he was past the normal age, and Sarah\n(791.48, 799.54)  herself was sterile, for he thought that the one who had made the promise was trustworthy.\n(799.54, 807.28)  So it was that there came forth from one man himself as good as dead, descendants as numerous\n(807.28, 809.94)  as the stars in the sky,\n(809.94, 813.22)  and as countless as the sands on the seashore.\n(814.62, 815.96)  The word of the Lord.\n(819.96, 824.96)  [\"Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia\"]\n(837.28, 839.7)  Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.\n(843.98, 845.98)  Stay awake and be ready.\n(848.58, 852.92)  For you do not know on what day your Lord will come.\n(856.56, 858.98)  Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.\n(866.6, 858.98) \n(860.9, 866.4)  Hallelujah, hallelujah.\n(867.72, 868.88)  The Lord be with you.\n(871.64, 873.88)  A reading from the Holy Gospel according to Luke.\n(876.36, 879.4)  Jesus said to his disciples, do not be afraid any longer, little flock,\n(879.4, 882.76)  for your father is pleased to give you the kingdom.\n(882.76, 885.4)  Sell your belongings and give alms.\n(885.4, 888.4)  Provide money for yourselves that you do,\n(888.4, 891.88)  Provide money bags for yourselves that do not wear out,\n(891.88, 894.22)  and inexhaustible treasure in heaven\n(894.22, 897.84)  that no thief can reach nor moth destroy.\n(897.84, 901.52)  For where your treasure is, there also your heart will be.\n(902.48, 905.32)  Gird your loins and light your lamps,\n(905.32, 908.28)  and be like servants who await their master's return\n(908.28, 911.24)  from a wedding, ready to open immediately\n(911.24, 912.88)  when he comes and knocks.\n(913.8, 917.42)  Blessed are those servants whom the master finds vigilant\n(917.42, 919.38)  on his arrival.\n(919.38, 922.94)  Amen, I say to you, he will gird himself,\n(922.94, 927.82)  have them recline at table, and proceed to wait on them.\n(927.82, 930.7)  And should he come in the second or third watch\n(930.7, 933.32)  and find them prepared in this way,\n(933.32, 935.18)  blessed are these servants.\n(936.02, 939.42)  Be sure of this, if the master of the house\n(939.42, 942.1)  had known the hour when the thief was coming,\n(942.1, 945.9)  he would not have let his house be broken into.\n(945.9, 948.5)  you also must be prepared,\n(948.5, 950.82)  for at an hour you do not expect,\n(950.82, 952.58)  the Son of Man will come.\n(954.06, 955.58)  Then Peter said,\n(955.58, 959.9)  Lord, is this parable meant for us or for everyone?\n(959.9, 961.92)  And the Lord replied,\n(961.92, 965.08)  who then is the faithful and prudent steward\n(965.08, 968.54)  whom the master will put in charge of his servants\n(968.54, 971.64)  to distribute the food allowance at the proper time?\n(972.74, 974.38)  Blessed is that servant\n(974.38, 977.68)  whom his master on arrival finds doing so.\n(979.08, 982.76)  Truly, I say to you, the master will put the servant\n(982.76, 984.84)  in charge of all his property.\n(986.22, 989.72)  But if that servant says to himself,\n(989.72, 992.44)  my master is delayed in coming,\n(992.44, 995.64)  and begins to beat the men servants and the maid servants\n(995.64, 999.0)  to eat and drink and get drunk,\n(999.0, 1003.62)  then that servant's master will come at an unexpected day,\n(1003.62, 1008.32)  at an unknown hour, and will punish the servant severely,\n(1008.32, 1011.0)  and assign him a place with the unfaithful.\n(1012.18, 1015.26)  That servant who knew his master's will,\n(1015.26, 1018.38)  but did not make preparations nor act in accord\n(1018.38, 1021.94)  with his will, shall be beaten severely.\n(1021.94, 1024.98)  And the servant who was ignorant of the master's will,\n(1024.98, 1028.4)  but acted in a way deserving of severe beating,\n(1028.4, 1030.38)  shall be beaten only lightly.\n(1031.46, 1030.38) \n(1037.66, 1043.0)  Much will be required of the person entrusted with much, and still more will be demanded of the person entrusted with more.\n(1043.0, 1051.7)  The Gospel of the Lord.\n(1051.7, 1058.94)  My friends, the Gospel we have just heard is too cold, it's too harsh for a warm sunny\n(1058.94, 1060.84)  summer day.\n(1060.84, 1065.88)  It speaks about death and our readiness to meet the Lord when he comes.\n(1065.88, 1070.44)  It's got more of a November chill than an August glow.\n(1070.44, 1075.28)  And I could have read the shorter version, I read it all, because perhaps the Lord God\n(1075.28, 1079.16)  is trying to say something to us through it all.\n(1079.16, 1085.58)  The message from the readings today is to be ever-ready Christians.\n(1085.58, 1089.3)  Always alert, always prepared.\n(1089.3, 1092.82)  Death is something that faces all of us.\n(1092.82, 1098.62)  Human death, your death and mine, is different from an animal's death.\n(1098.62, 1103.82)  While plants and animals perish, only humans die.\n(1103.82, 1108.1)  Death is not something that just happens us from the outside.\n(1108.1, 1115.02)  It is something for which we prepare ourselves, our minds, our hearts, our lives.\n(1115.02, 1117.5)  Death is inevitable.\n(1117.5, 1124.58)  We must learn to accept that death as a must, must become death as a want.\n(1124.58, 1130.7)  It's not that we are dying to die, but we must look to look at it as a reality.\n(1130.7, 1134.82)  Look at it as a reality that we all must face.\n(1134.82, 1137.14)  I did warn you, didn't I?\n(1137.14, 1140.14)  Anyway, to whom shall we look for help?\n(1140.14, 1142.42)  We look to Jesus, of course.\n(1142.42, 1146.3)  He didn't look forward to death any more than we do.\n(1146.3, 1152.86)  The prospect of crucifixion truly terrified him, and in the Garden of Gethsemane he sweated\n(1152.86, 1159.06)  blood and prayed that if it were possible, this cup would pass him by.\n(1159.06, 1166.78)  And nevertheless, his dying was an act of supreme human trust in his God and Father.\n(1166.78, 1170.34)  Let it be according to your will.\n(1170.34, 1173.42)  into your hands, I commend my spirit.\n(1175.26, 1178.92)  Viktor Frankl was an Austrian psychiatrist,\n(1178.92, 1181.22)  philosopher, and writer.\n(1181.22, 1184.56)  He also was a Jewish Holocaust survivor.\n(1185.78, 1190.56)  His most famous book is Man's Search for Meaning,\n(1190.56, 1192.78)  and it is an account of what he learned\n(1192.78, 1197.38)  about human nature in the Nazi concentration camp.\n(1197.38, 1201.54)  In it, he notes that the people most likely to survive\n(1202.58, 1206.94)  were those who had something to look forward to,\n(1206.94, 1210.82)  a loved one with whom they hoped to be reunited,\n(1210.82, 1213.74)  an enterprise they hoped to finish,\n(1214.94, 1219.22)  a place they hoped to visit when freedom would come.\n(1219.22, 1222.82)  Looking forward with hope helped them to live\n(1222.82, 1225.16)  the cruel and dismal future.\n(1227.14, 1225.16) \n(1232.38, 1239.42)  What we look forward to is deeply a part of our personality. It influences our mental and spiritual state and this, in turn, has an impact on our health\n(1239.42, 1241.92)  and our vitality.\n(1241.92, 1249.08)  The lack of something to look forward to depletes our energy and inhibits our performance.\n(1249.08, 1257.56)  I don't know about you, but I am at my most productive in the period before I go on vacation.\n(1257.56, 1263.66)  Looking forward to the free time focuses my mind, and things that have been lying in the\n(1263.66, 1268.84)  in-tray forever are quickly taken care of.\n(1268.84, 1271.68)  Maybe I should go away more often.\n(1271.68, 1274.8)  Don't tell Father Casey I said that.\n(1274.8, 1281.44)  I am always amazed that in surveys there's a percentage, a high percentage of practicing\n(1281.44, 1287.96)  Catholics and Christians who say that they believe in God, they believe in Jesus Christ\n(1287.96, 1292.96)  but they don't believe in life after death.\n(1292.96, 1297.02)  That makes absolutely no sense.\n(1297.02, 1303.66)  That Jesus rose from the dead and that we are called to share eternal life with him\n(1303.66, 1307.34)  is the core of our faith.\n(1307.34, 1311.6)  Resurrection is the content and motive of Christian faith.\n(1311.6, 1317.28)  And if you don't believe that, you should skip church, you should go down to Castle\n(1317.28, 1322.88)  Island for a walk, or you should stay in bed on a Sunday morning.\n(1322.88, 1330.9)  I repeat, resurrection is the content and motive of Christian faith.\n(1330.9, 1335.14)  Present and future must be held together.\n(1335.14, 1341.14)  Hope in eternal life adds value to the way that we live now.\n(1341.14, 1349.98)  The future fact of eternal life with God calls us right back to the realities and responsibilities\n(1349.98, 1353.28)  of this present life.\n(1353.28, 1358.44)  and future, yes, they must be held together.\n(1358.44, 1364.5)  And this Sunday's readings awaken us to that fact.\n(1364.5, 1371.32)  How do we prepare for death except by responding fully to the present?\n(1371.32, 1376.5)  Christ constantly comes in our lives, not just at the end.\n(1376.5, 1383.24)  He constantly comes in our lives, in the sick, in the poor, in the people with whom we share\n(1383.24, 1388.24)  we share love with those who are distant and need our help.\n(1389.24, 1392.8)  Christ comes in the words of the poet\n(1392.8, 1395.76)  in the bits and pieces of every day.\n(1396.74, 1400.1)  A faithful Christian life in this world\n(1400.1, 1402.82)  is the best preparation for the next.\n(1404.32, 1407.36)  So the gospel today had two parables.\n(1407.36, 1410.6)  The first story highlights the unpredictability\n(1410.6, 1413.98)  of the future and the moment of justice.\n(1413.98, 1418.66)  You must be prepared, for at an hour you do not expect,\n(1418.66, 1420.72)  the Son of Man will come.\n(1421.88, 1426.76)  It reminds us now to keep an eye on the future.\n(1426.76, 1429.66)  We do not know when our lives will end\n(1429.66, 1432.4)  and when we will come face to face with God.\n(1433.48, 1436.36)  Be ready, it encourages.\n(1436.36, 1439.18)  Be ready when he comes and knocks.\n(1440.6, 1444.4)  And then the second parable speaks about the importance\n(1444.4, 1447.88)  of right behavior in the presence.\n(1447.88, 1452.88)  The servants are given responsibilities, things to do now.\n(1453.3, 1456.44)  The faithful and prudent steward whom the master\n(1456.44, 1460.76)  puts in charge of his servants to distribute\n(1460.76, 1463.62)  the food allowance at the proper time.\n(1464.9, 1469.42)  The steward who is found doing so upon the master's return\n(1469.42, 1473.54)  is rewarded, the one who abuses his authority\n(1473.54, 1476.26)  by taking advantage is punished.\n(1477.62, 1482.62)  Together, these two parables encourage a balance\n(1482.82, 1486.1)  regarding attention to future reward\n(1486.1, 1488.9)  and current responsibility.\n(1488.9, 1493.46)  The fact of future judgment calls one right back\n(1493.46, 1497.0)  to the realities and responsibilities of this life.\n(1497.96, 1497.0) \n(1507.24, 1513.72)  The deeds we do now will be mercifully and justly evaluated in the future. A woman once approached John Wesley, the founder of the Methodist Church, with an interesting\n(1513.72, 1515.72)  question.\n(1515.72, 1523.24)  Suppose she said that you knew for certain that you were going to die and meet your maker\n(1523.24, 1525.9)  at the stroke of midnight tomorrow.\n(1526.98, 1530.9)  How would you spend your time between now and then?\n(1532.06, 1535.26)  And Wesley replied, well madam,\n(1535.26, 1538.98)  just as I intend to spend it now,\n(1538.98, 1541.14)  I will preach here this evening,\n(1541.14, 1545.1)  at service again tomorrow morning I will preach.\n(1545.1, 1549.74)  After that, I will ride to another church to preach there,\n(1549.74, 1553.22)  and in the afternoon I will meet the church leaders.\n(1554.14, 1556.28)  Then I will go home to dinner,\n(1556.28, 1559.64)  talk and pray with my family as usual,\n(1559.64, 1563.2)  retire to my room about 10 p.m.,\n(1563.2, 1567.76)  commend myself to God, lie down to rest,\n(1567.76, 1572.76)  and if you are right, I will waken to eternal glory.\n(1574.7, 1578.84)  Present and future, perfectly together.\n(1579.74, 1609.42)  I believe in one God, the Father Almighty.\n(1609.42, 1616.06)  of heaven and earth of all things visible and invisible i believe in one lord jesus christ\n(1616.06, 1623.18)  the only begotten son of god born of the father before all ages god from god light from light\n(1623.18, 1629.5)  through god through true god begotten not made consubstantial with the father through him all\n(1629.5, 1636.7)  things were made for us and for our salvation he came down from heaven and by the holy spirit was\n(1636.7, 1644.06)  incarnate of the Virgin Mary and became man. For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate.\n(1644.06, 1649.5)  He suffered death and was buried and rose again in the third day in accordance with the scriptures.\n(1650.14, 1655.74)  He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will come again in glory\n(1655.74, 1662.46)  to judge the living and the dead and his kingdom will have no end. I believe in the Holy Spirit,\n(1662.46, 1666.46)  the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father and the Son,\n(1667.1, 1672.22)  who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified, who has spoken through the prophets.\n(1673.02, 1679.66)  I believe in one holy Catholic and Apostolic Church. I confess one baptism for the forgiveness\n(1679.66, 1686.22)  of sins. I look forward to the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come. Amen.\n(1692.06, 1686.22) \n(1699.42, 1705.78)  We lift up our needs to the Lord, trusting in his profound love and care for us. For all members of the Church, may the Lord grant us wisdom and humility so that we may\n(1705.78, 1708.62)  grow in holiness.\n(1708.62, 1710.02)  We pray to the Lord.\n(1710.02, 1712.7)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1712.7, 1715.32)  for the leaders of all nations.\n(1715.32, 1718.6)  May God grant them wisdom and compassion\n(1718.6, 1722.36)  as they strive to foster peace in our world.\n(1722.36, 1724.88)  May they be inspired by the Holy Spirit\n(1724.88, 1728.92)  to seek justice, dialogue, and reconciliation\n(1728.92, 1731.22)  in all their decisions.\n(1731.22, 1733.84)  We especially pray for the leaders involved\n(1733.84, 1737.0)  in the conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine.\n(1737.92, 1739.44)  We pray to the Lord.\n(1739.44, 1740.76)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1742.6, 1740.76) \n(1750.2, 1751.64)  For those without faith, may the Holy Spirit touch their hearts and guide them to Christ. We pray to the Lord.\n(1751.64, 1754.72)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1754.72, 1761.28)  For the sick and all those who feel burdened by the difficulties they face daily, may God\n(1761.28, 1764.56)  grant them comfort and healing.\n(1764.56, 1765.96)  We pray to the Lord.\n(1765.96, 1768.98)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1768.98, 1774.9)  For those who have died in the light of faith, especially Norah Jennings, for whom this Mass\n(1774.9, 1781.94)  is offered, and for all of our deceased relatives, friends, and parishioners, may they enjoy\n(1781.94, 1788.42)  a life in communion with the Trinity and all the saints, we pray to the Lord.\n(1788.42, 1791.44)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1791.44, 1797.54)  May the silent prayers in our hearts be lifted up to God, who knows our needs even before\n(1797.54, 1808.34)  we ask we pray to the Lord Lord hear our prayer Oh God we join our prayers with\n(1808.34, 1812.86)  those of our brothers and sisters throughout the world and we make them in\n(1812.86, 1819.86)  confidence in the name of Jesus who is Lord forever and ever amen\n(1821.02, 1819.86) \n(1826.86, 1835.86)  Please join us in singing number 563, Be Not Afraid, number 563.\n(1844.86, 1853.86)  You shall cross the barren desert, but you shall not die of thirst. You shall wander far in safety, for you do not know the way.\n(1853.86, 1862.86)  You shall speak your words in foreign language, and know all will understand.\n(1862.86, 1871.86)  You shall see the face of God and live.\n(1871.86, 1878.86)  If you pass the raging waters in the sea,\n(1878.86, 1885.86)  If you pass the raging waters in the sea,\n(1885.86, 1892.86)  If you pass the raging waters in the sea,\n(1892.86, 1899.86)  If you pass the raging waters in the sea,\n(1899.86, 1912.58)  In the sea you shall not drown, If you walk amid the many glades you shall not re-hold.\n(1912.58, 1921.62)  If you stand before the moor of hell, And earth is at your side,\n(1921.62, 1930.62)  Oh, that I am with you through it all.\n(1930.62, 1935.62)  Be not afraid.\n(1935.62, 1940.12)  I go before your voice.\n(1940.12, 1946.62)  Come follow me, and I will give you rest.\n(1950.62, 1946.62) \n(1956.98, 1966.9)  Pray, my sisters and brothers, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God the Almighty Father.\n(1966.9, 1972.5)  Be pleased, O Lord, to accept the offerings of your Church, for in your mercy you have\n(1972.5, 1977.98)  given them to be offered, and by your power you transform them into the mystery of our\n(1977.98, 1981.94)  salvation, through Christ our Lord.\n(1981.94, 1990.26)  The Lord be with you, lift up your hearts, let us give thanks to the Lord our God.\n(1990.26, 1995.14)  It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, always and everywhere to give you\n(1995.14, 2001.74)  thanks, Lord, Holy Father, Almighty and Eternal God, through Christ our Lord.\n(2001.74, 2007.54)  For through his paschal mystery he accomplished the marvelous deeds by which he freed us from\n(2007.54, 2013.98)  the yoke of sin and death, summoning us to the glory of being now called a chosen race,\n(2013.98, 2020.86)  a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for your own possession, to proclaim everywhere\n(2020.86, 2027.5)  your mighty works, for you have called us out of darkness into your own wonderful light.\n(2027.5, 2033.34)  And so with the angels and archangels, with thrones and dominions, and with all the hosts\n(2033.34, 2039.18)  and powers of heaven, we sing the hymn of your glory, as without end we acclaim.\n(2057.5, 2086.5)  your glory, Hosanna in the highest, Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, Hosanna in the highest, Hosanna in the highest.\n(2087.5, 2096.94)  You are indeed holy, O Lord, the fount of all holiness.\n(2096.94, 2102.06)  Make holy, therefore, these gifts, we pray, by sending down your Spirit upon them like\n(2102.06, 2109.54)  the dewfall, so that they may become for us the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.\n(2109.54, 2116.7)  At the time he was betrayed and entered willingly into his passion.\n(2116.7, 2122.8)  He took bread, and giving thanks, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying,\n(2122.8, 2130.8)  Take this, all of you, and eat of it, for this is my body, which will be given up for you.\n(2141.8, 2145.5)  In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took the chalice,\n(2145.5, 2149.14)  and once more, giving thanks, he gave it to his disciples,\n(2149.14, 2153.54)  saying, take this, all of you, and drink from it,\n(2153.54, 2156.18)  for this is the chalice of my blood,\n(2156.18, 2159.1)  the blood of the new and eternal covenant,\n(2159.1, 2162.1)  which will be poured out for you and for many\n(2162.1, 2163.98)  for the forgiveness of sins.\n(2164.9, 2167.34)  Do this in memory of me.\n(2168.46, 2167.34) \n(2193.34, 2202.54)  The mystery of faith When we eat this bread, and drink this cup, we proclaim thy death, O Lord, until you come again.\n(2204.14, 2207.82)  Therefore, as we celebrate the memorial of his death and resurrection,\n(2208.38, 2212.14)  we offer you, Lord, the bread of life and the chalice of salvation,\n(2212.86, 2218.54)  giving thanks that you have held us worthy to be in your presence and minister to you.\n(2219.82, 2218.54) \n(2226.38, 2234.5)  Humbly we pray that partaking of the body and blood of Christ we may be gathered into one by the Holy Spirit. Remember Lord your church spread throughout the world and bring her to the fullness\n(2234.5, 2241.78)  of charity together with Leo our Pope, Richard our Bishop, and all who minister in your church.\n(2241.78, 2248.1)  Remember also our brothers and sisters who have fallen asleep in the hope of\n(2248.1, 2254.3)  the resurrection, and all who have died in your mercy. Welcome them into the\n(2254.3, 2260.06)  light of your presence. Have mercy on us all, we pray, that with the Blessed\n(2260.06, 2265.18)  Virgin Mary, Mother of God and Gate of Heaven, with Blessed Joseph her spouse,\n(2265.18, 2271.36)  with the Blessed Apostles, St. Brigid, St. Augustine, and all the saints who have\n(2271.36, 2277.12)  pleased you throughout the ages.

May almighty God have mercy on us all, forgive us our sins, and bring each of us to everlasting life.\n(309.0, 312.0)  Let us pray.\n(312.0, 319.0)  O God, who made St. Jacob's hand up, radiated with outstanding merits in different walks of life,\n(319.0, 328.0)  Grant us through word intercession and walking painfully in our location, we may constantly be examined as a shining light.\n(328.0, 335.0)  Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever. Amen.\n(349.0, 355.56)  A reading from the\n(378.86, 355.56) \n(361.56, 380.92)  speaking to all Israel,\n(361.56, 365.76)  I am no longer able to\n(365.76, 367.26)  move above freely.\n(367.26, 369.26)  Besides, the Lord has told me\n(369.26, 371.26)  that I shall not cross the Jordan.\n(371.26, 374.26)  It is the Lord your God who will cross before you.\n(374.26, 377.26)  He will destroy these nations before you,\n(377.26, 380.26)  that you may supplant them.\n(380.26, 383.26)  It is Joshua who will cross before you,\n(383.26, 385.26)  as God has promised.\n(385.26, 387.26)  The Lord will deal with them\n(387.26, 389.26)  just as he dealt with Shion and Org,\n(389.26, 391.26)  the kings of the Amorites,\n(391.26, 395.26)  When, therefore, the Lord\n(395.8, 398.04)  delivers them up to you,\n(398.04, 399.8)  you must deal with them\n(399.8, 402.14)  exactly as I have ordered you.\n(402.14, 404.14)  Be brave and steadfast,\n(404.14, 406.14)  have no fear or dread of them,\n(406.14, 408.14)  for it is the Lord your God\n(408.14, 410.14)  who marches with you.\n(410.14, 412.14)  He will never fail you\n(412.14, 414.14)  or forsake you.\"\n(414.14, 416.14)  Then Moses summoned Joshua,\n(416.14, 418.14)  and in the presence of all Israel,\n(418.14, 420.14)  he said to him,\n(420.14, 425.18)  to the land which the Lord\n(448.64, 425.18) \n(429.02, 431.18)  you must put them in possession of their heritage.\n(431.18, 433.18)  It is the Lord who marches before you.\n(433.18, 435.18)  He will be with you and will never fail or forsake you.\n(435.18, 437.18)  Do not fear or be dismissed.\n(437.18, 439.18)  The word of the Lord.\n(439.18, 441.18)  Thanks be to God.\n(441.18, 443.18)  The portion of the Lord is his back.\n(443.18, 445.18)  The Lord is his people.\n(445.18, 447.18)  For I will sing the Lord's renown.\n(447.18, 449.18)  O proclaim the greatness of our God.\n(449.18, 451.18)  The rock, how heartless are his deeds.\n(451.18, 458.48)  God, the rock, how faultless are his deeds, how right all his ways. The portion of\n(458.48, 464.32)  the Lord is his people. Think back to the days of old, reflect on the years of age\n(464.32, 470.4)  upon age. Ask your father and he will inform you. Ask your elders and they will\n(470.4, 476.24)  tell you. The portion of the Lord is his people. When most of the high assigned\n(476.24, 480.8)  the nation's their heritage, when he parceled out the descendants of Adam,\n(480.8, 485.72)  he set up the boundaries of the peoples after the number of the sons of Israel.\n(485.72, 491.96)  The portions of the Lord is his people. While the Lord's own portion was Jacob,\n(491.96, 498.32)  his hereditary share was Israel. The Lord alone was their leader, no strange God\n(498.32, 504.28)  was with them. The portion of the Lord is his people.\n(510.8, 530.96)  The Lord be with you, a reading from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew.\n(530.96, 538.16)  The disciples approached Jesus and said, who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?\n(538.16, 542.12)  He called a child over, placed it in their midst and said,\n(542.12, 546.56)  Amen, I say to you, unless you turn and become like children,\n(546.56, 548.82)  you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.\n(549.92, 553.72)  Whoever becomes humble like this child\n(553.72, 555.76)  is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.\n(556.76, 560.0)  And whoever receives one such child\n(560.0, 563.2)  as this in my name receives me.\n(564.16, 567.2)  So that you may not despise one of these little ones,\n(567.2, 575.04)  For I say to you that their angels in heaven always look upon the face of my heavenly Father.\n(575.04, 577.96)  What is your opinion?\n(577.96, 582.56)  If a man had a hundred sheep and one of them goes astray, will he not leave the ninety-nine\n(582.56, 586.38)  in the hills and go search for the stray?\n(586.38, 592.04)  And if he finds it, amen I say to you, he rejoices more over it than the ninety-nine\n(592.04, 594.84)  that did not stray.\n(594.84, 597.76)  in just the same way it is\n(597.76, 601.24)  in just the same way it is not the will of your heavenly father\n(601.24, 604.48)  that one of these little ones be lost\n(604.48, 611.48)  the gospel of the Lord\n(612.6, 615.68)  i think our scriptures there's lots there right but i think our scriptures\n(615.68, 619.84)  today are reminding us of like our most important resource which is\n(619.84, 622.56)  human resource\n(622.56, 624.44)  and oftentimes\n(624.44, 629.44)  the great value that we have in one another is overlooked.\n(629.52, 633.16)  And so Jesus is, I think, reminding us to,\n(633.16, 635.92)  not just to look and to appreciate,\n(635.92, 638.6)  but to look where maybe you wouldn't have thought\n(638.6, 642.6)  to find him, to find goodness, to find the kingdom.\n(642.6, 645.28)  Sometimes it's in the people we literally overlook,\n(645.28, 646.76)  like children, right?\n(647.72, 650.2)  Or the elderly, or the, on and on.\n(650.2, 652.64)  I think we're being invited today to consider\n(652.64, 655.68)  how it is that we might be humble like God,\n(655.68, 658.36)  God who is all powerful, all everything\n(658.36, 662.28)  that comes among us as one of us as a child,\n(663.32, 667.36)  but also how we might find that in one another.\n(667.36, 672.36)  We might seek out one another that lost, that won,\n(672.4, 675.76)  and find in them the presence of God,\n(675.76, 678.94)  but then also like let them know that it's there.\n(678.94, 681.58)  I think that's sometimes where we drop the ball.\n(681.58, 683.7)  We can be really nice\n(683.7, 685.9)  and do nice things.\n(685.9, 690.34)  But we have to challenge ourselves sometimes to step beyond\n(690.34, 693.42)  social work and into discipleship.\n(693.42, 696.1)  And I think that's just something that we always have to kind of keep in mind and\n(696.1, 700.46)  that's something that the Lord is just reminding us to try to think about today.\n(700.46, 701.02)  So lots there.\n",

Grant us through her intercession that walking faithfully in our vocation we may constantly be an example of shining light through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, forever and ever. Amen.\n(348.0, 351.0)  Let us now be attentive to God's sacred word.\n(357.0, 359.0)  a\n(365.6, 367.6)  Reading from the book of Deuteronomy\n(368.92, 375.04)  When Moses had finished speaking to all Israel he said to them I am now\n(376.04, 380.8)  120 years old and then no longer able to move about freely\n(381.88, 380.8) \n(388.44, 392.52)  Besides, the Lord has told me that I shall not cross this Jordan. It is the Lord your God who will cross before you.\n(392.52, 398.6)  He will destroy these nations before you, that you may supplant them.\n(398.6, 404.08)  It is Joshua who will cross before you, as the Lord promised.\n(404.08, 410.2)  The Lord will deal with them just as he dealt with Sihon and Og, the king of the Amorites\n(410.2, 414.02)  whom he destroyed and with their country.\n(414.02, 417.66)  When therefore the Lord delivers them up to you,\n(417.66, 422.18)  you must deal with them exactly as I have ordered you.\n(422.18, 425.14)  Be brave and steadfast.\n(425.14, 428.38)  Have no fear or dread of them,\n(428.38, 432.66)  for it is the Lord your God who marches with you.\n(432.66, 438.0)  He will never fail you or forsake you.\n(438.0, 447.46)  Then Moses summoned Joshua and in the presence of all Israel said to him, be brave and steadfast,\n(447.46, 452.8)  for you must bring this people into the land which the Lord swore to their fathers he would\n(452.8, 454.22)  give them.\n(454.22, 458.84)  You must put them in possession of their heritage.\n(458.84, 461.28)  It is the Lord who marches before you.\n(461.28, 466.24)  He will be with you and will never fail you or forsake you.\n(466.24, 470.36)  So do not fear or be dismayed.\n(470.36, 473.14)  Word of the Lord.\n(473.14, 479.16)  The portion of the Lord is his people.\n(479.16, 484.84)  For I will sing the Lord's renown, O pray, proclaim the greatness of our God.\n(484.84, 492.96)  The rock, how faultless are his deeds, how right all his ways.\n(492.96, 495.64)  Think back on days of old.\n(495.64, 504.2)  on the years of age upon age. Ask your father and he will inform you. Ask your elders and\n(504.2, 513.74)  they will tell you. When the Most High assigned the nations their heritage, when he parceled\n(513.74, 519.84)  out the descendants of Adam, he set up the boundaries of the peoples after the number\n(519.84, 528.72)  of the sons of Israel. While the Lord's own portion was Jacob, his hereditary\n(528.72, 537.4)  share was Israel. The Lord alone was their leader. No strange God was with him.\n(549.84, 563.32)  The Lord be with you, reading from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew.\n(563.32, 567.74)  The disciples approached Jesus and said, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?\n(567.74, 572.36)  He called a child over, placed it in their midst and said, Amen, I say to you, unless\n(572.36, 577.34)  you turn and become like children, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.\n(577.34, 582.1)  Whoever becomes humble like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven, and\n(582.1, 587.1)  whoever receives one child such as this in my name receives me.\n(587.1, 592.54)  So what you do not despise one of these little ones, for I say to you that their angels in\n(592.54, 596.98)  heaven always look upon the face of my heavenly Father.\n(596.98, 597.98)  What is your opinion?\n(597.98, 604.38)  If a man had a hundred sheep and one of them would go astray, will he not leave the ninety-nine\n(604.38, 609.96)  in the hills and go and search for the stray and if he finds it amen I say to\n(609.96, 616.5)  you he rejoices more over that one over the 99 that did not go astray in just\n(616.5, 621.66)  the same way it is not the will of my Heavenly Father that one of these little\n(621.66, 629.58)  ones be lost gospel of the Lord praise to you Lord Jesus Christ beautiful\n(629.58, 632.82)  reading today and we've heard it many times but there's different spins on it\n(632.82, 638.34)  today where we realize that it's God's nature to love us as we are.\n(638.34, 644.34)  He'll do anything to go after our hearts, and so they use that image of the 99 sheep.\n(644.34, 650.9)  It would be crazy to leave them alone, but Christ is crazy for us.\n(650.9, 654.1)  I liked the meditation this morning that they found.\n(654.1, 659.78)  Friends, our feature of today's Gospel is the craziness of the shepherd.\n(659.78, 663.98)  If a man had 100 sheep and one of them goes astray,\n(663.98, 667.26)  will he not leave the 99 in the hills\n(667.26, 669.46)  and go and search for the stray?\n(669.46, 672.26)  Well, the implied answer is no.\n(672.26, 674.54)  Who would take that great risk\n(674.54, 678.9)  of putting the 99 in danger just to find one?\n(678.9, 682.06)  It's a bad economic deal.\n(682.06, 685.32)  Why would God fret over one little soul?\n(685.32, 686.88)  Why should he bother?\n(687.98, 686.88) \n(690.44, 694.64)  Today we focus on this beautiful theme. Well, it's God's nature. It's what He does.\n(694.64, 698.3)  As Catherine of Siena, in Siena,\n(698.3, 702.24)  Italy, there's a beautiful phrase that she uses,\n(702.24, 707.16)  pazio d'amore. If you're Italian, you put your whole soul in.\n(707.16, 711.44)  Pazio d'amore. And what does that mean?\n(711.44, 716.56)  It means crazy in love. St. Catherine was reminding us that God\n(716.56, 720.16)  is crazy in love for you and me.\n(720.16, 723.8)  No matter where you go, his prayers will follow us\n(723.8, 725.12)  and touch us.\n(725.12, 729.32)  God is so crazy as if you were the only one in the world.\n(729.32, 731.26)  Isn't that nice to think of?\n(731.26, 733.64)  When you're struggling and you find, where is God?\n(733.64, 736.92)  You are more special to him than anyone else that moment,\n(736.92, 738.84)  that moment, kratzi.\n(738.84, 740.44)  So we pray for that beautiful theme.\n(740.44, 743.52)  I'm gonna use that again in a couple of retreats\n(743.52, 747.08)  for faculty to realize that God is using them.\n(747.08, 748.98)  This new year of school begins\n(748.98, 753.08)  as an image of God's grace, pazio de morni.\n(753.08, 755.92)  Let us now ask the Lord to open his love to us.\n(755.92, 758.32)  For anyone who's struggling in need of our prayers,\n(758.32, 759.84)  we pray to the Lord.\n(759.84, 761.32)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(761.32, 762.44)  We pray for our world.\n(762.44, 765.04)  May the Holy Spirit touch the hearts of leaders\n(765.04, 768.32)  and inspire them to work for peace and posterity of all.\n(768.32, 769.7)  We pray to the Lord.\n(770.66, 772.78)  For the unemployed and for those who work\n(772.78, 776.22)  and still struggle to make ends meet, we pray to the Lord.\n(777.22, 780.1)  For all of you gathered here this summer day,\n(780.1, 782.94)  that the Lord will bless you and guide you today,\n(782.94, 784.28)  we pray to the Lord.\n(785.26, 787.38)  And we always remember in our families\n(787.38, 789.5)  and our intentions for the parishioners,\n(789.5, 792.54)  for those who have died in the light of faith,\n(792.54, 794.74)  may God's grace and love,\n(794.74, 796.38)  pazio de mori,\n(796.38, 798.54)  bring us to the gift of God's resurrection,\n(798.54, 799.86)  we pray to the Lord.\n(800.72, 799.86) \n(804.54, 808.1)  loving father we open our prayers to you this beautiful day asking that you deal with them according to your will we pray for all those that travel this day\n(808.1, 813.86)  through Christ our Lord amen let us celebrate\n(859.86, 888.86)  Pray, my brothers and sisters, that this sacrifice may be acceptable to the Godly Almighty Father.\n(888.86, 900.38)  We present our oblations to you, O Lord, this day, humbly praying that you may listen to\n(900.38, 905.14)  our prayers this day as we follow the gift of the example of your saints to offer you\n(905.14, 909.18)  our lives to you through Christ our Lord.\n(909.18, 917.1)  My friends, the Lord be with you, lift up your hearts.\n(917.1, 923.1)  us give thanks to the Lord our God. It is truly right in just our duty and our\n(923.1, 927.74)  salvation, always and everywhere to give you thanks, Father most holy, for your\n(927.74, 932.3)  beloved Son Jesus Christ, your word through whom you made all things, whom\n(932.3, 936.3)  you sent as our Savior and Redeemer, incarnate by the Holy Spirit and born of\n(936.3, 940.2)  the Virgin, fulfilling your will and gaining you through your holy people, he stretched\n(940.2, 944.62)  out his hands and endured his passion, so to break the bonds of death and manifest\n(944.62, 949.38)  the resurrection. And so with all the angels and saints, we declare you, O Lord, as with\n(949.38, 956.38)  one voice we acclaim, Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of hosts, heaven and earth are full of\n(956.38, 962.42)  your glory, Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, Hosanna\n(962.42, 968.9)  in the highest. You are indeed holy, O Lord, the fount of all holiness. Make holy these\n(968.9, 973.78)  gifts, we pray, by sending down your Spirit upon them like the dewfall, that they may\n(973.78, 978.78)  come for us the body and blood of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.\n(978.78, 983.28)  At the time he was betrayed and entered willingly into his passion,\n(983.28, 987.28)  he took bread and, giving thanks, broke it, gave it to his disciples, saying,\n(987.28, 993.28)  Take this, all of you, and eat of it, for this is my body, which will be given up for you.\n(1001.78, 993.28) \n(1005.28, 1008.28)  In a similar way, when Sephah was entered, he took the chalice. Once more giving thanks, he gave it to his disciples, saying,\n(1008.28, 1011.28)  Take this, all of you, and drink from it.\n(1011.28, 1016.28)  For this is the chalice of my blood, the blood of the new and eternal covenant,\n(1016.28, 1022.28)  which will be poured out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins.\n(1022.28, 1024.28)  Do this in memory of me.\n(1031.28, 1035.28)  The mystery of faith, when we eat this bread and drink this cup,\n(1035.28, 1039.28)  we proclaim your death, O Lord, until you come again.\n(1039.28, 1043.28)  Therefore, as we celebrate the memorial of his death and resurrection,\n(1043.28, 1047.28)  we offer you, Lord, the bread of life and the chalice of salvation,\n(1047.28, 1050.28)  giving thanks that you have held us worthy\n(1050.28, 1055.28)  worthy to be in your presence and minister to you.\n(1055.28, 1060.84)  Humbly we pray that partaking of the body and blood of Christ,\n(1060.84, 1065.28)  we may be gathered into one by the Holy Spirit.\n(1065.28, 1068.24)  Remember, Lord, your church spread throughout the world.\n(1068.24, 1070.24)  Bring her to the fullness of charity,\n(1070.24, 1072.92)  together with Leo our Pope, Princess our Bishop,\n(1072.92, 1076.48)  Sister Ginger Mattel, and all your saints and clergy.\n(1076.48, 1078.88)  Remember our prayers this day for your servants,\n(1078.88, 1082.64)  parishioners of our parishes that the Lord will bless them. You who have called\n(1082.64, 1086.92)  them from this world to yourself, grant that they who were united with your son\n(1086.92, 1093.88)  in a death like his may also be one with him in the resurrection. Remember also\n(1093.88, 1098.12)  our brothers and sisters who have fallen asleep in the hope of the resurrection\n(1098.12, 1104.16)  and all who have died in your mercy. Welcome them into the light of your face.\n(1104.16, 1109.16)  Have mercy on us all, we pray, with the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God,\n(1109.16, 1115.16)  with the Blessed Apostles, St. Jane, and all the saints who have pleased you throughout the ages,\n(1115.16, 1124.16)  that we may merit to be coheirs to eternal life and praise and glorify you through your Son, Jesus Christ.\n(1124.16, 1130.16)  For it is through him, with him in him, O God Almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\n(1130.16, 1136.16)  Our glory and honor is yours, forever and ever. Amen.\n(1139.16, 1144.16)  At the Savior's command, informed by divine teaching, we dare to say,\n(1144.16, 1147.16)  Our Father, who art in heaven,\n(1147.16, 1148.16)  hallowed be thy name.\n(1148.16, 1151.16)  Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,\n(1151.16, 1153.16)  on earth as it is in heaven.\n(1153.16, 1156.16)  Give us this day our daily bread,\n(1156.16, 1158.16)  and forgive us our trespasses,\n(1158.16, 1166.16)  as we forgive those who trespass against us and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.\n(1166.16, 1171.16)  Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil. Graciously grant peace in our days,\n(1171.16, 1180.16)  that by the help of your mercy we may be always free from sin, safe from all distress,\n(1180.16, 1187.16)  as we await the blessed hope in the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ.\n(1187.16, 1192.16)  For the kingdom, the power and the glory are yours, now and forever.\n(1192.16, 1195.16)  Lord Jesus Christ, who said to your apostles,\n(1195.16, 1198.16)  Peace I leave you, my peace I give you.\n(1198.16, 1202.16)  Look not on our sins, but on the faith of your Church,\n(1202.16, 1207.16)  and graciously grant her peace and unity in accordance with your will,\n(1207.16, 1211.16)  who live and reign forever and ever.\n(1211.16, 1214.16)  May the peace of the Lord be with you always.\n(1214.16, 1217.16)  This beautiful day, let us love each other with a sign of that peace.\n(1239.16, 1243.16)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world. Have mercy on us.\n(1243.16, 1247.16)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1247.16, 1251.16)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, grant us

us pray.\n(1504.54, 1509.66)  May the communion in your sacrament this day consume us with your saving love and confirm\n(1509.66, 1513.78)  from us in the light of your truth through Christ our Lord.\n(1513.78, 1516.58)  Well, stay cool today, lots of water,\n(1516.58, 1519.3)  but hope under that phrase, piazzo di mori,\n(1519.3, 1523.5)  piazzo di mori, crazy in God's love for us this

        "transcript": "(149.0, 156.0)  Thank you so much for being with us today, and we'll see you in the next session.\n(239.0, 247.72)  Good morning. Welcome to St. Brigid and Gate of Heaven Parishes and San\n(247.72, 253.04)  Augustine Chapel community. Today we celebrate the 18th Sunday in ordinary\n(253.04, 258.68)  time. The presider for today's liturgy will be Monsignor Liam. Please remember\n(258.68, 263.96)  in your prayers Marie Todd, for whom this mass is offered, and for all of our\n(263.96, 268.56)  deceased relatives, friends, and parishioners. We do not pass the\n(268.56, 273.24)  collection basket. Instead we ask that you place your weekly offering into the\n(273.24, 278.08)  donation boxes at the doors of the church. Your weekly offering is very\n(278.08, 282.6)  important to the ministries that we provided our parishes. You may also\n(282.6, 287.92)  donate online. Please see today's bulletin for that. We are most grateful\n(287.92, 292.72)  for your weekly support. Please remember to take the bullet at home with you when\n(292.72, 296.8)  you leave today and kindly stand.\n(298.56, 324.76)  O God, come to my assistance, O Lord, make haste to help me.\n(324.76, 329.62)  You are my rescuer, my help, O Lord, do not delay.\n(329.62, 335.08)  In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, the grace of our Lord\n(335.08, 341.92)  Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with you all.\n(341.92, 346.56)  My sisters and brothers, we gather on this beautiful day to give praise and thanks to\n(346.56, 350.96)  God.\n(350.96, 357.36)  Jesus you are the way to the Father, Lord have mercy. Christ Jesus you're the truth\n(357.36, 363.88)  that sets us free, Christ have mercy. Lord Jesus you are the life that we are\n(363.88, 371.28)  called to share, Lord have mercy. May Almighty God have mercy in us, forgive\n(371.28, 378.88)  us our sins and bring us to everlasting life. Glory to God in the highest and on\n(378.88, 381.72)  on Earth, peace to people of goodwill.\n(381.72, 386.36)  We praise you, we bless you, we adore you, we glorify you.\n(386.36, 389.52)  We give you thanks for your great glory.\n(389.52, 393.86)  Lord God, Heavenly King, O God Almighty Father,\n(393.86, 397.36)  Lord Jesus Christ, Only Begotten Son,\n(397.36, 400.76)  Lord God, Lamb of God, Son of the Father,\n(400.76, 404.76)  you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(404.76, 409.14)  you take away the sins of the world, receive our prayer.\n(409.14, 411.82)  You are seated at the right hand of the Father,\n(411.82, 413.56)  have mercy on us.\n(413.56, 417.42)  For you alone are the Holy One, you alone are the Lord,\n(417.42, 420.74)  you alone are the Most High, Jesus Christ,\n(420.74, 425.1)  with the Holy Spirit, in the glory of God the Father, amen.\n(427.42, 428.5)  Let us pray.\n(433.02, 428.5) \n(439.26, 445.9)  Draw near to your servants, O Lord, and answer their prayers with unceasing kindness, that for those who glory in you as their Creator and Guide, you may restore what you have created\n(445.9, 449.18)  and keep safe what you have restored.\n(449.18, 454.26)  Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of\n(454.26, 466.1)  and the Holy Spirit,\n(482.88, 466.1) \n(475.86, 481.9)  book of Ecclesiastes. Vanity of vanities, says Kahaleth. Vanity of vanities. All things are vanity. Here is one who has labored with wisdom and knowledge and\n(481.9, 489.34)  skill, and yet to another who has not labored over it, he must leave property.\n(489.34, 496.34)  This also is vanity and a great misfortune. For what profit comes to man\n(496.34, 502.58)  from all the toil and anxiety of heart with which he is labored under the sun?\n(502.58, 511.54)  All his days are sorrow and grief is his occupation. Even at night his mind is not\n(511.54, 522.0)  at rest this also is vanity the word of the Lord if today you hear his voice\n(522.0, 531.5)  harden not your hearts you turn man back to dust saying return Oh children of men\n(531.5, 538.26)  for a thousand years in your sight are as yesterday now that it is past or as a\n(538.26, 547.66)  watch of the night you make an end of them in their sleep the next morning\n(547.66, 553.3)  they are like the changing grass which at dawn springs up in new but by evening\n(553.3, 563.7)  wilts and fades teach us to number our days aright that we may gain wisdom of\n(563.7, 574.54)  heart. Return, O Lord, how long. Have pity on your servants. Fill us at\n(574.54, 579.34)  daybreak with your kindness that we may shout for joy and gladness all our days,\n(579.34, 585.3)  and may the gracious care of the Lord our God be ours. Prosper the work of our\n(585.3, 591.38)  hands for us. Prosper the work of our hands. If today you hear his voice,\n(591.38, 598.84)  harden not your hearts. A reading from the letter of St. Paul to the Colossians.\n(598.84, 605.84)  Sisters and brothers, if you were raised with Christ, seek what is above, where\n(605.84, 612.32)  Christ is seated at the right hand of God. Think of what is above, not of what\n(612.32, 620.4)  is on earth, for you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God. When\n(620.4, 628.26)  Christ your life appears then you too will appear with him in glory. Put to\n(628.26, 634.44)  death then the parts of you that are earthly, immorality, impurity, passion, evil\n(634.44, 641.52)  desire, and the greed that is idolatry. Stop lying to one another since you have\n(641.52, 646.38)  taken off the old self with its practices and have put on a new self\n(646.38, 653.96)  which is being renewed for knowledge in the image of its creator. Here there is\n(653.96, 660.64)  not Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave\n(660.64, 670.28)  free, but Christ is all and in all. The word of the Lord.\n(676.38, 693.84)  the Lord be with you a reading from the Holy Gospel according to Luke someone in\n(693.84, 699.86)  the crowd said to Jesus teacher tell my brother to share the inheritance with me\n(699.86, 707.7)  he replied to him friend who appointed me as your judge and arbitrator then he\n(707.7, 713.54)  said to the crowd take care to guard against all greed for though one may be\n(713.54, 720.18)  rich one's life does not consist of possessions then he told them a parable\n(720.18, 725.94)  there was a rich man whose land produced a bountiful harvest he asked himself\n(725.94, 733.54)  what shall I do? For I do not have space to store my harvest. And he said, this is\n(733.54, 739.22)  what I shall do. I shall tear down my barns and build larger ones. There I\n(739.22, 745.02)  shall store all my grain and all and other goods and I shall say to myself,\n(745.02, 752.46)  now as for you, you have so many good things stored up for many years. Rest, eat,\n(752.46, 760.5)  drink, and be merry.' But God said to him,\n(775.78, 780.38)  The Gospel of the Lord.\n(782.46, 788.82)  My friends, the parable we have just heard could be told in every time and\n(788.82, 794.18)  place. It certainly spoke to Jesus's audience and I believe it speaks\n(794.18, 800.74)  powerfully to us too. It begins, there was a rich man whose land produced a\n(800.74, 807.78)  bountiful harvest. Notice the subject of the sentence is the land. The land\n(807.78, 815.06)  produced a bountiful harvest, not the man. And this reflects the Jewish insight\n(815.06, 819.5)  that whatever may be the human contribution in the process of the\n(819.5, 826.26)  farming, it is the land, the earth, that is the source of food. So an abundant\n(826.26, 833.74)  crop like the land itself is a gift of God. And the Sabbath's no-work law is\n(833.74, 840.44)  meant to help people stay in touch with this reality. But the landowner in the\n(840.44, 846.04)  parable has lost touch with this dimension of his own relationship with\n(846.04, 853.9)  the Creator and he asks himself what shall I do for I do not have space to\n(853.9, 860.92)  store my harvests. What shall I do? The very phrasing of the question shows that\n(860.92, 866.32)  he's got it all wrong. The man has lost his sense that the goods of the earth\n(866.32, 872.44)  are meant to meet the needs of all, not simply of the desires of those who\n(872.44, 879.76)  happen to manage the land. The landowner speaks too easily of microbes. For him\n(879.76, 885.44)  the unexpected abundance is not a boon for the community, rather it represents\n(885.44, 892.74)  a personal, represents a crisis of personal asset management. And then it\n(892.74, 898.58)  goes on, I will pull down my barns and build larger ones and there will I store\n(898.58, 905.02)  all my grain and my goods. I will have ample goods laid up for many years, relax,\n(905.02, 915.06)  eat, drink and be merry. I, I, I. No mention of the larger community here. It's a\n(915.06, 921.18)  question of my grain, my goods, my happiness. The man has allowed his greed\n(921.18, 927.02)  to destroy all his relationships, his relationship with the earth, with the\n(927.02, 935.82)  community, with himself, and with God. A wise person once remarked if we have all,\n(935.82, 943.1)  if we have an eye all the time for the next rung on the ladder, we miss out on\n(943.1, 953.18)  on the space in between, the space for family, for friends, for those in need, for God.\n(953.18, 961.58)  If I am what I have, and if what I have is lost, who am I?\n(961.58, 965.42)  And Jesus answers this question in the parable.\n(965.42, 970.86)  While wealth and the things of this world have merit and value, they do not satisfy\n(970.86, 979.48)  the deepest hearts. Yes, wealth can make you secure. How many of us have ever bought a\n(979.48, 985.14)  Mega Millions ticket in hope? But something more is needed. That's what the\n(985.14, 994.2)  Gospel tells us. And indeed, may I suggest it proposes four things. First of all, a\n(994.2, 1002.66)  healthy self-knowledge. If ignorance is bliss, why aren't there more people\n(1002.66, 1010.9)  jumping up and down for joy? No, ignorance is not bliss. Ignorance of self in\n(1010.9, 1016.82)  particular. The better we know ourselves, the better equipped we are to meet\n(1016.82, 1024.1)  life's challenges. Know your weaknesses and strengths. Don't let work, activity,\n(1024.1, 1032.86)  alcohol, pornography or whatever obscure the reality of who we are. Know yourself.\n(1032.86, 1040.78)  Know yourself as Jesus as God knows you and that's important and that's really\n(1040.78, 1048.22)  the second point. Know yourself as Jesus and God knows you because as God knows\n(1048.22, 1056.06)  you, God also loves you. Self-discovery can be painful, but each of us is blessed,\n(1056.06, 1064.34)  we're both blessed and broken, gifted and limited. Recognize and be\n(1064.34, 1070.46)  grateful for your talents. Accept those parts that need healing and growth and\n(1070.46, 1079.9)  God will see you through. Then thirdly, desire to grow. Desire to grow better, to\n(1079.9, 1086.5)  grow wiser. Desire to grow in relationship with God, in relationship with family and\n(1086.5, 1091.52)  friends, in relationship with the environment, in relationship with the\n(1091.52, 1098.96)  poor and needy. Whatever rung on the ladder you are on, desire to be fully\n(1098.96, 1108.8)  there, truly there. Don't look up or look down, be happy there. And then, then with\n(1108.8, 1118.84)  God's grace, you will move on. Finally, integrate your failures. To be human is\n(1118.84, 1125.64)  to err. You've heard me before, you heard me say this before, we all have three\n(1125.64, 1134.44)  bones, a wishbone, a backbone and a funny bone. A wishbone to dream dreams of a\n(1134.44, 1142.48)  good and a better world. A backbone that helps us to stand up where we are for\n(1142.48, 1150.64)  what we believe to be true and noble and just. And most important of all, a funny\n(1150.64, 1160.32)  bone, a funny bone to laugh at our mistakes, our blunders, our oversights. Who\n(1160.32, 1166.0)  are the ones that are truly rich? That's the question that today's Gospel\n(1166.0, 1173.52)  provokes. Who are the ones that are truly rich? Those who let Jesus guide them\n(1173.52, 1181.16)  to self-knowledge. The truly rich are those who know themselves. The truly\n(1181.16, 1186.92)  rich are those who know the mercy and love of God made known in Jesus Christ.\n(1186.92, 1193.44)  The truly rich are those who desire to grow and to use their talents in God's\n(1193.44, 1203.28)  service. The truly rich are those who integrate their failures and start anew.\n(1203.52, 1210.52)  Take care to guard against all greed, Jesus says in today's Gospel.\n(1210.52, 1217.52)  For though one may be rich, one's life does not consist of possessions.\n(1217.52, 1222.52)  How true, how very true that is.\n(1233.52, 1255.2)  I believe in God the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth, and in Jesus Christ his\n(1255.2, 1261.32)  only Son our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered\n(1261.32, 1267.18)  under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried. He descended into hell. On\n(1267.18, 1272.54)  the third day he rose again from the dead. He ascended into heaven and is seated at the\n(1272.54, 1277.7)  right hand of God of the Father Almighty. From there he will come to judge the living\n(1277.7, 1283.7)  and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church, the communion of\n(1283.7, 1290.34)  saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. Amen.\n(1291.32, 1299.06)  of the Church and the world.\n(1299.06, 1302.08)  United in our faith, let us present our prayers to our merciful God on behalf of the Church\n(1302.08, 1304.64)  and the world.\n(1304.64, 1310.8)  For the Church, may God provide her with the spiritual gifts she needs for her work of\n(1310.8, 1314.0)  evangelization, we pray to the Lord.\n(1314.0, 1315.76)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1315.76, 1322.38)  For all who govern the nations of the world, may the Holy Spirit fill them with wisdom,\n(1322.38, 1325.3)  with courage, and with prudence.\n(1325.3, 1328.44)  We pray to the Lord, Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1328.44, 1333.5)  For this faith community, may the grace of the sacraments increase our love for the Lord\n(1333.5, 1335.12)  and for each other.\n(1335.12, 1338.28)  We pray to the Lord, Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1338.28, 1345.0)  For all who are burdened with emotional, spiritual, or bodily struggles, may God grant them healing\n(1345.0, 1350.64)  and renewal we pray to the Lord Lord hear our prayer for all who have died in\n(1350.64, 1357.5)  the light of faith especially Marie Todd for whom this mass is offered for Claire\n(1357.5, 1363.6)  O'Rourke and for all of our deceased relatives friends and parishioners that\n(1363.6, 1368.22)  they may find their true home in the heavenly city with all who have gone\n(1368.22, 1374.54)  before them on the path to eternal life we pray to the Lord Lord hear our prayer\n(1374.54, 1379.7)  and may the silent prayers in our hearts be lifted up to God who knows our needs\n(1379.7, 1388.3)  even before we ask. We pray to the Lord. Lord hear our prayer.\n(1388.3, 1396.22)  Merciful Father hear our prayers. We ask them through Christ our Lord. Amen.\n(1404.54, 1429.56)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through your goodness we've received the\n(1429.56, 1433.88)  bread we offer you, fruit of the earth and work of human hands.\n(1433.88, 1450.64)  It will become for us the bread of life.\n(1450.64, 1456.52)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through your goodness we receive the wine\n(1456.52, 1461.88)  we offer you, fruit of the vine and work of human hands, it will become our spiritual\n(1461.88, 1462.88)  drink.\n(1462.88, 1482.78)  Pray, my sisters and brothers, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God the Almighty\n(1482.78, 1497.4)  Father. Graciously sanctify these gifts, O Lord, we pray, and accepting the\n(1497.4, 1502.9)  oblation of this spiritual sacrifice, make us an eternal offering to you,\n(1502.9, 1511.38)  through Christ our Lord. The Lord be with you. Lift up your hearts. Let us give\n(1511.38, 1517.02)  thanks to the Lord our God. It is truly right and just, our duty and our\n(1517.02, 1522.92)  salvation, always and everywhere to give you thanks, Lord, Holy Father Almighty and\n(1522.92, 1528.56)  Eternal God. For you laid the foundations of the world and have arranged the\n(1528.56, 1534.36)  changing of times and seasons. You formed us in your own image and set us over the\n(1534.36, 1539.08)  whole world in all its wonder to rule in your name over all that you have made\n(1539.08, 1545.04)  and forever praise you in your mighty works through Christ our Lord. And so\n(1545.04, 1551.88)  with all the angels we praise you as in joyful celebration we acclaim. Holy, holy,\n(1551.88, 1558.24)  holy, Lord God of hosts, heaven and earth are full of your glory, Hosanna in the\n(1558.24, 1565.6)  highest. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, Hosanna in the highest.\n(1567.0, 1565.6) \n(1572.96, 1578.44)  You are indeed holy, O Lord, the fount of all holiness. Make holy, therefore, these gifts, we pray, by sending down your Spirit upon them like the dewfall, so\n(1578.44, 1585.44)  that they may become for us the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ. At the\n(1585.44, 1590.92)  time he was betrayed and entered willingly into his passion, he took bread\n(1590.92, 1596.84)  and giving thanks, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying,\n(1596.84, 1604.44)  Take this, all of you, and eat of it, for this is my body, which will be given up for you.\n(1613.56, 1619.4)  In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took the chalice, and once more, giving thanks,\n(1619.4, 1622.7)  he gave it to his disciples, saying,\n(1622.7, 1625.94)  \"'Take this, all of you, and drink from it,\n(1625.94, 1628.5)  \"'for this is the chalice of my blood,\n(1628.5, 1631.38)  \"'the blood of the new and eternal covenant,\n(1631.38, 1634.4)  \"'which will be poured out for you and for many\n(1634.4, 1636.34)  \"'for the forgiveness of sins.\n(1637.34, 1639.92)  \"'Do this in memory of me.'\"\n(1640.92, 1639.92) \n(1655.04, 1661.64)  The mystery of faith. We proclaim your death, O Lord, and profess your resurrection until you come again. Therefore, as we celebrate the memorial\n(1661.64, 1666.2)  of his death and resurrection, we offer you, Lord, the bread of life and the\n(1666.2, 1672.48)  the chalice of salvation, giving thanks that you have held us worthy to be in\n(1672.48, 1679.32)  your presence and minister to you. Humbly we pray that partaking of the body and\n(1679.32, 1685.64)  blood of Christ we may be gathered into one by the Holy Spirit. Remember Lord\n(1685.64, 1691.76)  your church spread throughout the world and bring her to the fullness of charity\n(1691.76, 1697.6)  together with Leo our Pope, Richard our Bishop, and all who minister in your\n(1697.6, 1704.12)  Church. Remember also our brothers and sisters who have fallen asleep in the\n(1704.12, 1709.76)  hope of the Resurrection, and all who have died in your mercy. Welcome them\n(1709.76, 1717.6)  into the light of your face. Have mercy on us all, we pray, that with the Blessed\n(1717.6, 1722.32)  Virgin Mary, Mother of God and Gate of Heaven, with blessed Joseph, her spouse,\n(1722.32, 1728.56)  with the blessed Apostles, St. Brigid, St. Augustine, and all the Saints who have\n(1728.56, 1734.16)  pleased you throughout the ages, we may merit to be co-heirs to eternal life and\n(1734.16, 1741.12)  may praise and glorify you through your Son, Jesus Christ.\n(1741.68, 1741.12) \n(1748.52, 1756.96)  Through him, and with him, and in him, O God Almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, all glory and honor is yours forever and ever. Amen.\n(1760.76, 1767.28)  At the Savior's command and formed by divine teaching, we dare to say, Our\n(1767.28, 1774.4)  Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done\n(1774.4, 1780.96)  on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our\n(1780.96, 1787.48)  trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us and lead us not into\n(1787.48, 1793.52)  temptation but deliver us from evil. Deliver us Lord we pray from every evil,\n(1793.52, 1799.76)  graciously grant peace in our days that by the help of your mercy we may be\n(1799.76, 1806.32)  always free from sin and safe from all distress as we await the blessed hope\n(1806.32, 1811.36)  and the coming of our Savior Jesus Christ.\n(1813.88, 1819.54)  Lord Jesus Christ who said to your apostles peace I leave you my peace I\n(1819.54, 1825.5)  give you. Look not on our sins but on the faith of your church and graciously\n(1825.5, 1831.46)  grant her peace and unity in accordance with your will, who live and reign\n(1831.46, 1839.5)  forever and ever. The peace of the Lord be with you always. Let us offer each\n(1839.5, 1842.58)  other the sign of peace.\n(1849.54, 1854.54)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1854.54, 1859.54)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1859.54, 1865.54)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, grant us peace.\n(1870.54, 1877.54)  Behold the Lamb of God, behold him who takes away the sins of the world.\n(1877.54, 1883.38)  Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb. Lord, I am not worthy that\n(1883.38, 1890.7)  you should enter under my roof, but only say the word and my soul shall be healed.\n(1907.54, 1921.06)  the body of Christ. Amen. The body of Christ.\n(1967.54, 1972.54)  Thank you so much for joining us, and we'll see you next time.\n(2176.54, 2204.18)  O sacrament, most holy, O sacrament divine,\n(2204.18, 2210.14)  All praise and all thanksgiving be every knowment mine.\n(2210.14, 2213.98)  Vanity of vanities, says the preacher.\n(2213.98, 2222.5)  To be rich is to know yourself, to know the mercy and love of God, to desire to grow and\n(2222.5, 2231.48)  use your talents in God's service, and to trust and to know that with the power of God\n(2231.48, 2242.3)  we can start again, O sacrament most holy, O sacrament divine, all praise and all thanksgiving\n(2242.3, 2258.0)  be every moment thine.\n(2258.0, 2260.98)  Let us pray.\n(2260.98, 2266.86)  with constant protection, O Lord, those you renew with these heavenly gifts, and\n(2266.86, 2272.66)  in your never-failing care for them, make them worthy of eternal redemption\n(2272.66, 2280.94)  through Christ our Lord. The Lord be with you. May Almighty God bless you, the\n(2280.94, 2288.14)  Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Go forth proclaiming the Lord with your\n(2288.14, 2290.14)  lives.\n(2348.14, 2350.14)  .\n(2378.14, 2403.06)  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n(2403.06, 2405.06)  Thank you so much for joining us, and we'll see you next time.\n(2522.06, 2529.06)  So, thank you very much for joining us today, and we'll see you in the next session.\n",

The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with\n(349.04, 354.6)  you all. My sisters and brothers, we gather on this beautiful Sunday morning\n(354.6, 363.6)  to give praise and thanks to God. Lord Jesus, you are the way to the Father. Lord\n(363.6, 370.16)  have mercy. Lord have mercy. Christ Jesus you are the truth that sets us free. Christ have mercy.\n(370.16, 376.4)  Christ have mercy. Lord Jesus you are the life that we are called to share. Lord have mercy.\n(376.4, 383.92)  Lord have mercy. May almighty God have mercy in us, forgive us our sins and bring us to everlasting\n(383.92, 386.22)  life.\n(389.22, 399.82)  Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to people of good will. We praise\n(399.82, 413.82)  you, we bless you, we adore you, we glorify you, we give you thanks for your great glory.\n(413.82, 418.82)  Lord God, heavenly King,\n(418.82, 424.82)  O God, almighty Father,\n(424.82, 429.82)  Lord Jesus Christ,\n(429.82, 433.82)  only begotten Son,\n(433.82, 438.82)  Lord God, Lamb of God,\n(438.82, 442.82)  Son of the Father,\n(442.82, 449.7)  You take away the sins of the world.\n(449.7, 454.82)  Have mercy on us.\n(454.82, 461.7)  You take away the sins of the world.\n(461.7, 466.98)  Receive our prayer.\n(466.98, 476.46)  You are seated at the right end of the Father.\n(476.46, 485.44)  Have mercy on us.\n(485.44, 490.24)  For you alone are the Holy One.\n(490.24, 494.94)  You alone are the Lord.\n(494.94, 517.74)  You alone are the Most High, Jesus Christ with the Holy Spirit, in the glory of God the Father. Amen.\n(518.62, 519.5)  Let us pray.\n(522.86, 519.5) \n(527.9, 534.06)  Draw near to your servants, O Lord, and answer their prayers with unceasing kindness, that for those who glory in you as their Creator and Guide, you may\n(534.06, 539.66)  restore what you have created and keep safe what you have restored. Through our\n(539.66, 544.62)  Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy\n(544.62, 549.38)  the Spirit, God forever and ever.\n(556.18, 563.46)  A reading from a book of Ecclesiastes. Vanity of vanities, says Koheleth, vanity\n(563.46, 568.94)  of vanities, all things are vanity. Here is one who has labored with wisdom and\n(568.94, 574.22)  knowledge and skill, and yet to another who has not labored over it, he must\n(574.22, 580.82)  leave his property. This is also in his vanity and a great misfortune. For what\n(580.82, 585.8)  profit comes to a man from all the toil and anxiety of heart with which he has\n(585.8, 592.78)  labored under the Sun? All his days sorrow and grief is his occupation. Even\n(592.78, 601.02)  at night his mind is not at rest. This is also vanity. The Word of the Lord.\n(604.22, 633.22)  If today you hear his voice, harden not your hearts.\n(633.22, 647.8)  If today you hear his voice, harden not your hearts.\n(647.8, 657.72)  You turn man back to dust, saying return, O children of men.\n(657.72, 668.76)  For a thousand years in your sight,\n(687.72, 699.22)  You make an end of them in their sleep, The next morning they alight the changing grass,\n(699.22, 710.72)  Which at dawn springs upon you, But by evening wilts and fades.\n(710.72, 723.96)  If today, you hear his voice,\n(740.72, 758.08)  If today you hear his voice, harden not your hearts.\n(758.08, 768.72)  Fill us at daybreak with your kindness, that we may shout for joy and gladness all our\n(768.72, 782.3)  may the gracious care of the Lord, our God, be ours.\n(782.3, 785.3)  Prosper the work of our hands for us.\n(785.3, 788.3)  Prosper the work of our hands.\n(788.3, 795.3)  If today you hear his voice,\n(795.3, 801.3)  Lord, in not your hearts.\n(815.3, 819.3)  A reading from the letter of St. Paul to the Colossians.\n(819.3, 823.3)  Brothers and sisters, if you were raised with Christ,\n(823.3, 826.46)  Seek what is above, where Christ is seated\n(826.46, 828.74)  at the right hand of God.\n(828.74, 832.7)  Think of what is above, not of what is on earth.\n(832.7, 834.94)  For you have died, and your life is hidden\n(834.94, 836.9)  with Christ in God.\n(836.9, 839.02)  When Christ your life appears,\n(839.02, 841.68)  then you too will appear with him in glory.\n(842.56, 846.54)  Put to death, then, the parts of you that are earthly,\n(846.54, 851.54)  immortality, impurity, passion, evil desire,\n(851.72, 851.54) \n(857.54, 863.46)  in the greed that is adultery. Stop lying to one another since you have taken off the old self with its practices and have put on the new self which is being renewed for knowledge\n(863.46, 870.9)  in the image of its creator. Here there is not Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision,\n(871.54, 870.9) \n(882.86, 900.9)  barbarian, Scythian, slave, free. But Christ is all and in all. The word of the Lord.\n(913.9, 921.9)  Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah. Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of\n(921.9, 936.34)  of Heaven, Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.\n(936.34, 937.94)  The Lord be with you.\n(937.94, 939.3)  And with your spirit.\n(939.3, 944.62)  A reading from the Holy Gospel according to Luke.\n(944.62, 947.62)  Someone in the crowd said to Jesus,\n(947.62, 952.56)  Teacher, tell my brother to share the inheritance with me.\n(952.56, 959.34)  He replied to him, Friend who appointed me as your judge and arbitrator.\n(959.34, 966.72)  Then he said to the crowd, Take care to guard against all greed, for though one may be rich,\n(966.72, 971.26)  one's life does not consist of possessions.\n(971.26, 973.94)  Then he told them a parable.\n(973.94, 981.38)  was a rich man whose land produced a bountiful harvest. He asked himself what shall I do,\n(981.38, 988.16)  for I have not space to store my harvest. And he said, this is what I shall do. I shall\n(988.16, 995.2)  tear down my barns and build larger ones. Then I shall store all my grain and all other\n(995.2, 1002.08)  goods and I shall say to myself, now as for you, you have so many good things stored up\n(1002.08, 1012.76)  for many years, rest, eat, drink, be merry. But God said to him, you fool, this night\n(1012.76, 1018.32)  your life will be demanded of you, and the things you have prepared, to whom\n(1018.32, 1024.8)  will they belong? They will thus will it be for all who store up treasure for\n(1024.8, 1030.92)  themselves, but are not rich in what matters to God.\n(1032.08, 1045.12)  The Gospel of the Lord. My friends, the parable we have just heard could be told\n(1045.12, 1050.72)  in every time and place. It certainly spoke to Jesus' own\n(1050.72, 1057.56)  audience and I believe it speaks powerfully to us today. It begins,\n(1057.56, 1063.68)  was a rich man whose land produced a bountiful harvest.\" Notice that the\n(1063.68, 1071.12)  subject of the sentence is the land, not the man. The land produced a bountiful\n(1071.12, 1077.8)  harvest, and this reflects the wonderful Jewish insight that whatever the human\n(1077.8, 1084.24)  contribution might be in the process of farming, it is the land, the earth, that is\n(1084.24, 1090.86)  the source of food. So an abundant crop like the land itself is a gift of God\n(1090.86, 1097.2)  and the Sabbath no work law is meant to help people stay in touch with this\n(1097.2, 1103.72)  reality. But the landowner in the parable today has lost touch with this dimension\n(1103.72, 1111.32)  of his relationship with the Creator and then he asks himself what shall I do for\n(1111.32, 1118.0)  I do not have a space to store my harvest. What shall I do? The very phrasing of the\n(1118.0, 1125.12)  question shows that he got it wrong. The man has lost the sense that the goods of the earth\n(1125.12, 1131.34)  are not meant to meet the needs of all, not simply the desires of those who happen to\n(1131.34, 1139.62)  manage the land. The landowner speaks too easily of my crops. For him, the unexpected\n(1139.62, 1145.74)  abundance is not a boon for the community, rather it presents a crisis of\n(1145.74, 1153.78)  personal asset management. And then it gets worse. I will do this, he says. I will\n(1153.78, 1159.3)  pull down my barns and build larger ones and then I will store all my grain and\n(1159.3, 1166.94)  my goods. I will have ample goods laid up for many years, relax, eat, drink and be\n(1166.94, 1177.74)  Mary. I, I, I. Not a mention of the larger community. Here it is a question of my\n(1177.74, 1184.94)  goods, my grain, my happiness. This man allowed greed to destroy all his\n(1184.94, 1192.46)  relationships with the earth, with the community, with himself, and with God.\n(1192.46, 1201.7)  vanity of vanities. A wise person once remarked if you have an eye all the time\n(1201.7, 1208.76)  for the next rung of the ladder you will miss out on the space between them. The\n(1208.76, 1218.2)  space for family, for friends, for those in need, and for God. If I am what I have\n(1218.2, 1226.84)  and if I lose what I have, well then who am I? And Jesus answers this question in\n(1226.84, 1232.8)  the parable. While wealth and the things of this world have\n(1232.8, 1240.92)  merit and value, they truly do. Yet they do not satisfy the heart's deepest\n(1240.92, 1248.48)  desires. Yes, wealth can make life secure. How many of us have ever bought a\n(1248.48, 1256.16)  lottery ticket? But something more is needed, Jesus reminds us, and indeed may I\n(1256.16, 1264.7)  suggest that the Gospel of the readings today propose for. First of all, a healthy\n(1264.7, 1272.66)  self-knowledge. If ignorance is bliss, why aren't there more people jumping up and\n(1272.66, 1280.62)  down for joy? No, ignorance is not bliss. The better we know ourselves, the better\n(1280.62, 1286.78)  equipped we are to meet life's challenges. Know your weaknesses and your\n(1286.78, 1296.1)  strengths. Don't let work, activity, alcohol, pornography or whatever obscure\n(1296.1, 1305.58)  or hide who you really are. Know yourself. Know yourself as Jesus, as God knows you.\n(1305.58, 1313.92)  And that leads to the second, to know ourselves as Jesus and God knows us.\n(1313.92, 1322.36)  Because as God knows, God loves. Self-discovery can be painful. Each one of\n(1322.36, 1330.52)  us is both blessed and broken, gifted and limited. So recognizing ourselves who we\n(1330.52, 1339.12)  are before God, it is both a challenge and a reassurance. Accept those parts\n(1339.12, 1346.28)  that need healing and growth and God will see you through. That leads to the\n(1346.28, 1355.16)  third, desire to grow. Desire to grow better, to grow wiser. Desire to grow in\n(1355.16, 1361.08)  relationship with God, in relationship with family and friends, in relationship\n(1361.08, 1367.48)  with the environment, in relationship with the poor and the needy. Whatever\n(1367.48, 1376.66)  wrong on the ladder you are on, desire to be fully, truly there. Don't look up or\n(1376.66, 1386.26)  don't look down, be happy there. And then if you are, with God's grace, you will\n(1386.26, 1396.06)  move on. And finally, integrate the failures that inevitably come. To be\n(1396.06, 1404.04)  human is to err. You've heard me say many times before we have three bones, a wish\n(1404.04, 1412.32)  bone, a backbone and a funny bone. A wish bone to dream dreams of a good and a\n(1412.32, 1420.96)  better world. A backbone that helps us to stand up and to be to take principle for\n(1420.96, 1428.64)  what we believe to be just, to be noble, to be true. But perhaps more importantly,\n(1428.64, 1436.72)  a funny bone, a funny bone to laugh at our mistakes, our blunders, our oversights,\n(1436.72, 1445.52)  our presumptions. Who are the ones who are really rich? That's the question that\n(1445.52, 1452.36)  today's Gospel provokes. Well, Jesus suggests they are truly rich, the ones\n(1452.36, 1458.62)  who know themselves, who have a healthy self-knowledge, who know their weaknesses\n(1458.62, 1466.44)  and strengths. They are truly rich, those who know the mercy and love of God made\n(1466.44, 1474.72)  known in Jesus Christ. They are truly rich, those who desire to grow and use\n(1474.72, 1482.52)  their talents in God's service. They are truly rich, those who integrate their\n(1482.52, 1488.0)  failures and have the courage and strength, the courage and God-given\n(1488.0, 1496.88)  strength to start anew. Take care to guard against all greed, Jesus says in\n(1496.88, 1503.48)  the Gospel today. For though one may be rich, one's life does not consist of\n(1503.48, 1510.48)  of possessions. How true, how very true that is.\n(1533.48, 1542.84)  We profess the Apostles' Creed. I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Creator of\n(1542.84, 1548.36)  heaven and earth, and in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord, who was conceived by\n(1548.36, 1553.92)  the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was\n(1553.92, 1559.32)  crucified, died, and was buried. He descended into hell. On the third day he\n(1559.32, 1564.06)  rose again from the dead. He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right\n(1564.06, 1569.12)  hand of God the Father Almighty. From there he will come to judge the living\n(1569.12, 1574.3)  and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church, the\n(1574.3, 1579.1)  communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and\n(1579.1, 1587.82)  life everlasting. Amen. United in our faith, let us present our prayers to our\n(1587.82, 1597.46)  merciful Father on behalf of the church and the world. For the church, may God\n(1597.46, 1603.02)  provide her the spiritual gifts she needs for her work of evangelization. We\n(1603.02, 1607.9)  pray to the Lord. Lord hear our prayer. For all who govern the nations of the\n(1607.9, 1613.66)  world, may the Holy Spirit fill them with wisdom, courage, and prudence. We pray to\n(1613.66, 1619.06)  to the Lord. Lord, hear our prayer. For this faith community, may the grace of\n(1619.06, 1623.66)  the sacraments increase our love for the Lord and for each other. We pray to the\n(1623.66, 1629.98)  Lord. Lord, hear our prayer. For all who are burdened with emotional, spiritual, or\n(1629.98, 1635.54)  bodily struggles, may God grant them healing and renewal. We pray to the Lord.\n(1635.54, 1642.22)  Lord, hear our prayer. For all who have died in light of faith, especially Joseph\n(1642.22, 1647.14)  Hamilton for whom this mass is offered for Claire O'Rourke and for all of our\n(1647.14, 1651.42)  deceased relatives friends and parishioners that they may find their\n(1651.42, 1655.7)  true home in the heavenly city with all who have gone before them on the path\n(1655.7, 1662.86)  to eternal life we pray to the Lord Lord hear our prayer may the silent prayers\n(1662.86, 1669.98)  in our hearts be lifted up to God who knows our needs even before we ask\n(1672.22, 1679.42)  we pray to the Lord. Lord, hear our prayer. Merciful Father, hear our prayers.\n(1679.42, 1684.38)  We ask them through Christ our Lord.\n(1687.66, 1697.02)  Our preparation song is number 438, Come Down O Love Divine, number 438.\n(1702.22, 1721.22)  Come down, O Love divine, seek thou this soul of mine,\n(1721.22, 1731.22)  and visit it with thine own order, glory.\n(1731.22, 1744.7)  Oh, comforted, run near, live in my heart of fear,\n(1744.7, 1755.66)  and kindle it, thy holy flame be strong in.\n(1755.66, 1769.66)  O, let it freely burn till earthly passions turn\n(1769.66, 1779.66)  to dust and ashes in its heat consuming,\n(1779.66, 1793.14)  And let thy glorious light shine ever on my sight,\n(1793.14, 1799.1)  and clothe me round, though while my path illuming.\n(1806.14, 1809.38)  Pray, my sisters and brothers, that my sacrifice\n(1809.38, 1813.38)  and yours may be acceptable to God, the Almighty Father.\n(1813.38, 1815.38)  May the Lord accept the sacrifice\n(1815.38, 1818.38)  and the praise and glory of His name,\n(1818.38, 1820.38)  for our good and the good of all His Holy Church.\n(1820.38, 1824.38)  Graciously sanctify these gifts, O Lord, we pray,\n(1824.38, 1828.38)  and accepting the oblation of this spiritual sacrifice,\n(1828.38, 1831.38)  make us an eternal offering to you\n(1831.38, 1834.38)  through Christ our Lord.\n(1834.38, 1835.38)  The Lord be with you.\n(1835.38, 1836.38)  And with your spirit.\n(1836.38, 1837.38)  Lift up your hearts.\n(1837.38, 1838.38)  And lift them up to the Lord.\n(1838.38, 1845.5)  Let us give thanks to the Lord our God. It is truly right and just, our duty and\n(1845.5, 1851.42)  our salvation, always and everywhere to give you thanks, Lord, Holy Father, Almighty\n(1851.42, 1856.78)  and Eternal God. For you laid the foundations of the world and have\n(1856.78, 1862.06)  arranged the changing of times and seasons. You formed us in your own image\n(1862.06, 1867.76)  and set us over the whole world in all its wonder. To rule in\n(1867.76, 1872.56)  your name over all that you have made, and forever praise you in your mighty\n(1872.56, 1878.72)  works through Christ our Lord. And so with the Angels we praise you, as in\n(1878.72, 1882.84)  joyful celebration we acclaim.\n(1897.76, 1905.76)  and earth are full of your glory.\n(1905.76, 1910.76)  Hosanna in the highest.\n(1910.76, 1915.76)  Hosanna in the highest.\n(1915.76, 1925.76)  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.\n(1925.76, 1930.76)  Hosanna in the highest.\n(1930.76, 1937.76)  Hosanna in the highest.\n(1943.76, 1947.76)  You are indeed holy, O Lord, the fount of all holiness.\n(1947.76, 1950.76)  Make holy, therefore, these gifts, we pray,\n(1950.76, 1954.76)  by sending down your Spirit upon them like the dewfall,\n(1954.76, 1961.42)  that they may become for us the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ. At the\n(1961.42, 1966.74)  time he was betrayed and entered willingly into his passion, he took bread\n(1966.74, 1974.06)  and giving thanks, broke it, and gave it to his disciples saying take this all of\n(1974.06, 1982.26)  you and eat of it, for this is my body which will be given up for you.\n(1984.76, 1997.2)  In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took the chalice, and once more giving thanks,\n(1997.2, 2004.48)  he gave it to his disciples, saying, Take this, all of you, and drink from it. For this\n(2004.48, 2010.72)  is the chalice of my blood, the blood of the new and eternal covenant, which will be poured\n(2010.72, 2017.72)  out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Do this in memory of me.\n(2040.72, 2057.36)  drink this cup we proclaim your death, O Lord, until you come again.\n(2057.36, 2063.04)  Therefore, as we celebrate the memorial of his death and resurrection, we offer you, Lord,\n(2063.04, 2069.52)  the bread of life and the chalice of salvation, giving thanks that you have held us worthy\n(2069.52, 2076.4)  to be in your presence and minister to you. Humbly we pray that partaking of the body and\n(2076.4, 2084.32)  blood of Christ we may be gathered into one by the Holy Spirit. Remember Lord your Church\n(2084.32, 2091.6)  spread throughout the world and bring her to the fullness of charity together with Leo our Pope,\n(2091.6, 2099.12)  Richard our Bishop and all who minister in your Church. Remember also our brothers and sisters\n(2099.52, 2104.56)  who have fallen asleep in the hope of the resurrection and all who have died\n(2104.56, 2112.32)  in your mercy. Welcome them into the light of your face. Have mercy on us all,\n(2112.32, 2117.36)  we pray, that with the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God and Gate of Heaven,\n(2117.36, 2124.08)  with blessed Joseph her spouse, with the blessed Apostles, St. Brigid, St. Augustine,\n(2124.08, 2130.32)  and all the saints who have pleased you throughout the ages. We may merit to be\n(2130.32, 2136.84)  co-heirs to eternal life, and may praise and glorify you through your Son Jesus Christ.\n(2136.84, 2150.16)  Through him and with him and in him, O God Almighty Father, in the unity\n(2150.16, 2162.16)  of the Holy Spirit, all glory and honor is Yours, forever and ever.\n(2165.16, 2178.16)  Amen. Amen. Amen.\n(2180.16, 2189.2)  At the Saviour's command and formed by divine teaching we dare to say, Our Father\n(2189.2, 2195.96)  who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done on\n(2195.96, 2202.04)  earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our\n(2202.04, 2208.32)  trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us and lead us not into\n(2208.32, 2214.72)  temptation but deliver us from evil. Deliver us Lord we pray from every evil,\n(2214.72, 2221.0)  graciously grant peace in our days that by the help of your mercy we may be\n(2221.0, 2227.28)  always free from sin and safe from all distress as we await the blessed hope\n(2227.28, 2232.32)  and the coming of our Savior Jesus Christ.\n(2234.8, 2232.32) \n(2235.52, 2238.76)  Lord Jesus Christ, who said to your apostles, peace I leave you, my peace I give you.\n(2238.76, 2242.92)  Look not on our sins, but on the faith of your church,\n(2242.92, 2246.12)  and graciously grant her peace and unity\n(2246.12, 2248.72)  in accordance with your will,\n(2248.72, 2251.12)  who live and reign forever and ever.\n(2251.12, 2252.72)  Amen.\n(2252.72, 2254.92)  In the silence of our hearts,\n(2254.92, 2256.92)  let us pray for peace.\n(2262.32, 2274.32)  The peace of the Lord be with you always, and with your spirit.\n(2274.32, 2278.32)  Let us offer each other the sign of peace.\n(2278.32, 2280.32)  Kevin, peace with you.\n(2292.32, 2312.32)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(2312.32, 2327.52)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(2327.52, 2338.24)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world,\n(2338.24, 2348.64)  Grant us peace, grant us peace.\n(2354.64, 2361.6)  Behold the Lamb of God, behold him who takes away the sins of the world.\n(2361.6, 2365.92)  Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb.\n(2365.92, 2370.12)  Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof,\n(2370.12, 2373.12)  but only say the word and my soul shall be healed.\n(2425.92, 2451.84)  He shall feed his flock like a shepherd and he shall guard his\n(2451.84, 2469.3)  We shall gather the lamb's wreath is our, wreath is our.\n(2476.3, 2481.78)  We shall feed his flock.\n(2481.78, 2502.24)  like a shepherd, and he shall gather the lambs with his arm,\n(2502.24, 2506.22)  with his arm.\n(2511.78, 2539.78)  And carry them in his bull's arm And gently lead those at our we've young\n(2539.78, 2557.78)  And gently lead, and gently lead those that are with yon.\n(2569.78, 2590.78)  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come\n(2590.78, 2593.78)  on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come\n(2593.78, 2594.78)  on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come\n(2594.78, 2595.78)  on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come\n(2595.78, 2596.78)  on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come\n(2596.78, 2597.78)  on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come\n(2597.78, 2598.78)  on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come\n(2598.78, 2603.28)  We'll give you rest.\n(2610.28, 2616.28)  Come on, don't wake me.\n(2616.78, 2621.28)  Find me that way.\n(2623.28, 2628.28)  Come on, don't wake me.\n(2628.78, 2642.78)  He that I believe in, and he will give you rest.\n(2648.78, 2642.78) \n(2667.76, 2691.76)  Take his yoke upon you, and learn of him, for he is weak, and lowly of heart, and ye shall find rest, and ye shall find rest unto your soul.\n(2697.76, 2711.72)  Take his look upon you, and hear that of him.\n(2711.72, 2724.7)  Thy name is holy as the glory of God.\n(2724.7, 2738.68)  Any nation thine best, any nation thine best,\n(2738.68, 2748.68)  and joyous o'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.\n(2768.68, 2783.8)  O sacrament, most holy, O sacrament divine, all praise and all thanksgiving, be every\n(2783.8, 2787.12)  moment thine.\n(2787.12, 2791.14)  Vanity of vanities, says the preacher.\n(2791.14, 2798.6)  To be truly rich is to know yourself, to know yourself in the light of God's mercy and\n(2798.6, 2807.28)  love. To be rich is desire to grow and to use your talents in the service of others,\n(2807.28, 2815.94)  particularly the poor. To be rich is to know failure, but also to have the courage to start\n(2815.94, 2825.08)  again with God's help. O Sacrament Most Holy, O Sacrament Divine,\n(2825.08, 2845.74)  All praise and all thanksgiving be every moment thine.\n(2845.74, 2850.32)  Let us pray.\n(2850.32, 2855.64)  with constant protection, O Lord, those you renew with these heavenly gifts, and\n(2855.64, 2861.36)  in your never-failing care for them, make them worthy of eternal redemption\n(2861.36, 2867.52)  through Christ our Lord. I hope you all have a blessed Sunday wherever it leads\n(2867.52, 2875.88)  you. The Lord be with you. May Almighty God bless you, the Father, the Son, and the\n(2875.88, 2884.28)  Holy Spirit go forth proclaiming the Lord with your lives our closing song is\n(2884.28, 2902.16)  number 446 number 4 4 6 the church's one foundation\n(2902.16, 2912.14)  The church's one foundation is Jesus Christ, our Lord.\n(2912.14, 2921.62)  Jesus' new creation, thy water and the word.\n(2921.62, 2931.1)  From heaven he came and sought her, to his holy bride.\n(2931.1, 2941.6)  With his own blood he bought her, and for her life he died.\n(2941.6, 2951.1)  Elect of every nation, yet one o'er all the earth,\n(2951.1, 2960.6)  Her charter of salvation, one Lord, one faith, one birth,\n(2960.6, 2970.6)  One holy name she blesses, Artic's one holy food.\n(2970.6, 2981.6)  When to one hope she presses With every grace and dude.\n(2990.6, 2992.6)  .\n(3020.6, 3022.6)  you\n(3050.6, 3052.6)  .\n(3080.6, 3082.6)  .\n(3110.6, 3112.6)  Thank you for joining us today, and we'll see you next time.\n(3258.6, 3265.6)  So, thank you very much for your attention and I look forward to seeing you again soon.\n",

I confess to Almighty God and to you my\n(345.3, 350.98)  brothers and sisters that I have greatly sinned in my thoughts and in my words in\n(350.98, 356.02)  what I have done and what I have failed to do through my fault through my fault\n(356.02, 360.58)  through my most grievous fault therefore I ask the Blessed Mary ever\n(360.58, 366.7)  Virgin all the angels and saints and you my brothers and sisters to pray for me\n(366.7, 371.82)  the Lord our God may Almighty God have mercy on us forgive us our sins and\n(371.82, 382.14)  bring us to everlasting life Lord have mercy Christ have mercy Lord have mercy\n(396.7, 405.7)  We praise you, we bless you, we adore you, we glorify you,\n(405.7, 415.7)  We give you thanks for your great glory, Lord God and great being,\n(415.7, 432.18)  O God, Almighty Father, Lord Jesus Christ, only begotten Son,\n(432.18, 441.68)  Lord God, Lamb of God, Son of the Father,\n(441.68, 448.68)  you take away the sins of the world.\n(448.68, 454.18)  Have mercy on us.\n(454.18, 461.18)  You take away the sins of the world.\n(461.18, 467.18)  Receive our prayer.\n(467.18, 477.18)  You are seated at the right hand of the Father.\n(477.18, 486.18)  Have mercy on us.\n(486.18, 490.18)  For you alone are the only one.\n(490.18, 495.18)  You alone are the Lord.\n(495.18, 500.18)  You alone are the Most High.\n(500.18, 505.18)  Jesus Christ, with the Holy Spirit,\n(505.18, 510.18)  in the glory of God the Father.\n(510.18, 519.18)  Amen.\n(519.18, 527.7)  Let us pray. Draw near to your servants, O Lord, and answer their prayers with\n(527.7, 532.26)  unceasing kindness, that for those who glory in you as their creator and guide,\n(532.26, 536.98)  you may restore what you have created and keep safe what you have restored\n(536.98, 541.62)  through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you in the\n(541.62, 546.7)  unity of the Holy Spirit, God forever and ever.\n(549.18, 578.18)  a reading from the book of Ecclesiastes.\n(579.18, 587.06)  Vanity of vanities, says Kohalit, vanity of vanities, all things are vanity.\n(588.5, 594.58)  Here is one who is labored with wisdom and knowledge and skill, and yet to another\n(594.58, 598.1)  who is not labored over it, he must leave property.\n(599.46, 603.34)  This also is vanity and a great misfortune.\n(604.38, 603.34) \n(610.34, 611.34)  For what profit comes to man from all the toil and anxiety of heart with which he has\n(618.34, 621.34)  labored under the sun? All his days, sorrow, and grief is his occupation. Even at night,\n(628.34, 633.34)  his mind is not at rest. This also is vanity.\" The word of the Lord.\n(660.34, 666.98)  If today you hear his voice, harden not your hearts.\n(666.98, 674.1)  If today you hear his voice,\n(674.1, 680.9)  harden not your hearts.\n(680.9, 685.22)  You turn man back to dust,\n(685.22, 697.22)  Sing, return, O children of men, For a thousand years are in your sight,\n(697.22, 710.42)  As yesterday, now that it is past, Or as a watch of the night.\n(710.42, 717.58)  If today you hear his voice,\n(717.58, 724.58)  harden not your arms.\n(724.58, 729.54)  You make an end of them in their sleep.\n(729.54, 735.86)  The next morning they are like the changing grass,\n(735.86, 747.7)  which at dawn springs upon you, but by evening wilts and fades.\n(747.7, 762.34)  If today you hear his voice, harden not your arms.\n(762.34, 772.18)  Teach us to number our days aright that we may gain wisdom of heart.\n(772.18, 783.62)  Return, O Lord, our Lord, a pity on your servants.\n(783.62, 797.62)  If today you hear his voice, harden not your hearts.\n(797.62, 802.62)  Fill us at daybreak with your kindness,\n(802.62, 809.62)  that we may shout for joy and gladness all our days.\n(809.62, 818.32)  And may the gracious care of the Lord our God be ours,\n(818.32, 823.42)  prosper the work of our hands for us,\n(823.42, 829.22)  prosper the work of our hands.\n(829.22, 836.82)  If today you hear His voice,\n(836.82, 843.82)  Harden not your hearts.\n(863.1, 866.54)  A reading from the letter of St. Paul to the Colossians.\n(866.82, 875.42)  Brothers and sisters, if you were raised with Christ, seek what is above, where Christ is\n(875.42, 878.98)  seated at the right hand of God.\n(878.98, 886.3)  Think of what is above, not of what is on earth, for you have died and your life is\n(886.3, 889.54)  hidden with Christ in God.\n(889.54, 896.78)  When Christ your life appears, then you too will appear with Him in glory.\n(896.78, 906.08)  Look to death, then, the parts of you that are earthly\u2014immorality, impurity, passion,\n(906.08, 911.68)  evil desire, and the greed that is idolatry.\n(911.68, 918.88)  Stop lying to one another, since you have taken off the old self with its practices\n(918.88, 925.38)  and have put on the new self, which is being renewed for knowledge in the image of its\n(925.38, 935.06)  creator. Here, there is not Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian,\n(935.06, 943.86)  Scythian, slave, free, but Christ is all and in all. The word of the Lord.\n(955.38, 978.38)  Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia, alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.\n(978.38, 983.38)  Blessed are the poor in spirit,\n(983.38, 989.86)  For theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\n(989.86, 996.34)  Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.\n(1002.3, 1004.7)  The Lord be with you.\n(1004.7, 1006.98)  A reading from the Holy Gospel according to Luke.\n(1010.42, 1006.98) \n(1015.28, 1021.56)  someone in the crowd said to Jesus teacher tell my brother to share the inheritance with me he replied to him friend who appointed me as your judge an\n(1021.56, 1028.04)  arbitrator then he said to the crowd take care to guard against all greed for\n(1028.04, 1033.2)  though one may be rich one's life does not consist of possessions then he told\n(1033.2, 1039.32)  them a parable. There was a rich man, whose land produced a bountiful harvest. He asked\n(1039.32, 1045.78)  himself, What shall I do? For I do not have space to store my harvest. And he said, This\n(1045.78, 1051.76)  is what I shall do. I shall tear down my barns and build larger ones. There I shall store\n(1051.76, 1057.98)  all my grain and other goods, and I shall say to myself, Now, as for you, you have so\n(1057.98, 1065.38)  many good things stored up for many years. Rest, eat, drink, be merry. But God\n(1065.38, 1070.9)  said to him, you fool, this night your life will be demanded of you, and the\n(1070.9, 1076.18)  things you have prepared, to whom will they belong? Thus will it be for all who\n(1076.18, 1082.22)  store up treasure for themselves, but are not rich in what matters to God. The\n(1082.22, 1085.22)  gospel of the Lord.\n(1087.98, 1104.98)  This coming week is the last week of summer camp at our school, and I give our teachers so much credit because they've been chasing around a bunch of rambunctious kids for all summer, and I know that they're getting tired and they deserve a much-needed break.\n(1104.98, 1111.62)  I always know that they're reaching their end of the day when I see the bubbles come out.\n(1112.22, 1117.22)  Because they start blowing the bubbles and then the three and four-year-old kids are completely\n(1117.7, 1120.46)  captivated and they're chasing these bubbles around\n(1121.26, 1123.26)  endlessly, even though\n(1123.44, 1128.56)  they know, well, they don't know, but we all know they're never going to be able to grab the bubble.\n(1128.56, 1131.58)  It just floats away or it pops as soon as they touch it.\n(1131.58, 1137.2)  And it's funny because the six- and seven-year-olds, or the older kids, are not really amused by\n(1137.2, 1138.2)  this.\n(1138.2, 1145.5)  I share this with you because in our first reading in the book of Ecclesiastes, the word\n(1145.5, 1158.06)  for vanity in Hebrew is hevel, which actually means air or breath, air or breath.\n(1158.06, 1164.66)  And this is such a critical point, because what the author is saying, is everything in\n(1164.66, 1174.14)  the earth, even the good things, at the end of the day, is just air.\n(1174.14, 1180.94)  It comes and goes, and we can never really grab it.\n(1180.94, 1185.88)  Brothers and sisters, we're really no different than those three and four year olds running\n(1185.88, 1196.72)  after the bubbles. We're chasing air all the time. Wealth. Pleasure. Honor. Prestige.\n(1196.72, 1204.76)  Relationships. Influence. Whatever it is, though many of those things are good, if they\n(1204.76, 1219.24)  become our be-all end-all will never be satisfied because it's air, it comes and it goes.\n(1219.24, 1227.6)  So many of our young people especially are slaves to work, the rat race, climbing the\n(1227.6, 1234.72)  career ladder, oh I can't do anything else because I've got to work, or sports, again\n(1234.72, 1241.02)  another great thing, a true passion of mine, but sometimes our pews are empty because we're\n(1241.02, 1251.44)  chasing sports. It's all air. Our Lord says, what does it profit a man to gain the whole\n(1251.44, 1262.04)  world but lose his soul? You see, our readings today bring us to the center of the spiritual\n(1262.04, 1266.0)  life, which is detachment.\n(1266.0, 1271.56)  We have to hold on to all of the goods of this world loosely.\n(1271.56, 1275.84)  We cannot see them as the ends in themselves,\n(1275.84, 1280.52)  because they'll never truly satisfy.\n(1280.52, 1282.58)  Saint Augustine so brilliantly said,\n(1282.58, 1286.12)  our hearts are restless until they rest in thee, God.\n(1286.12, 1287.32)  Why?\n(1287.32, 1290.52)  Because we have this infinite capacity for love\n(1290.52, 1292.66)  and for permanency.\n(1292.66, 1295.86)  And everything else that we try to fill it with\n(1295.86, 1298.02)  is just air.\n(1299.22, 1302.4)  God wants to give us so much more.\n(1304.4, 1307.1)  To be with God, to have a relationship with him,\n(1307.1, 1309.02)  to be captivated with him in heaven,\n(1310.4, 1315.4)  is to understand that nothing here really truly satisfies.\n(1316.46, 1318.78)  And that doesn't make it bad,\n(1318.78, 1321.82)  but it can't captivate completely.\n(1321.82, 1326.0)  How can God give us what he truly wants,\n(1326.0, 1328.06)  what we truly desire,\n(1328.06, 1332.18)  if we're so fixated on chasing the air?\n(1332.18, 1334.06)  If we think all we need\n(1334.06, 1337.16)  is just a little bit more success and work,\n(1338.46, 1340.88)  or just a little bit more pleasure,\n(1342.94, 1345.48)  we could always have more of these things.\n(1346.82, 1345.48) \n(1352.48, 1356.48)  It's so easy to fall into this trap of chasing the air back to the bubble. I do it all the time.\n(1356.48, 1362.48)  And so, our Lord says we have to prioritize different things.\n(1362.48, 1371.48)  In fact, Jesus says when we chase these things, we're being foolish.\n(1371.48, 1373.48)  We're being very foolish.\n(1373.48, 1377.48)  And he's not saying this because he's trying to condemn us.\n(1377.48, 1383.48)  He's trying to get us to see that this is a road, this is a race we cannot win.\n(1383.48, 1386.48)  And so what is the answer?\n(1386.48, 1391.48)  As Saint Paul says, we need to seek what is above.\n(1391.48, 1397.48)  We've died to this old self and in our baptism we've been born new.\n(1397.48, 1400.48)  And so that we seek eternal realities.\n(1400.48, 1404.76)  To seek something means to pursue it with fire and persistence\n(1405.52, 1409.62)  To pursue God to make him a top priority in our life\n(1411.0, 1413.0)  Just to bring this home. I\n(1413.96, 1420.72)  Think many of us would accurately describe if someone said are you rich we would say no and for many of us\n(1420.72, 1421.6)  That's very true\n(1421.6, 1425.64)  And so then we have a good in order desire to work hard\n(1425.76, 1430.16)  So we can provide for those that we care about and that's a very very good thing\n(1430.48, 1438.82)  But when it comes to our spiritual lives, our relationship with God, I know for me,\n(1438.82, 1445.08)  I often say things, you know what, I'm doing okay.\n(1445.08, 1451.54)  I mean, I'm a priest, I got some faith, some hope, I try to be good to people.\n(1451.54, 1454.44)  I'm good enough.\n(1454.44, 1462.82)  But Jesus says we need to be rich in what matters to God.\n(1462.82, 1471.02)  To be rich in what matters to God means to be rich in what's eternal, what actually lasts.\n(1471.02, 1477.08)  And St. Paul says those three things are faith, hope, and love.\n(1477.08, 1479.98)  And the greatest of these is love.\n(1479.98, 1483.08)  And so we shouldn't say I have enough faith.\n(1483.08, 1485.72)  We should say, no, Lord, increase my faith.\n(1485.72, 1487.68)  I want to be rich in faith.\n(1487.68, 1489.86)  I want to be rich in hope.\n(1489.86, 1491.88)  I want to be rich in love,\n(1491.88, 1495.66)  so that when I pursue these with fire and persistence,\n(1495.66, 1500.66)  everyone around me says, I want to live like that,\n(1502.4, 1504.86)  because I'm sick of running after the air,\n(1506.08, 1507.8)  because it doesn't fill.\n(1510.04, 1512.44)  Saint Ignatius of Loyola says this\n(1512.44, 1514.54)  in his beautiful prayer, the sushi pay,\n(1514.54, 1516.04)  the take and receive prayer.\n(1516.04, 1521.04)  He says, Lord, give me only your love and your grace.\n(1522.6, 1526.88)  Then I will be rich enough and desire nothing more.\n(1529.12, 1533.08)  It's only the love of God that's eternal\n(1533.08, 1534.92)  and truly satisfies.\n(1535.8, 1540.8)  Do we ask to be rich in these?\n(1540.84, 1542.12)  Because at the end of the day,\n(1542.12, 1545.8)  and everything else is just air.\n(1559.24, 1562.04)  And so let us stand and profess our faith.\n(1563.84, 1567.0)  I believe in one God, the Father Almighty,\n(1567.0, 1568.76)  maker of heaven and earth,\n(1568.76, 1571.26)  of all things visible and invisible.\n(1571.26, 1573.64)  I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ,\n(1573.64, 1575.76)  the only begotten Son of God,\n(1575.76, 1578.16)  born of the Father before all ages,\n(1578.16, 1582.1)  God from God, light from light, true God from true God,\n(1582.1, 1585.2)  begot not made consubstantial with the Father.\n(1585.2, 1587.24)  Through him all things were made.\n(1587.24, 1589.2)  For us men and for our salvation,\n(1589.2, 1592.12)  he came down from heaven and by the Holy Spirit\n(1592.12, 1595.32)  was incarnate of the Virgin Mary and became man.\n(1595.32, 1598.36)  For our sake he was crucified under conscious pilot,\n(1598.36, 1600.44)  he suffered death and was buried,\n(1600.44, 1602.08)  and rose again on the third day\n(1602.08, 1604.0)  in accordance with the scriptures.\n(1604.0, 1605.36)  He ascended into heaven\n(1605.36, 1607.76)  and is seated at the right hand of the Father.\n(1607.76, 1610.92)  He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead\n(1610.92, 1613.02)  and his kingdom will have no end.\n(1613.02, 1616.76)  I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,\n(1616.76, 1619.26)  who proceeds from the Father and the Son,\n(1619.26, 1622.2)  who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified,\n(1622.2, 1624.28)  who has spoken through the prophets.\n(1624.28, 1628.26)  I believe in one holy Catholic and apostolic church.\n(1628.26, 1631.66)  I confess one baptism for the forgiveness of sins,\n(1631.66, 1634.22)  and I look forward to the resurrection of the dead\n(1634.22, 1637.1)  and the life of the world to come, amen.\n(1637.1, 1639.86)  Turning towards our Heavenly Father with great confidence,\n(1639.86, 1641.86)  we make our petitions known to Him.\n(1643.9, 1646.98)  Father Church, may God provide her\n(1646.98, 1649.42)  with the spiritual gifts she needs\n(1649.42, 1653.4)  for her work of evangelization, we pray to the Lord.\n(1653.4, 1655.46)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1655.46, 1658.86)  For all who govern the

Lord Jesus Christ,\n(448.6, 458.6)  who may be not in song, Lord God of our own,\n(458.6, 469.58)  Son of the Father, you take away the sins of the world.\n(469.58, 475.06)  Have mercy on us.\n(475.06, 482.06)  You take away the sins of the world.\n(482.06, 485.54)  Receive our prayer.\n(488.6, 496.6)  You are seated at the right hand of the Father,\n(496.6, 505.6)  the mercy of us.\n(505.6, 510.6)  For you are the Lord, the Holy One,\n(510.6, 515.6)  you are the Lord,\n(515.6, 536.48)  You are the All-Star, carry this praise with the Holy Spirit in the glory of the Father, Amen.\n(537.92, 538.72)  Let us pray.\n(540.8, 538.72) \n(544.96, 550.08)  draw near to your servants O Lord and answer their prayers with unceasing kindness that for those who glory in you as their creator and guide you may\n(550.08, 554.82)  restore what you have created and keep safe what you have restored you are Lord\n(554.82, 558.98)  Jesus Christ your son who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy\n(558.98, 562.14)  the Holy Spirit, God forever and ever.\n(568.4, 571.34)  A reading from the book of Ecclesiastes.\n(571.34, 575.76)  Vanity of vanities, says Choloth, vanity of vanities,\n(575.76, 577.6)  all things are vanity.\n(578.52, 581.6)  Here is one who is labored with wisdom and knowledge\n(581.6, 585.7)  and skill, and yet to another who has not labored over it,\n(585.7, 588.08)  he must leave property.\n(588.08, 591.38)  This also is vanity and a great misfortune.\n(591.38, 594.32)  For what profit comes to man from all the toil\n(594.32, 596.92)  and anxiety of the heart with which he is labored\n(596.92, 598.82)  under the sun?\n(598.82, 602.32)  All his days, sorrow and grief is his occupation.\n(602.32, 605.36)  Even at night, his mind is not at rest.\n(605.36, 608.86)  This also is vanity, the word of the Lord.\n(612.0, 608.86) \n(615.86, 622.86)  If today you hear my voice, If today you hear my voice, If today you hear my voice, If today you hear my voice,\n(622.86, 629.86)  If today you hear my voice, If today you hear my voice,\n(629.86, 636.86)  If today you hear my voice, If today you hear my voice,\n(636.86, 648.34)  If today you hear his voice, harden not your hearts.\n(648.34, 661.82)  If today you hear his voice, harden not your hearts.\n(661.82, 667.26)  You turn man back to dust, saying,\n(667.26, 672.26)  Return, O children of men.\n(672.26, 680.22)  For a thousand years are in your sight, or as yesterday,\n(680.22, 690.7)  now that it is past, or as a watch of the night.\n(690.7, 703.18)  If today you hear his voice, harden not your hearts.\n(703.18, 708.38)  You make an end of them in their sleep.\n(708.38, 714.62)  The next morning they are like the changing grass,\n(714.62, 719.98)  which at dawn spring on you.\n(719.98, 733.52)  But my evening wills and fears, If today you hear his voice,\n(733.52, 745.02)  Pardon, God, your voice, Teach us to number our days aright,\n(745.02, 750.9)  that we be gain wisdom, O Lord.\n(750.9, 756.5)  Return, O Lord, our own,\n(756.5, 763.04)  the pity on your servants.\n(763.04, 769.92)  Gave to thee, you hear his voice,\n(769.92, 776.16)  Lord, in God your hearts.\n(776.16, 781.52)  Fill us at daybreak with your kindness,\n(781.52, 789.12)  that we may shout for joy and gladness all our days.\n(789.12, 797.52)  And may the gracious care of the Lord, our godly ours,\n(797.52, 802.72)  prosper the work of our hands for us,\n(802.72, 808.72)  prosper the work of our hands.\n(808.72, 815.68)  If today you hear his voice,\n(815.68, 822.48)  you are denied yours.\n(827.52, 838.92)  A reading from the letter of Saint Paul to the Colossians.\n(838.92, 844.6)  Brothers and sisters, if you are raised with Christ, seek what is above, where Christ is\n(844.6, 847.36)  seated at the right hand of God.\n(847.36, 852.32)  Think of what is above, not of what is on earth, for you have died and your life is\n(852.32, 854.9)  hidden with Christ in God.\n(854.9, 860.26)  When Christ your life appears, then you too will appear with Him in glory.\n(860.26, 867.3)  Put to death, then, the parts of you that are earthly, immorality, impurity, passion,\n(867.3, 873.78)  evil desire, and the greed that is idolatry, stop lying to one another, since you have\n(873.78, 879.5)  taken off the old self with its practices, and have put on the new self, which is being\n(879.5, 883.86)  renewed for knowledge in the image of its Creator.\n(883.86, 891.1)  Here there is not Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian and Scythian,\n(891.1, 896.58)  slave, free, but Christ is all and in all, the word of the Lord.\n(913.86, 926.86)  Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.\n(926.86, 931.86)  Blessed are the poor in spirit,\n(931.86, 938.86)  for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\n(938.86, 942.86)  Alleluia, Alleluia,\n(942.86, 958.24)  The Lord be with you. A reading from the Holy Gospel according to Luke. Someone in\n(958.24, 963.5)  the crowd said to Jesus, Teacher, tell my brother to share the inheritance with me.\n(963.5, 970.14)  He replied to him, Friend, who appointed me as your judge and arbitrator? Then he\n(970.14, 974.24)  And he said to the crowd, take care to guard against all greed,\n(974.24, 979.14)  for though one may be rich, one's life does not consist of possessions.\n(979.14, 981.14)  Then he told them a parable.\n(981.14, 984.64)  There is a rich man whose land produced a bountiful harvest.\n(984.64, 987.44)  He asked himself, what shall I do?\n(987.44, 990.24)  For I do not have space to store my harvest.\n(990.24, 993.14)  And he said, this is what I shall do.\n(993.14, 996.44)  I shall tear down my barns and build larger ones.\n(996.44, 999.34)  There I shall store all my grain and other goods,\n(999.34, 1002.38)  I shall say to myself, now as for you,\n(1002.38, 1005.42)  you have so many good things stored up for many years.\n(1005.42, 1009.08)  Rest, eat, drink, be merry.\n(1009.08, 1012.14)  But God said to him, you fool,\n(1012.14, 1014.58)  this night your life will be demanded of you\n(1014.58, 1018.36)  and the things you have prepared, to whom will they belong?\n(1018.36, 1020.56)  Thus will it be for all who store up treasure\n(1020.56, 1025.12)  for themselves, but are not rich in what matters to God.\n(1025.12, 1026.64)  The gospel of the Lord.\n(1029.34, 1038.06)  This is the last week of the summer camp at our school and the teachers who have done\n(1038.06, 1042.78)  a wonderful job, you can tell they're also very much ready for a break.\n(1042.78, 1047.44)  And one of their tactics to keep the kids entertained, especially the three and four\n(1047.44, 1053.12)  year olds, and I know we've had a long day when I see this, is they break out the bubbles.\n(1053.12, 1057.1)  And they start blowing the bubbles and it keeps these three and four year old kids entertained\n(1057.1, 1059.74)  because they chase them endlessly,\n(1059.74, 1062.54)  and even though they're never going to grab the bubble,\n(1062.54, 1065.5)  it keeps them totally preoccupied.\n(1065.5, 1069.66)  It's also funny because if you watch the six or seven year olds,\n(1069.66, 1071.74)  they're not really amused by this,\n(1071.74, 1077.46)  because they know that those bubbles are just going to float away.\n(1077.46, 1082.7)  I share this with you because the Hebrew word for vanity,\n(1082.7, 1087.02)  which is used in the first reading in the book of Ecclesiastes,\n(1087.02, 1092.02)  is hevel, which means breath or air.\n(1092.9, 1095.14)  And this is a really important point\n(1095.14, 1097.66)  because the author is saying\n(1097.66, 1101.8)  that everything we pursue in life on this earth,\n(1101.8, 1106.42)  even the good things at the end of the day,\n(1106.42, 1109.34)  it's just air.\n(1110.98, 1113.84)  It comes and it goes.\n(1115.74, 1113.84) \n(1123.84, 1134.84)  We are not much different than those 3- and 4-year-olds chasing after those bubbles that float away. We endlessly pursue wealth, pleasure, honor, prestige, relationships, you name it.\n(1134.84, 1140.84)  Anything that's bound to this earth is just air.\n(1140.84, 1149.72)  it floats away. So many of our young people especially are enslaved to their\n(1149.72, 1156.52)  work. They're tethered to their desks at the expense of a spiritual life or\n(1156.52, 1165.02)  relationship with God. A real spiritual poverty or even something another great\n(1165.02, 1174.3)  good of this earth, sports. Our pews are often empty because we're pursuing sports a great\n(1174.3, 1185.3)  thing, but at the end of the day, air, it floats away. That's why our readings, they\n(1185.3, 1194.78)  bring us to the heart of the spiritual life, and therefore a happy life, which is detachment.\n(1194.78, 1200.18)  We have to hold on to all of the goods of this world loosely.\n(1200.18, 1209.16)  We cannot see them as the be-all, end-all, because they pass away, and they can never\n(1209.16, 1212.12)  fully satisfy.\n(1212.12, 1215.4)  Our hearts are restless until they rest and be.\n(1215.4, 1223.1)  It's because we're made for something eternal, a relationship with God, heaven.\n(1223.1, 1232.4)  Think of it like this, how can God give us what we truly desire, an infinite relationship\n(1232.4, 1239.78)  with him that comes to its culmination in heaven, which does not pass away?\n(1239.78, 1248.06)  How can he give us that if we're so preoccupied and fixated and all we care about are those\n(1248.06, 1258.5)  bubbles the air what drifts away we all fall into this trap of pursuing things\n(1258.5, 1265.02)  of this earth of chasing them endlessly and as easy as it is to fall into this\n(1265.02, 1271.1)  that's why we have to hear the words of the gospel Jesus has a word to describe\n(1271.1, 1277.54)  a person ie you and me because I do this all the time who becomes so fixated\n(1277.54, 1285.7)  on these things that pass away and this is the word he uses, fool. He says you're\n(1285.7, 1293.98)  a fool because these things cannot satisfy. We could never have enough\n(1293.98, 1298.82)  pleasure. We could never have enough wealth. We could never have enough honor\n(1298.82, 1304.94)  and this is what it says in our first reading is why we can't rest at night.\n(1304.94, 1310.82)  Why we have to numb ourselves by just looking at our phones or whatever it is to distract\n(1310.82, 1316.88)  us because we will not listen to that voice that there must be something more.\n(1316.88, 1320.4)  There must be something more.\n(1320.4, 1330.78)  A peaceful life, a fulfilled life, is one that pursues the eternal realities, God, above\n(1330.78, 1332.8)  all else.\n(1332.8, 1334.52)  This is the remedy.\n(1334.52, 1340.24)  This is why St. Paul says you've died to that old self.\n(1340.24, 1342.28)  You've died to immorality.\n(1342.28, 1346.78)  You've died to the greed of idolatry, of lust, of all of these things that you've put on\n(1346.78, 1351.64)  a new self, and so seek what is above.\n(1351.64, 1353.0)  Seek what is above.\n(1353.0, 1356.4)  I'll end with this.\n(1356.4, 1359.0)  Just make it very practical.\n(1359.0, 1366.44)  I think many of us, if we were asked, are you rich, we would rightly say no, because\n(1366.44, 1371.92)  many of us are not, and so we have a good desire to make more money to provide, and\n(1371.92, 1379.28)  that is a good and ordered thing, and we're very accurate about where we stand financially.\n(1379.28, 1387.44)  But if someone asks you about your relationship with God, we're pretty quick to say, yeah,\n(1387.44, 1389.78)  I'm doing pretty well.\n(1389.78, 1391.18)  I got faith.\n(1391.18, 1393.26)  I got enough hope.\n(1393.26, 1394.26)  I'm a good person.\n(1394.26, 1396.86)  I don't really do anything wrong.\n(1396.86, 1399.9)  I'm good enough.\n(1399.9, 1405.66)  But Jesus says we're foolish unless we're\n(1405.66, 1410.1)  rich in what matters to God, unless we\n(1410.1, 1414.12)  have a surplus of faith, a surplus of hope,\n(1414.12, 1417.16)  a surplus of love.\n(1417.16, 1422.78)  So that it comes out of us and people see these eternal realities and they stop chasing\n(1422.78, 1430.06)  the air and they pursue what is ultimately real.\n(1430.06, 1435.18)  We would do well to reflect on am I rich in what matters to God.\n(1435.18, 1442.82)  Faith, hope, and love, Saint Paul says, are the three things that last, and the greatest\n(1442.82, 1446.5)  of these is love.\n(1446.5, 1450.3)  That's what we need to pursue.\n(1450.3, 1455.26)  St. Ignatius of Loyola in his famous prayer, the sushi pay prayer, take, O Lord, and receive,\n(1455.26, 1463.06)  he ends it with this, Lord, give me only your love and your grace.\n(1463.06, 1469.62)  Then I will be rich enough and desire nothing more.\n(1469.62, 1476.42)  Do we desire his love and his grace above the things of the earth?\n(1476.42, 1492.9)  Because at the end of the day, they're just air.\n(1492.9, 1497.38)  And so let us stand and profess our faith.\n(1497.38, 1503.24)  I believe in one God, the Father almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all things visible\n(1503.24, 1504.46)  and invisible.\n(1504.46, 1510.2)  I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, born of the Father before\n(1510.2, 1517.38)  all ages, God from God, light from light, true God from true God, begot not made consubstantial\n(1517.38, 1520.42)  with the Father, through him all things remain.\n(1520.42, 1525.74)  For us men and for our salvation he came down from heaven, and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate\n(1525.74, 1528.22)  of the Virgin Mary and became man.\n(1528.22, 1533.26)  For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate, he suffered death and was buried,\n(1533.26, 1534.94)  and rose again on the third day\n(1534.94, 1536.82)  in accordance with the scriptures.\n(1536.82, 1538.34)  He ascended into heaven\n(1538.34, 1540.66)  and is seated at the right hand of the Father.\n(1540.66, 1543.78)  He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead\n(1543.78, 1545.82)  and his kingdom will have no end.\n(1545.82, 1549.54)  I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,\n(1549.54, 1552.02)  who proceeds from the Father and the Son,\n(1552.02, 1555.06)  who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified,\n(1555.06, 1557.02)  who has spoken through the prophets.\n(1557.02, 1560.98)  I believe in one holy Catholic and apostolic church.\n(1560.98, 1564.26)  I confess one baptism for the forgiveness of sins,\n(1564.26, 1566.82)  and I look forward to the resurrection of the dead\n(1566.82, 1569.7)  and the life of the world to come, amen.\n(1569.7, 1572.42)  Turning towards our Heavenly Father with great confidence,\n(1572.42, 1574.82)  we make our petitions known to Him.\n(1574.82, 1576.98)  For the Church, may God provide her\n(1576.98, 1578.82)  with the spiritual gifts she needs\n(1578.82, 1582.14)  for her work of evangelization, we pray to the Lord.\n(1582.14, 1583.74)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1583.74, 1586.06)  For all who govern the nations around the world,\n(1586.06, 1587.26)  may the Holy Spirit fill them\n(1587.26, 1589.82)  with wisdom, courage, and prudence,\n(1589.82, 1591.34)  We pray to the Lord.\n(1591.34, 1592.66)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1592.66, 1594.3)  For this faith community,\n(1594.3, 1596.88)  may the grace of the sacraments increase our love\n(1596.88, 1598.98)  for the Lord and for each other.\n(1598.98, 1600.3)  We pray to the Lord.\n(1600.3, 1602.06)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1602.06, 1605.42)  For all who are burdened with emotional, spiritual,\n(1605.42, 1609.5)  or bodily struggles, may God grant them healing and renewal.\n(1609.5, 1610.88)  We pray to the Lord.\n(1610.88, 1612.5)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1612.5, 1614.62)  For all who have died in the light of faith,\n(1614.62, 1617.62)  especially our parishioners for whom this mass is offered,\n(1617.62, 1620.78)  for Claire O'Rourke, and for all of our deceased relatives,\n(1620.78, 1622.66)  friends, and parishioners.\n(1622.66, 1624.94)  They may find their true home in the heavenly city\n(1624.94, 1626.9)  with all who have gone before them\n(1626.9, 1628.7)  on the path to eternal life.\n(1628.7, 1630.02)  We pray to the Lord.\n(1630.02, 1631.74)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1631.74, 1634.54)  May the silent prayers in our hearts be lifted up to God,\n(1634.54, 1637.18)  who knows our needs even before we ask.\n(1640.38, 1641.7)  We pray to the Lord.\n(1641.7, 1643.34)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1643.34, 1646.42)  Heavenly Father, we make these prayers with great confidence\n(1646.42, 1648.68)  as we ask them through the intercession of Mary,\n(1648.68, 1650.64)  our morning star and gate of heaven,\n(1650.64, 1653.08)  and we speak them in the name of Jesus, her son,\n(1653.08, 1654.92)  who is Lord forever and ever.\n(1658.84, 1662.06)  Our preparation song is number 438.\n(1662.06, 1665.78)  Number 438, Come Down, O Love Divine.\n(1666.96, 1670.54)  [\"Come Down, O Love Divine\"]\n(1676.42, 1683.42)  of the land of the free and the home of the brave.\n(1683.42, 1685.42)  And the home of the brave.\n(1685.42, 1687.42)  And the home of the brave.\n(1687.42, 1689.42)  And the home of the brave.\n(1689.42, 1691.42)  And the home of the brave.\n(1691.42, 1693.42)  And the home of the brave.\n(1693.42, 1695.42)  And the home of the brave.\n(1695.42, 1697.42)  And the home of the brave.\n(1697.42, 1699.42)  And the home of the brave.\n(1699.42, 1701.42)  And the home of the brave.\n(1701.42, 1703.42)  And the home of the brave.\n(1703.42, 1705.42)  And the home of the brave.\n(1705.42, 1723.78)  O come, the dawn of the year, Within my heart I'll be you,\n(1723.78, 1734.14)  And kindle it, thy holy fame bestow me.\n(1734.14, 1746.62)  Oh, let it freely burn, till earthly passions turn.\n(1746.62, 1756.1)  True dust and ashes keep its heat on to me.\n(1756.1, 1769.1)  God, let my kindness light shine ever on my sight,\n(1769.1, 1780.1)  and gladly run while my body glory be.\n(1780.1, 1783.1)  Pray, brothers and sisters, that my sacrifice and yours\n(1783.1, 1785.1)  may be acceptable to God, the Almighty Father,\n(1785.1, 1798.46)  Almighty Father, graciously sanctify these gifts, O Lord, we pray, in accepting the oblation\n(1798.46, 1804.0)  of this spiritual sacrifice, make of us an eternal offering to you, through Christ our\n(1804.0, 1806.06)  Lord.\n(1806.06, 1814.88)  The Lord be with you, lift up your hearts, let us give thanks to the Lord our God, it\n(1814.88, 1819.6)  It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, always and everywhere to give you\n(1819.6, 1820.6)  thanks.\n(1820.6, 1824.46)  Lord, Holy Father, Almighty and Eternal God, through Christ our Lord.\n(1824.46, 1829.06)  For out of compassion for the waywardness that is ours, He humbled Himself and was born\n(1829.06, 1830.18)  of the Virgin.\n(1830.18, 1834.72)  By the passion of the cross He freed us from unending death, and by rising from the dead\n(1834.72, 1836.62)  He gave us life eternal.\n(1836.62, 1841.62)  And so with angels and archangels, with thrones and dominions, and with all the hosts and\n(1841.62, 1848.02)  powers of heaven, we sing the hymn of your glory, as without end we acclaim.\n(1871.62, 1878.62)  O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?\n(1878.62, 1885.62)  O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?\n(1885.62, 1892.62)  O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?\n(1892.62, 1899.62)  O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?\n(1901.62, 1908.36)  You are indeed holy O Lord and all you have created rightly gives you praise for through your son our Lord Jesus Christ\n(1908.72, 1915.42)  By the power and working of the Holy Spirit you give life to all things and make them holy and you never cease to gather\n(1915.42, 1922.26)  A people to yourself so that from the rising of the Sun to its setting a pure sacrifice may be offered to your name\n(1923.08, 1928.58)  Therefore O Lord we humbly implore you by the same spirit graciously make holy these gifts\n(1928.58, 1934.74)  we have brought to you for consecration, that they may become the body and blood of your Son,\n(1934.74, 1940.66)  our Lord Jesus Christ, at whose command we celebrate these mysteries. For on the night\n(1940.66, 1948.18)  he was betrayed, he himself took bread, and giving you thanks he said the blessing, broke the bread,\n(1948.18, 1956.26)  and gave it to his disciples saying take things all of you and eat of it\n(1956.26, 1963.38)  for this is my body which will be given up for you.\n(1976.5, 1963.38) \n(1981.86, 1988.04)  in a similar way when supper was ending he took the chalice and giving you thanks he said the blessing and gave the chalice to his disciples saying take\n(1988.04, 1991.92)  Take this, all of you, and drink from it,\n(1991.92, 1995.58)  for this is the chalice of my blood,\n(1995.58, 1998.1)  the blood of the new and eternal covenant,\n(1998.1, 2000.48)  which will be poured out for you and for many\n(2000.48, 2002.96)  for the forgiveness of sins.\n(2002.96, 2005.52)  Do this in memory of me.\n(2008.56, 2005.52) \n(2022.28, 2051.9)  It's the mystery of faith. Therefore, O Lord, as we celebrate the memorial of the saving passion of Your Son, His wondrous\n(2051.9, 2055.66)  resurrection and ascension into heaven, and as we look forward to his second\n(2055.66, 2060.34)  coming, we offer you in thanksgiving this holy and living sacrifice. Look, we pray,\n(2060.34, 2064.68)  upon the oblation of your church and recognizing the sacrificial victim by\n(2064.68, 2069.18)  whose death you willed to reconcile us to yourself, granted we who are nourished\n(2069.18, 2073.38)  by the body and blood of your son and filled with his Holy Spirit may become\n(2073.38, 2078.62)  one body, one spirit in Christ. May he make of us an eternal offering to you so\n(2078.62, 2081.5)  so that we may obtain an inheritance with your elect,\n(2081.5, 2083.72)  especially with the most blessed Virgin Mary,\n(2083.72, 2087.0)  Mother of God, with blessed Joseph, her spouse,\n(2087.0, 2089.54)  with your blessed apostles and glorious martyrs,\n(2089.54, 2091.02)  and with all the saints,\n(2091.02, 2093.5)  on whose constant intercession in your presence,\n(2093.5, 2095.62)  we rely for unfailing help.\n(2095.62, 2099.14)  May this sacrifice of our reconciliation, we pray, O Lord,\n(2099.14, 2102.06)  advance the peace and salvation of all the world.\n(2102.06, 2104.1)  Be pleased to confirm in faith and charity\n(2104.1, 2105.58)  your pilgrim church on earth,\n(2105.58, 2110.62)  your servant Leo, our Pope, and Richard, our Bishop, the Order of Bishops, all the\n(2110.62, 2114.98)  clergy, and the entire people you have gained for your own. Listen graciously to\n(2114.98, 2119.06)  the prayers of this family, whom you have summoned before you, and your\n(2119.06, 2123.3)  compassionable, merciful Father. Gather to yourself all your children scattered\n(2123.3, 2127.48)  throughout the world. To our departed brothers and sisters, and to all who are\n(2127.48, 2131.1)  pleasing to you at their passing from this life, give kind admittance to your\n(2131.1, 2135.02)  kingdom. There we hope to enjoy forever the fullness of your glory through\n(2135.02, 2142.7)  Christ our Lord through whom you bestow on the world all that is good through\n(2142.7, 2151.42)  him and with him and in him Oh God Almighty Father in the unity of the\n(2151.42, 2162.78)  Holy Spirit, all glory and honor is yours, forever and ever.\n(2178.06, 2181.2)  At the Savior's command and informed by\n(2181.2, 2187.44)  divine teaching we dare to say our Father who art in heaven hallowed be thy\n(2187.44, 2193.68)  name thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven give us this\n(2193.68, 2199.28)  day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who\n(2199.28, 2204.84)  trespass against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil\n(2204.84, 2210.06)  deliver us Lord we pray from every evil graciously grant peace in our days that\n(2210.06, 2211.5)  that by the help of your mercy,\n(2211.5, 2213.5)  we may be always free from sin\n(2213.5, 2215.34)  and safe from all distress,\n(2215.34, 2216.7)  as we await the blessed hope\n(2216.7, 2219.94)  and the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ.\n(2219.94, 2221.98)  For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours,\n(2221.98, 2223.72)  now and forever.\n(2223.72, 2226.26)  Lord Jesus Christ, who said to your apostles,\n(2226.26, 2228.66)  peace I leave you, my peace I give you.\n(2228.66, 2231.62)  Look not in our sins, but on the faith of your church,\n(2231.62, 2233.66)  and graciously grant her peace and unity\n(2233.66, 2235.22)  in accordance with your will,\n(2235.22, 2237.3)  who live and reign forever and ever.\n(2237.3, 2238.12)  Amen.\n(2238.12, 2239.74)  The peace of the Lord be with you always.\n(2239.74, 2244.3)  Let us offer each other the sign of peace.\n(2269.74, 2292.9)  You take away the sins of the world And all the sins of the world\n(2292.9, 2298.38)  Make holy the sins of the world.\n(2298.38, 2302.36)  Grant us peace.\n(2302.36, 2305.34)  Grant us peace.\n(2310.18, 2312.14)  Behold the Lamb of God.\n(2312.14, 2315.26)  Behold him who takes away the sins of the world.\n(2315.26, 2318.62)  Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb.\n(2318.62, 2322.54)  Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof,\n(2322.54, 2325.82)  but only say the word and my soul shall be healed.\n(2352.54, 2375.54)  I am the bread of life says the Lord, whoever comes to me will not hunger and whoever believes\n(2375.54, 2377.54)  and me will not thirst.\n(2405.54, 2412.54)  I'll see you in the next video, bye!\n(2435.54, 2449.54)  He shall feed his flow by his own food.\n(2449.54, 2461.54)  And he shall gather alums with his own food.\n(2461.54, 2483.46)  It shall, I hear it is now, I shall know it now.\n(2483.46, 2498.94)  And he shall love, and save it all, for he is love.\n(2506.42, 2498.94) \n(2523.94, 2541.22)  And carry them in his close arms, And lend him peace of arms.

Therefore, I ask the blessed Mary, ever virgin,\n(312.6, 317.96)  all the angels and saints, and you, my brothers and sisters, to pray for me to the Lord our\n(317.96, 324.64)  God. May Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us our sins, and bring us to everlasting life.\n(324.64, 335.82)  Lord have mercy, Christ have mercy, Lord have mercy, let us pray.\n(335.82, 341.3)  Almighty and merciful God, who made the priest St. John Vianney wonderful in his pastoral\n(341.3, 347.96)  zeal, grant, we pray, that through his intercession and example, we may in charity win brothers\n(347.96, 353.28)  and sisters for Christ, and attain with them eternal glory, through our Lord Jesus Christ\n(353.28, 359.28)  to her son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.\n(376.28, 378.28)  A reading from the book of Numbers.\n(378.28, 382.28)  The children of Israel lamented, would that we had meat for food,\n(382.28, 387.68)  food. We remember the fish we used to eat without cost in Egypt, and the cucumbers,\n(387.68, 393.74)  the melons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic. But now we are famished. We see nothing\n(393.74, 400.54)  before us but this manna. Manna was like coriander seed and had the color of resin. When they\n(400.54, 406.32)  had gone about and gathered it up, the people would grind it between millstones or pound\n(406.32, 411.98)  it in a mortar, then cook it in a pot and make it into loaves which tasted like cakes\n(411.98, 418.98)  made with oil. At night, when the dew fell upon the camp, the man also fell.\n(419.28, 424.54)  When Moses heard the people, family after family, crying at the entrance of their tents\n(424.54, 429.18)  so that the Lord became very angry, he was grieved.\n(429.18, 433.5)  Why do you treat your servants so badly, Moses asked the Lord?\n(433.5, 438.56)  Why are you so displeased with me that you burden me with all this people?\n(438.56, 443.48)  Was it I who conceived all this people, or was it I who gave them birth that you tell\n(443.48, 448.84)  me to carry them at my bosom, like a foster father carrying an infant to the land you\n(448.84, 451.68)  have promised under oath to their fathers?\n(451.68, 456.32)  Where can I get meat to give to all this people?\n(456.32, 460.56)  For they are crying to me, give us meat for our food.\n(460.56, 466.26)  I cannot carry all this people by myself, for they are too heavy for me.\n(466.26, 470.38)  If this is the way you will deal with me, then please do me the favour of killing me\n(470.38, 475.32)  at once, so that I need no longer face this distress.\n(475.32, 478.6)  This is the word of the Lord.\n(478.6, 486.18)  Responsorial Psalm, sing with joy to God our help.\n(486.18, 490.4)  My people heard not my voice, and Israel obeyed me not.\n(490.4, 493.4)  So I gave them up to the hardness of their hearts.\n(493.4, 499.26)  They walked according to their own counsels.\n(499.26, 504.64)  If only my people would hear me and Israel walk in my ways, quickly would I humble their\n(504.64, 505.64)  enemies.\n(505.64, 511.62)  Against their foes I would turn my hand.\n(511.62, 516.94)  Those who hated the Lord would seek to flatter me, but their fate would endure forever.\n(516.94, 521.42)  While Israel I would feed with the best of wheat, and with honey from the rock I would\n(521.42, 541.5)  God fill them.\n(541.5, 544.02)  The Lord be with you.\n(544.02, 551.26)  A reading from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew.\n(551.26, 555.3)  When Jesus heard of the death of John the Baptist, he withdrew in a boat to a deserted\n(555.3, 557.02)  place by himself.\n(557.02, 560.9)  The crowds heard of this and followed him on foot from their towns.\n(560.9, 565.58)  When he disembarked and saw the vast crowd, his heart was moved with pity for them, and\n(565.58, 567.36)  he cured their sick.\n(567.36, 570.18)  When it was evening, the disciples approached him and said,\n(570.18, 573.78)  This is a deserted place, and it is already late.\n(573.78, 578.46)  Dismiss the crowds so that they can go to the villages and buy food for themselves.\n(578.46, 583.42)  said to them there is no need for them to go away give them some food yourselves\n(583.42, 589.38)  but they said to him five loaves and two fish are all we have here then he said\n(589.38, 595.22)  bring them here to me and he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass taking\n(595.22, 598.74)  the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven he said the\n(598.74, 603.86)  blessing broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples who in turn gave them\n(603.86, 609.46)  to the crowds. They all ate and were satisfied, and they picked up the fragments left over,\n(610.1, 616.82)  12 wicker baskets full. Those who ate were about 5,000 men, not counting women and children.\n(617.38, 618.74)  The Gospel of the Lord.\n(623.94, 627.94)  Of all the beautiful and instructive art throughout the church's history,\n(627.94, 635.3)  there is one statue in this little town in France of ours that in my opinion is the most instructive,\n(635.3, 640.58)  although it is very simple. It's a picture or statue of the saint we celebrate today,\n(640.58, 646.9)  Saint John Vianney, the patron saint of priests, and he has his hand on this little boy's shoulder\n(646.9, 652.02)  and then one finger pointed up to heaven. And the story goes that when he arrived to ours,\n(652.02, 657.46)  his very first parish, it was such a backwater place. He got off the train and he didn't know\n(657.46, 661.78)  where to go and so he met this child and he asked him where is ours\n(661.78, 664.74)  and the boy showed him the way and he said\n(664.74, 669.7)  you've shown me the way to ours i will show you the way to heaven\n(669.7, 673.86)  and there's two lessons in this beautiful statue one\n(673.86, 678.5)  there is one way to heaven and that is through jesus christ in his church\n(678.5, 682.34)  jesus says i am the way the truth and the life\n(682.34, 685.86)  and no one comes to the father except through me\n(685.86, 693.22)  we need to be shown the way to heaven first and foremost that way is revealed to us by the church\n(693.22, 700.18)  by Jesus and then it is distributed to us through the church and so many people today operate under\n(700.18, 707.14)  the illusion that all roads lead to the same place and we see from what our church has revealed and\n(707.14, 713.7)  in this statue specifically that we need to be shown that way to heaven and we receive that in\n(713.7, 720.58)  docility. And the second lesson is that that responsibility primarily falls to\n(720.58, 726.46)  the priest. The priest is the one who is supposed to show the people by first and\n(726.46, 732.1)  foremost his example and his prayer and his teaching the way to heaven. John\n(732.1, 737.14)  Vianney is famous for saying leave a place without a priest for 20 years and\n(737.14, 742.9)  they will worship beasts. And this could not be more true and in fact this is\n(742.9, 747.58)  what the environment in which he came into this was post-revolution France\n(747.58, 753.38)  which completely destroyed anything sacred and beautiful in the church\n(753.38, 757.9)  desecrating holy places beheading priests and nuns in the street and this\n(757.9, 763.1)  is where John Vianney walked into but through the grace of God because turns\n(763.1, 769.26)  out we want heaven and when we're shown the way we become fully alive John\n(769.26, 773.84)  Vianney did this primarily by bringing his people back to the sacraments,\n(773.84, 779.16)  particularly confession. He said if our people are not in a state of grace we\n(779.16, 785.92)  can do nothing. We need to regain this supernatural vision and as all of us lay\n(785.92, 792.28)  people we have a responsibility to beg God for priests because people don't get\n(792.28, 799.36)  to heaven without priests and we don't want to worship beasts and so we should\n(799.36, 805.84)  encourage our friends, our sons, our grandsons, people we meet to become\n(805.84, 810.72)  priests because they're essential for God's plan of salvation. We even see this\n(810.72, 817.52)  in the readings today. Moses was a mediator. He stood between God and man to\n(817.52, 822.82)  show people the way to the Promised Land. From the first pages of the Bible we see\n(822.82, 828.72)  God was preparing the way to use priests as his instruments of salvation to point\n(828.72, 833.48)  all his beloved children to heaven. And so let us stand and ask God through the\n(833.48, 839.24)  intercession of Saint John Vianney for this grace. We pray for Pope Leo and for\n(839.24, 842.92)  Bishop Richard Henning and for all bishops throughout the church. May God\n(842.92, 847.0)  give them the grace to be true shepherds of souls after the heart of Saint John\n(847.0, 853.28)  We pray to the Lord. We pray for all civil leaders, governments, and elected\n(853.28, 857.94)  officials throughout the church. May God and may they enact policies that protect\n(857.94, 861.8)  the church and give her the freedom to be herself so the kingdom of God can be\n(861.8, 867.64)  spread to every corner of the globe. We pray to the Lord. We pray for an increase\n(867.64, 872.24)  of vocations to the priesthood into the religious life especially from members\n(872.24, 875.84)  from our own parishes and our own families. We pray to the Lord.\n(878.08, 883.6)  And we pray for our beloved dead, especially for Adeline M. Callan, for whom this Mass is offered.\n(883.6, 888.96)  Through the mercy of God and with the help of our prayers, may she come to see Christ face to face.\n(888.96, 895.84)  We pray to the Lord. Heavenly Father, we make these prayers with great confidence as we ask\n(895.84, 900.24)  them through the intercession of Saint John Vianney and Mary, our Morning Star and Gate\n(900.24, 918.56)  of heaven and we speak them in the name of Jesus her son who is Lord forever and ever.\n(988.24, 1000.16)  Pray, brothers and sisters, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God the Almighty\n(1000.16, 1002.16)  Father.\n(1002.16, 1013.6)  Receive, O Lord, we pray, the offerings placed on your altar in commemoration of Blessed\n(1013.6, 1017.94)  John Vianney so that as you brought him glory you may through these sacred\n(1017.94, 1024.0)  mysteries grant to us your pardon through Christ our Lord the Lord be with\n(1024.0, 1032.44)  you lift up your hearts let us give thanks to the Lord our God it is truly\n(1032.44, 1036.36)  right in just our duty and our salvation always and everywhere to give you\n(1036.36, 1041.4)  thanks Lord Holy Father Almighty and eternal God through Christ our Lord for\n(1041.4, 1046.64)  For as on the festival of St. John Vianney you bid your church rejoice, so too you strengthen\n(1046.64, 1051.6)  her by the example of His holy life, teach her by His words of preaching, and keep her\n(1051.6, 1054.1)  safe in answer to His prayers.\n(1054.1, 1058.72)  And so with the company of angels and saints, we sing the hymn of your praise, as without\n(1058.72, 1060.24)  end we acclaim.\n(1060.24, 1068.08)  Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts, heaven and earth are full of your glory, O Zana in\n(1068.08, 1069.08)  the highest.\n(1069.08, 1072.08)  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord,\n(1072.08, 1076.08)  Hosanna in the highest.\n(1076.08, 1078.08)  You are indeed holy, O Lord,\n(1078.08, 1080.08)  and all you have created rightly gives you praise.\n(1080.08, 1083.08)  For through your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ,\n(1083.08, 1085.08)  by the power and working of the Holy Spirit,\n(1085.08, 1088.08)  you give life to all things and make them holy.\n(1088.08, 1091.08)  And you never cease to gather a people to yourself,\n(1091.08, 1094.08)  so that from the rising of the sun to its setting,\n(1094.08, 1097.08)  a pure sacrifice may be offered to your name.\n(1097.08, 1102.72)  Therefore, O Lord, we humbly implore you, by the same Spirit graciously make holy\n(1102.72, 1106.72)  these gifts we have brought to you for consecration, that they may become the\n(1106.72, 1112.28)  body and blood of your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, at whose command we\n(1112.28, 1117.92)  celebrate these mysteries. For on the night he was betrayed, he himself took\n(1117.92, 1123.16)  bread, and giving you thanks, he said the blessing, broke the bread, and gave it to\n(1123.16, 1132.84)  his disciples saying take this all of you and eat of it for this is my body\n(1132.84, 1152.88)  which will be given up for you in a similar way when supper was ended\n(1152.88, 1157.92)  he took the chalice and giving you thanks he said the blessing and gave the\n(1157.92, 1166.0)  chalice to his disciples saying take this all of you and drink from it for\n(1166.0, 1171.64)  this is the chalice of my blood the blood of the new and eternal covenant\n(1171.64, 1177.68)  which will be poured out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins do this\n(1177.68, 1200.16)  in memory of me the mystery of faith save us savior of the world for by your\n(1200.16, 1205.56)  cross and resurrection you have set us free therefore o Lord as we celebrate\n(1205.56, 1209.6)  the memorial of the saving passion of your son, his wondrous resurrection and\n(1209.6, 1213.54)  ascension into heaven, and as we look forward to his second coming, we offer\n(1213.54, 1217.86)  you in thanksgiving this holy and living sacrifice. Look, we pray, upon the\n(1217.86, 1222.1)  oblation of your church and recognizing the sacrificial victim by whose death\n(1222.1, 1226.36)  you willed to reconcile us to yourself. Grant that we who are nourished by the\n(1226.36, 1230.3)  body and blood of your son and filled with this Holy Spirit may become one\n(1230.3, 1235.38)  body, one spirit in Christ. May he make of us an eternal offering to you so that we\n(1235.38, 1239.94)  We may obtain an inheritance with Your elect, especially with the Most Blessed Virgin Mary,\n(1239.94, 1245.52)  Mother of God, with Blessed Joseph, her spouse, with Your Blessed Apostles and Glorious Martyrs,\n(1245.52, 1250.68)  with St. John Vianney, and with all the Saints, on whose constant intercession in Your presence\n(1250.68, 1253.36)  we rely for unfailing help.\n(1253.36, 1258.6)  May this sacrifice of our reconciliation, we pray, O Lord, advance the peace and salvation\n(1258.6, 1259.9)  of all the world.\n(1259.9, 1264.12)  Be pleased to confirm in faith and charity Your pilgrim Church on earth, with Your servant\n(1264.12, 1269.32)  Leo, our Pope, and Richard, our Bishop, the Order of Bishops, all the clergy, and the\n(1269.32, 1274.02)  entire people you have gained for your own. Listen graciously to the prayers of\n(1274.02, 1278.02)  this family, whom you have summoned before you. In your compassion, O\n(1278.02, 1282.02)  merciful Father, gather to yourself all your children scattered throughout the\n(1282.02, 1286.44)  world. To our departed brothers and sisters, and to all who are pleasing to\n(1286.44, 1290.66)  you at their passing from this life, give kind admittance to your kingdom. There we\n(1290.66, 1294.16)  hope to enjoy forever the fullness of your glory, through Christ our Lord,\n(1294.16, 1302.96)  through whom you bestow on the world all that is good. Through him and with him\n(1302.96, 1308.66)  and in him, O God Almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, all glory and\n(1308.66, 1316.64)  honor is yours forever and ever. At the Savior's command and formed by divine\n(1316.64, 1323.6)  teaching we dare to say our Father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy\n(1323.6, 1329.52)  kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven give us this day our\n(1329.52, 1334.76)  daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who\n(1334.76, 1340.56)  trespass against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil\n(1340.56, 1346.32)  deliver us Lord we pray from every evil graciously grant peace in our days that\n(1346.32, 1349.88)  that by the help of your mercy we may be always free from sin\n(1349.88, 1354.48)  and safe from all distress as we await the blessed hope in the coming of our Savior,\n(1354.48, 1360.08)  Jesus Christ.\n(1360.08, 1362.6)  Lord Jesus Christ, who said to your apostles,\n(1362.6, 1367.56)  peace I leave you, my peace I give you. Look not on our sins, but on the faith of your church,\n(1367.56, 1370.92)  and graciously grant her peace and unity in accordance with your will,\n(1370.92, 1375.76)  who live and reign forever and ever. The peace of the Lord be with you always.\n(1375.76, 1382.56)  Let us offer each other the sign of peace.\n(1382.56, 1388.06)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1388.06, 1393.16)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1393.16, 1397.46)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, grant us peace.\n(1405.76, 1418.76)  Behold the Lamb of God, behold him who takes away the sins of the world.\n(1418.76, 1421.3)  Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb.\n(1421.3, 1427.06)  Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof, but only say the word and my\n(1427.06, 1434.06)  soul shall be healed.\n(1457.06, 1480.5)  Blessed is the servant whom the Lord finds watching when he comes, amen I say to you,\n(1480.5, 1487.5)  He will put that servant in charge of all his property.\n(1630.5, 1637.5)  So, thank you very much for your attention and I look forward to seeing you again soon.\n(1720.5, 1725.5)  Let us pray.\n(1725.5, 1732.5)  May partaking at the heavenly table, Almighty God, confirm and increase strength from on high,\n(1732.5, 1736.5)  and all who celebrate the feast day of Blessed John Vianney,\n(1736.5, 1739.5)  that we may preserve into egrity the gift of faith,\n(1739.5, 1745.5)  and walk in the path of salvation you trace for us, through Christ our Lord.\n(1745.5, 1747.5)  The Lord be with you.\n(1747.5, 1752.5)  May almighty God bless you, the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit.\n(1752.5, 1755.5)  Go forth, the Mass has ended.\n(1755.5, 1760.5)  Saint Michael, the Archangel, defend us in battle.\n(1760.5, 1764.5)  Be our protection against the wickedness and snares of the devil.\n(1764.5, 1767.5)  May God rebuke him, we humbly pray.\n(1767.5, 1771.5)  And do thou, the prince of the heavenly hosts, by the power of God,\n(1771.5, 1775.5)  cast into hell Satan and all the evil spirits\n(1775.5, 1781.58)  who prowl about the world, seeking the ruin of souls.

My brothers and sisters let us\n(277.8, 281.18)  acknowledge our sins and so prepare ourselves to celebrate the sacred\n(281.18, 289.24)  mysteries. I confess to Almighty God and to you my brothers and sisters that I\n(289.24, 294.52)  have bravely sinned in my thoughts and in my words and what I have done and what I\n(294.52, 298.2)  I have failed to do, through my fault, through my fault,\n(298.2, 300.28)  through my most grievous fault.\n(300.28, 303.1)  Therefore, I ask the blessed Mary of her virgin,\n(303.1, 307.12)  all the angels and saints, and you, my brothers and sisters,\n(307.12, 309.7)  to pray for me to the Lord our God.\n(309.7, 311.6)  May almighty God have mercy on us.\n(311.6, 315.18)  Forgive us our sins and bring us to everlasting life.\n(315.18, 316.4)  Lord, have mercy.\n(317.56, 318.86)  Christ, have mercy.\n(319.98, 321.3)  Lord, have mercy.\n(323.0, 321.3) \n(329.82, 335.22)  Let us pray. Almighty and merciful God, who made the priest, St. John Vianney, wonderful in his pastoral zeal, grant, we pray, that through his intercession and\n(335.22, 340.26)  example we may in charity win brothers and sisters for Christ and attain with\n(340.26, 345.02)  them eternal glory. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your son, who lives and reigns\n(345.02, 350.58)  with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God forever and ever.\n(351.3, 363.22)  A reading from the book of Numbers.\n(363.22, 369.22)  The children of Israel lamented, would that we had meat for food.\n(369.22, 375.64)  We remember the fish we used to eat without cost in Egypt, and the cucumbers, the melons,\n(375.64, 379.24)  the leeks, the youngins, and the garlic.\n(379.24, 381.52)  But now we are famished.\n(381.52, 385.64)  We see nothing before us but this manna.\n(385.64, 390.92)  Manna was like coriander seed and had the color of resin.\n(390.92, 396.8)  When they had gone about and gathered it up, the people would grind it between millstones\n(396.8, 403.12)  or pound it in a mortar, then cook it in a pot and make it into loaves, which tasted\n(403.12, 405.68)  like cakes made with oil.\n(405.68, 412.84)  At night, when the dew fell upon the camp, the manna also fell.\n(412.84, 419.92)  When Moses heard the people, family after family, crying at the entrance of their tents,\n(419.92, 424.62)  so that the Lord became very angry, he was grieved.\n(424.62, 429.18)  Why do you treat your servants so badly, Moses asked the Lord?\n(429.18, 435.36)  Why are you so displeased with me that you burden me with all this people?\n(435.36, 441.66)  Was it I who conceived all this people, or was it I who gave them birth, that you tell\n(441.66, 448.1)  me to carry them at my bosom, like a foster father carrying an infant, to the land you\n(448.1, 452.74)  have promised, under oath to their fathers?\n(452.74, 455.94)  Where can I get me to give all this people?\n(455.94, 458.06)  For they are crying to me.\n(458.06, 460.72)  Give us meat for our food.\n(460.72, 464.22)  I cannot carry all this people by myself.\n(464.22, 467.06)  for they are too heavy for me.\n(467.06, 469.88)  If this is the way you will deal with me,\n(469.88, 473.94)  then please do me a favor of killing me at once,\n(473.94, 478.1)  so that I need no longer face this distress.\n(478.1, 479.28)  The word of the Lord.\n(481.8, 484.0)  The response, the real psalm,\n(484.0, 486.92)  sing with joy to God our help.\n(491.16, 493.84)  My people heard not my voice,\n(493.84, 497.96)  and Israel obeyed me not, so I gave them up\n(497.96, 500.48)  to the hardness of their hearts.\n(500.48, 504.28)  They walked according to their own counsels.\n(504.28, 507.36)  Sing with joy to God our help.\n(507.36, 512.8)  If only people would hear me and Israel walk in my ways,\n(512.8, 517.16)  quickly would I humble their enemies against their foes,\n(517.16, 519.2)  I would turn my hand.\n(519.2, 522.52)  Sing with joy to God our help.\n(522.52, 526.4)  Those who hated the Lord would seek to flatter me,\n(526.4, 529.28)  but their fate would endure forever.\n(529.28, 532.88)  While Israel I would feed with the best of wheat,\n(532.88, 536.6)  and with honey from the rock I would fill them.\n(536.6, 538.68)  Sing with joy to God our help.\n(552.52, 565.22)  The Lord be with you, a reading from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew.\n(565.22, 569.62)  When Jesus heard of the death of John the Baptist, he withdrew in a boat to a deserted\n(569.62, 571.34)  place by himself.\n(571.34, 575.08)  The crowds heard of this and followed him on foot from their towns.\n(575.08, 579.78)  When he disembarked and saw the vast crowd, his heart was moved with pity for them, and\n(579.78, 581.46)  he cured their sick.\n(581.46, 584.7)  When it was evening, the disciples approached him and said,\n(584.7, 587.9)  this is a deserted place, and it is already late.\n(587.9, 590.9)  Dismiss the crowds so that they can go to the villages\n(590.9, 593.04)  and buy food for themselves.\n(593.04, 596.62)  He said to them, there is no need for them to go away.\n(596.62, 598.74)  Give them some food yourselves.\n(598.74, 601.86)  But they said to him, five loaves and two fish\n(601.86, 603.74)  are all we have here.\n(603.74, 606.3)  Then he said, bring them here to me.\n(606.3, 609.38)  And he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass,\n(609.38, 611.46)  taking the five loaves and the two fish\n(611.46, 613.08)  and looking up to heaven.\n(613.08, 615.74)  He said the blessing, broke the loaves\n(615.74, 617.74)  and gave them to the disciples,\n(617.74, 620.14)  who in turn gave them to the crowds.\n(620.14, 622.7)  They all ate and were satisfied.\n(622.7, 625.1)  And they picked up the fragments left over,\n(625.1, 627.36)  12 wicker baskets full.\n(627.36, 630.1)  Those who ate were about 5,000 men,\n(630.1, 631.92)  not counting women and children.\n(632.82, 634.18)  The gospel of the Lord.\n(638.7, 634.18) \n(646.46, 651.94)  Of all of the beautiful art and statues throughout the church, there is one statue in ours, France, the home of Saint John Vianney, the saint we celebrate today, that I think, though far\n(651.94, 657.56)  less grand than some of the things in Rome, is equally as instructive.\n(657.56, 662.56)  It's a statue of John Vianney, and he has his hand on the shoulder of a little boy,\n(662.56, 666.5)  With the other hand, he has a finger pointing up to heaven.\n(666.5, 672.02)  And the story goes that when John Vianney arrived in Arles, France, it was such a backwater\n(672.02, 674.7)  place he didn't know where his parish was.\n(674.7, 679.18)  And so he met this boy and he asked him where is Arles, and the boy showed him.\n(679.18, 684.62)  And then he said, you have shown me the way to Arles, I will show you the way to heaven.\n(684.62, 687.94)  And so there's two lessons from this simple statue.\n(687.94, 692.94)  The first is we need to be shown the path to heaven.\n(693.62, 696.74)  There is one road to walk to heaven,\n(696.74, 699.94)  and that is revealed to us by Jesus\n(699.94, 702.78)  and then distributed through the church.\n(702.78, 706.56)  And many people operate under the illusion\n(706.56, 710.94)  that they can discover that on their own.\n(710.94, 714.34)  Jesus is the one who shows us the way.\n(714.34, 717.74)  Jesus himself is the way, the truth, and the life,\n(717.74, 720.84)  and that path needs to be shown to us.\n(720.84, 724.24)  The second lesson, though all of us play a role\n(724.24, 726.7)  in showing others that path,\n(726.7, 730.56)  that responsibility falls primarily to the priest.\n(730.56, 735.08)  God gave us the priesthood for the salvation of souls.\n(735.08, 738.4)  John Vianney is famous for saying that without priests,\n(738.4, 742.68)  he said this, if you leave a parish without a priest\n(742.68, 747.0)  for 20 years, the people in that entire neighborhood\n(747.0, 749.76)  or area will worship beasts.\n(749.76, 751.28)  And this is very true.\n(752.32, 754.44)  The priesthood is the one.\n(754.44, 756.96)  The priests are the one who are supposed to show us\n(756.96, 760.04)  through their example primarily and then their prayers\n(760.04, 763.24)  and their teachings the way to heaven.\n(763.24, 765.64)  John Vianney, when he arrived in ours,\n(765.64, 767.24)  the place was godless.\n(767.24, 770.74)  In fact, all of France was post the revolution.\n(770.74, 775.68)  And through this man's holy example and his fervent prayers,\n(775.68, 778.28)  People from all over the country were coming\n(778.28, 781.84)  to hear him preach and to have their sins absolved.\n(782.82, 785.36)  We need to return to this supernatural vision\n(785.36, 788.92)  to understand that if we want everyone to get to heaven,\n(788.92, 791.92)  we need a revival in the priesthood.\n(791.92, 795.2)  Every single person has a role to play in this.\n(795.2, 796.76)  We should pray for priests.\n(796.76, 799.08)  We should beg God for holy priests.\n(799.08, 801.6)  We should encourage our friends, our children,\n(801.6, 804.08)  our grandchildren to become priests\n(804.08, 808.7)  because without priests, we don't know the way to heaven.\n(808.7, 810.38)  It really is that simple.\n(810.38, 812.82)  And so today we ask God for the grace\n(812.82, 815.58)  to protect all of his priests and to inspire many more\n(815.58, 817.86)  through the intercession of Saint John Vianney.\n(817.86, 819.62)  And so let us make our petitions known\n(819.62, 820.96)  to our Heavenly Father.\n(823.22, 826.28)  We pray for Pope Leo and for Bishop Richard Henning\n(826.28, 828.34)  and for all bishops throughout the church.\n(828.34, 831.86)  May God give them the grace to be true shepherds of souls\n(831.86, 834.54)  who point us to the way to our heavenly homeland.\n(834.54, 835.82)  We pray to the Lord.\n(837.48, 839.82)  We pray for all civil leaders, governments,\n(839.82, 841.78)  and elected officials throughout the world.\n(841.78, 844.48)  May they enact policies that protect the church\n(844.48, 846.74)  and give her the freedom to be herself\n(846.74, 848.32)  so the kingdom of God can be spread\n(848.32, 849.54)  to every corner of the globe.\n(849.54, 850.72)  We pray to the Lord.\n(852.22, 854.38)  We pray for an increase of vocations\n(854.38, 856.76)  to the priesthood and to the religious life,\n(856.76, 859.02)  especially for members from our own parishes\n(859.02, 860.42)  and our own families.\n(860.42, 861.62)  we pray to the Lord.\n(863.22, 864.9)  And we pray for our parishioners\n(864.9, 866.42)  for whom this mass is offered.\n(866.42, 867.66)  We pray to the Lord.\n(869.04, 872.3)  Heavenly Father, we make these prayers with great confidence\n(872.3, 875.42)  as we ask them through the intercession of St. John Vianney\n(875.42, 877.98)  and Mary, our morning star in gate of heaven.\n(877.98, 880.42)  And we speak them in the name of Jesus, her son,\n(880.42, 882.34)  who is Lord forever and ever.\n(882.34, 883.16)  Amen.\n(920.42, 925.42)  .\n(925.42, 930.42)  .\n(930.42, 935.42)  .\n(935.42, 940.42)  .\n(940.42, 945.42)  .\n(945.42, 975.4)  Hey brothers and sisters, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God, the almighty\n(975.4, 989.06)  Father receive a Lord we pray the offerings placed in your altar in\n(989.06, 993.88)  commemoration of blessed John beyond so that as you brought him glory you may\n(993.88, 1000.32)  through these sacred mysteries grant to us your part through Christ our Lord the\n(1000.32, 1009.04)  Lord be with you. Lift up your hearts. Let us give thanks to the Lord our God. It is\n(1009.04, 1013.4)  truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, always and everywhere to give\n(1013.4, 1018.4)  you thanks. Lord Holy Father, Almighty and eternal God, through Christ our Lord. For\n(1018.4, 1023.1)  as on the festival of St. John Vianney you bid your church rejoice, so too you\n(1023.1, 1027.28)  strengthen her by the example of his holy life, teach her by his words of\n(1027.28, 1031.8)  preaching and keep her safe and answer to his prayers and so with the company\n(1031.8, 1036.44)  of angels and saints we sing to him of your praise as without end we acclaim\n(1036.44, 1043.42)  holy holy holy Lord God of hosts heaven and earth are full of your glory\n(1043.42, 1049.56)  ozonna in the highest blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord ozonna in\n(1049.56, 1056.66)  the highest you are indeed holy Oh Lord and all you have created rightly gives\n(1056.66, 1062.58)  you praise for through your son our lord jesus christ by the power and working of the holy spirit\n(1062.58, 1068.1)  you give life to all things and make them holy and you never cease to gather a people to yourself\n(1068.1, 1073.46)  so that from the rising of the sun to its setting a pure sacrifice may be offered to your name\n(1074.34, 1080.02)  therefore oh lord we humbly implore you by the same spirit graciously make holy these gifts we\n(1080.02, 1086.42)  have brought to you for consecration that they may become the body and blood of your son our lord\n(1086.42, 1090.98)  Jesus Christ at whose command we celebrate these mysteries for on the\n(1090.98, 1096.7)  night he was betrayed he himself took bread and giving you thanks he said the\n(1096.7, 1104.74)  blessing broke the bread and gave it to his disciples say take this all of you\n(1104.74, 1114.46)  and eat of it for this is my body which will be given up for you\n(1116.42, 1132.54)  In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took the chalice, and giving you thanks he\n(1132.54, 1140.86)  said the blessing, and gave the chalice to his disciples, saying, Take this, all of you,\n(1140.86, 1145.86)  and drink from it, for this is the chalice of my blood,\n(1145.98, 1148.58)  the blood of the new and eternal covenant,\n(1148.58, 1151.0)  which will be poured out for you and for many\n(1151.0, 1152.58)  for the forgiveness of sins.\n(1153.52, 1156.24)  Do this in memory of me.\n(1159.54, 1156.24) \n(1178.04, 1183.46)  The mystery of faith. Save us, Savior of the world, for by your cross and resurrection you have set us free. Therefore, O Lord, as we celebrate the memorial of the saving passion\n(1183.46, 1188.26)  of your son, his wondrous resurrection and ascension into heaven, and as we look forward\n(1188.26, 1193.36)  to his second coming, we offer you in thanksgiving this holy and living sacrifice.\n(1193.36, 1198.38)  Look we pray upon the oblation of your church, in recognizing the sacrificial victim by whose\n(1198.38, 1203.72)  death you willed to reconcile us to yourself, granted we who are nourished by the body and\n(1203.72, 1208.32)  blood of your son, and filled with his Holy Spirit, may become one body, one spirit in\n(1208.32, 1213.06)  Christ. May he make of us an eternal offering to you, so that we may obtain an\n(1213.06, 1217.1)  inheritance with your elect, especially with the most blessed Virgin Mary, Mother\n(1217.1, 1221.76)  of God, with blessed Joseph, her spouse, with your blessed apostles and glorious\n(1221.76, 1226.5)  martyrs, with Saint John Biani, and with all the Saints. Under his constant\n(1226.5, 1232.34)  intersection in your presence, we rely for unfailing help. May this sacrifice of\n(1232.34, 1236.7)  our reconciliation, we pray over, advance the peace and salvation of all the\n(1236.7, 1241.3)  world. Be pleased to confirm in faith and charity your pilgrim church on earth with\n(1241.3, 1246.34)  your servant Leo our Pope and Richard our Bishop, the order of bishops, all the\n(1246.34, 1250.42)  clergy and the entire people you have gained for your own. Listen graciously\n(1250.42, 1255.06)  to the prayers of this family whom you have summoned before you. In your\n(1255.06, 1259.34)  compassion and merciful father gather to yourself all your children scattered\n(1259.34, 1263.7)  throughout the world. To our departed brothers and sisters and to all who are\n(1263.7, 1267.38)  pleasing to you at their passing from this life. Give kind admissions to your\n(1267.38, 1271.34)  kingdom, there we hope to enjoy forever the fullness of your glory through\n(1271.34, 1279.12)  Christ our Lord, through whom you bestow on the world all that is good. Through\n(1279.12, 1284.7)  him and with him and in him, O God Almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy\n(1284.7, 1292.5)  Spirit, all glory and honor is yours forever and ever. At the Savior's command\n(1292.5, 1299.74)  informed by divine teaching we dare to say our Father who art in heaven hallowed\n(1299.74, 1306.18)  be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven give us\n(1306.18, 1312.26)  this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who\n(1312.26, 1317.9)  trespass against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil\n(1317.9, 1323.18)  Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil. Graciously grant peace in our days, that\n(1323.18, 1327.22)  by the help of your mercy we may be always free from sin and safe from all\n(1327.22, 1331.6)  distress, as we await the blessed hope and the coming of our Savior, Jesus\n(1331.6, 1340.88)  Christ. Lord Jesus Christ, who said to your apostles, peace I leave you, my peace\n(1340.88, 1345.32)  I give you. Look not in our sins but on the faith of your church, and graciously\n(1345.32, 1349.88)  grant her peace and unity in accordance with your will, who live and reign forever and ever.\n(1350.68, 1355.72)  The peace of the Lord be with you always. Let us offer each other the sign of peace.\n(1359.24, 1363.0)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world,\n(1363.0, 1369.4)  have mercy on us. Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1370.12, 1374.52)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, grant us peace.\n(1375.32, 1395.52)  Behold the Lamb of God. Behold Him who takes away the sins of the world. Blessed are those\n(1395.52, 1400.64)  called to the supper of the Lamb. Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under\n(1400.64, 1404.64)  my roof, but only say the word and my soul shall be healed.\n(1430.64, 1444.72)  Blessed is the servant whom the Lord finds watching.\n(1444.72, 1455.96)  When he comes, amen I say to you, he will put that servant in charge of all his property.\n(1635.96, 1658.12)  Let us pray.\n(1658.12, 1663.4)  May partaking at the heavenly table almighty God confirm and increase strength from on\n(1663.4, 1668.32)  high and all who celebrate the feast day of blessed John the Un, that we may\n(1668.32, 1673.66)  preserve an integrity to give to faith and walk in the path of salvation you\n(1673.66, 1681.22)  trace for us through Christ our Lord. The Lord be with you. May almighty God bless\n(1681.22, 1689.98)  you, the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Go forth, the mass is ended.\n(1689.98, 1693.58)  Michael, the Archangel, defend us in battle.\n",

        "transcript": "(60.0, 88.0)  So, thank you very much for joining us today, and we'll see you in the next session.\n(235.0, 254.46)  In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, the grace of our Lord\n(254.46, 260.02)  Jesus Christ, the love that is God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with you all.\n(260.02, 261.02)  Amen.\n(261.02, 265.9)  Good morning. Let's take a moment and reflect on God's mercy and our own need for it\n(273.58, 275.58)  Lord have mercy\n(276.14, 278.14)  Christ have mercy\n(278.54, 280.54)  Lord have mercy\n(280.7, 287.82)  And may Almighty God have mercy on us all forgive us our sins and bring each of us to everlasting life\n(288.42, 290.42)  Let us pray\n(291.02, 299.82)  Almighty, ever-living God, whom taught by the Holy Spirit, we dare to call our Father.\n(299.82, 305.54)  Bring, we pray, to perfection in our hearts the spirit of adoption, as your sons and daughters,\n(305.54, 310.46)  that we may merit to enter into the inheritance which you have promised, through our Lord\n(310.46, 315.34)  Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\n(315.34, 319.34)  forever and ever. Amen.\n(345.34, 352.08)  A Reading from the Book of Deuteronomy.\n(352.08, 357.92)  Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Vebo, the headland of Pisgah, which faces\n(357.92, 365.92)  Jericho, and the Lord showed him all the land, Gilead and as far as Dan, all Naphtali, the\n(365.92, 372.56)  land of Ephraim and Messana, the land of Judah as far as the western sea, the Negeb, the\n(372.56, 377.84)  circuit of the Jordan with the lowlands at Jericho, city of palms, and as far as\n(377.84, 385.1)  Zohar. The Lord then said to him, this is the land which I swore to Abraham, Isaac,\n(385.1, 389.64)  and Jacob that I would give to their descendants. I have let you feast your\n(389.64, 395.92)  eyes upon it, but you shall not cross over. So there in the land of Moab, Moses\n(395.92, 401.48)  the servant of the Lord, died as the Lord had said, and he was buried in the ravine\n(401.48, 407.6)  opposite Beth Peor in the land of Moab, but to this day no one knows the place\n(407.6, 414.68)  of his burial. Moses was 120 years old when he died, yet his eyes were undimmed\n(414.68, 421.04)  and his vigor unabated. For 30 days the children of Israel wept for Moses in the\n(421.04, 425.8)  plains of Moab till they had completed the period of grief and mourning for\n(425.8, 431.36)  Moses. Now Joshua son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom since Moses\n(431.36, 435.92)  had laid his hands upon him, so the children of Israel gave him their\n(435.92, 442.52)  obedience, thus carrying out the Lord's command to Moses. Since then no prophet\n(442.52, 448.96)  has arisen in Israel like Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face. He had no equal\n(448.96, 453.32)  in all the signs and wonders the Lord sent him to perform in the land of Egypt\n(453.32, 458.84)  against Pharaoh and all his servants and against all his land. For the might and\n(458.84, 464.6)  the terrifying power that Moses exhibited in the sight of all Israel.\n(464.6, 467.88)  This is the word of the Lord.\n(467.88, 477.32)  Responsorial Psalm, Blessed be God, who filled my soul with fire.\n(477.32, 479.88)  Shout joyfully to God, all the earth.\n(479.88, 482.88)  Sing praise to the glory of his name.\n(482.88, 485.84)  Proclaim his glorious praise.\n(485.84, 493.12)  Say to God, how tremendous are your deeds.\n(493.12, 498.66)  Come and see the works of God, his tremendous deeds among the children of Adam.\n(498.66, 506.64)  Bless our God, you peoples, loudly, sound his praise.\n(506.64, 513.28)  Hear now, all you who fear God, while I declare what he has done for me.\n(513.28, 520.28)  When I appealed to him in words, praise was on the tip of my tongue.\n(543.28, 554.84)  the Lord be with you a reading from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew if your\n(554.84, 559.12)  brother Jesus said to his disciples if your brother sins against you go and\n(559.12, 567.0)  tell him his fault between you and him alone if he listens to you you have won\n(567.0, 573.24)  over your brother if he does not listen take one or two others along with you\n(573.24, 580.84)  you, so that every fact may be established on the testimony of two or three witnesses.\n(580.84, 585.72)  If he refuses to listen to them, tell the church.\n(585.72, 591.52)  If he refuses to listen to the church, then treat him as you would a Gentile or a tax\n(591.52, 592.52)  collector.\n(592.52, 598.46)  Amen, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you\n(598.46, 601.82)  loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\n(601.82, 607.32)  And then, amen, I say to you,\n(607.32, 609.32)  if two of you agree on Earth about anything for which they are to pray,\n(609.32, 612.32)  it shall be granted to them by my Heavenly Father.\n(612.32, 616.32)  For where two or three are gathered together in my name,\n(616.32, 619.32)  there am I in the midst of them.\n(619.32, 621.32)  The Gospel of the Lord.\n(621.32, 626.32)  Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ.\n(626.32, 629.32)  Today's piece from the Gospel,\n(629.32, 636.88)  one of the one of the pieces of the piece is where we get in our churches like moral and ethical teaching we talk about the\n(636.98, 638.48)  principle of\n(638.48, 640.0)  subsidiarity\n(640.0, 642.32)  This is where it comes from and what that means is\n(643.36, 648.48)  We need to be able to deal with each other in our issues kind of on the most local level\n(648.6, 650.92)  possible before you kick it to the next one and\n(651.56, 654.56)  I think that's particularly relevant now\n(655.68, 658.08)  Even though it was 2,000 years ago clearly\n(659.08, 658.08) \n(662.36, 664.22)  because we're moving more and more into a time where people don't talk to each other.\n(665.66, 668.08)  They don't engage with people\n(668.08, 670.92)  who think differently, act differently.\n(672.0, 674.86)  And if they do, it might only be digitally\n(674.86, 676.32)  or distant at best.\n(676.32, 678.28)  And so I think those of us that are here,\n(678.28, 680.52)  we know that the importance of gathering\n(680.52, 684.14)  into the body of Christ visible in the world.\n(684.14, 687.4)  So let us go to the altar of God today,\n(687.4, 689.48)  asking for that special grace and courage\n(689.48, 692.88)  to be fed especially to be able to be that witness\n(692.88, 696.98)  to this community building way of doing justice,\n(696.98, 698.94)  right relationships in the world.\n(717.4, 730.32)  Having heard and reflected on God's Word, we take a moment to make our prayers known\n(730.32, 733.04)  to one another and to the Father.\n(733.04, 737.36)  We pray for our church all throughout the world in all the ways that it gathers.\n(737.36, 743.08)  We pray especially for those who do not enjoy the freedom and safety together that we do.\n(743.08, 747.0)  For all those women and men who lead us in the church and especially for Pope Leo, we\n(747.0, 748.22)  we pray to the Lord.\n(750.14, 752.98)  We pray for our country that we might grow\n(752.98, 755.64)  in the ways of gospel, peace, justice, and love,\n(755.64, 756.86)  we pray to the Lord.\n(758.42, 760.3)  We pray for our local community here,\n(760.3, 762.94)  Boston, our archdiocese, our parish,\n(762.94, 765.68)  those we know and love, we pray to the Lord.\n(767.14, 769.14)  And we never forget our dead,\n(769.14, 771.16)  those we have known and loved,\n(771.16, 773.94)  those that seemingly have no one left to pray for them,\n(773.94, 775.66)  those we remember in this mass,\n(775.66, 778.7)  that all the dead might know the loving embrace of God,\n(778.7, 779.92)  we pray to the Lord.\n(781.62, 782.64)  Gracious and loving God,\n(782.64, 784.62)  we bring all our prayers before you this day,\n(784.62, 786.9)  confident that you do hear them,\n(786.9, 789.54)  for we do make them in Jesus' name, amen.\n(805.66, 828.72)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for it is through your goodness that we have\n(828.72, 831.78)  received this bread which we now offer to you.\n(831.78, 836.02)  It is the fruit of the earth and the work of human hands, and it will become for us\n(836.02, 837.02)  the bread of life.\n(837.02, 838.02)  Blessed is God forever.\n(838.02, 853.34)  By the mingling of this watering wine may we come to share in the divinity of Christ,\n(853.34, 857.84)  who humbled himself to share in our humanity.\n(857.84, 861.06)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for it is through your goodness that we have\n(861.06, 866.02)  receive this wine which we now offer to you. It is the fruit of the vine and the\n(866.02, 871.66)  work of human hands and will become for us our spiritual drink.\n(871.66, 875.8)  With humble spirit and contrite hearts may we be accepted by you, O Lord, and may our\n(875.8, 881.06)  sacrifice be pleasing in your sight this day. Lord, wash away my iniquities, cleanse\n(881.06, 888.46)  me of my sins. Pray, my sisters and brothers, that this our sacrifice might\n(888.46, 900.4)  be acceptable to God the Almighty Father be pleased oh Lord to accept the\n(900.4, 905.28)  offerings of your church for in your mercy you have given them to be offered\n(905.28, 909.52)  and by your power you transform them into the mystery of our salvation\n(909.52, 917.5)  through Christ our Lord the Lord be with you lift up your hearts let us give\n(917.5, 922.66)  thanks to the Lord our God. It is truly right and just our duty and our\n(922.66, 926.62)  salvation always and everywhere to give you thanks Father of mercies and\n(926.62, 933.42)  faithful God. For you have given us Jesus Christ your Son as our Lord and Redeemer.\n(933.42, 941.02)  He always showed compassion for children and for the poor, for sick and for sinners,\n(941.02, 947.22)  and he became a neighbor to the oppressed and the afflicted. By word and\n(947.22, 951.98)  deed he announced to the world that you are our father and that you care for all\n(951.98, 957.42)  of your sons and daughters and so with all the angels and saints we exalt and\n(957.42, 961.58)  bless your name and sing the hymn of your glory as without end we acclaim\n(961.58, 964.58)  holy\n(971.02, 974.02)  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord,\n(974.02, 976.02)  the Son and the Christ.\n(980.02, 982.02)  You are indeed holy and to be glorified,\n(982.02, 984.02)  O God who loved the human race,\n(984.02, 988.02)  and who always walk with us on our journey of life.\n(988.02, 990.02)  Blessed indeed is your Son,\n(990.02, 992.02)  present in our midst,\n(992.02, 994.02)  when we are gathered by His love.\n(994.02, 997.02)  And when as once for His disciples,\n(997.02, 998.02)  so now for us,\n(998.02, 1004.44)  he opens the scriptures and breaks the bread therefore father most merciful we\n(1004.44, 1010.88)  ask send forth your Holy Spirit to sanctify these gifts of bread and wine\n(1010.88, 1021.08)  that they may become the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ on the day\n(1021.08, 1027.72)  before he was to suffer on the night of the Last Supper Jesus himself took bread\n(1027.72, 1033.94)  into his hands and said the blessing he broke the bread gave it to his disciples\n(1033.94, 1040.56)  saying take this all of you and eat of it for this is my body which will be\n(1040.56, 1043.68)  given up for you\n(1052.24, 1043.68) \n(1058.74, 1066.52)  In a similar way, when the supper was ended, he took the chalice, gave you thanks and gave the chalice to his disciples, saying take this all of you and drink from it, for this\n(1066.52, 1073.44)  is the chalice of my blood, the blood of the new and eternal covenant, which will be poured\n(1073.44, 1078.72)  out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Do this in memory of\n(1078.72, 1100.64)  me. The mystery of faith when we eat this bread. Therefore, Holy Father, as we\n(1100.64, 1106.38)  We celebrate the memorial of Christ your Son, our Savior, whom you led through his passion\n(1106.38, 1111.08)  and death on the cross to the glory of the resurrection, and whom you have seated at\n(1111.08, 1113.22)  your right hand.\n(1113.22, 1118.26)  We proclaim the work of your love until he comes again, and we offer you the bread of\n(1118.26, 1121.98)  life and the chalice of blessing.\n(1121.98, 1126.98)  Look with favor on the oblation of your church, in which we show forth the paschal sacrifice\n(1126.98, 1134.12)  of Christ that has been handed on to us, and grant that, by the power of the Spirit of\n(1134.12, 1140.26)  your love, we may be counted now and until the day of eternity, among the members of\n(1140.26, 1145.72)  your Son, in whose body and blood we have communion.\n(1145.72, 1152.12)  Bring your Church, O Lord, to perfect faith and charity, together with Leo, our Pope,\n(1152.12, 1156.68)  Bishop of Boston, all the bishops, priests, deacons, and the entire people you have made\n(1156.68, 1164.44)  your own. Open our eyes to the needs of our brothers and sisters. Inspire in us\n(1164.44, 1172.04)  words and actions to comfort those who labor and are burdened. Make us serve\n(1172.04, 1177.84)  them truly after the example of Christ and at his command. And may your church\n(1177.84, 1184.72)  stand as a living witness to truth and freedom, to peace and justice, that all\n(1184.72, 1190.66)  people may be raised up to a new hope. Remember our brothers and sisters who\n(1190.66, 1195.3)  have fallen asleep in the peace of your Christ and all the dead whose faith you\n(1195.3, 1201.58)  alone have known. Admit them to rejoice in the light of your face and in the\n(1201.58, 1208.26)  resurrection give them the fullness of life. Grant also to us when our earthly\n(1208.26, 1213.74)  pilgrimage is done that we may come to an eternal dwelling place and live with\n(1213.74, 1219.84)  you forever, there in communion with the Blessed Virgin Mary, the Mother of God, with Saint\n(1219.84, 1226.84)  Joseph her spouse, with your blessed apostles and martyrs, Saint Brigid and all the saints,\n(1227.26, 1234.26)  we shall praise and exult you through Jesus Christ your Son.\n(1236.46, 1242.02)  Through him, with him, and in him, O God Almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, all\n(1242.02, 1246.28)  glory and honor is yours forever and ever.\n(1248.2, 1253.66)  Together now with one heart and one voice as one family let us pray as our\n(1253.66, 1260.2)  brother Jesus taught us. Our Father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy\n(1260.2, 1266.96)  kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven give us this day our\n(1266.96, 1272.38)  daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who\n(1272.38, 1278.8)  trespass against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil.\n(1278.8, 1283.8)  Deliver us Lord we pray from every evil and graciously grant us peace in our\n(1283.8, 1289.32)  days that by the help of your mercy we might be always free from sin and safe\n(1289.32, 1293.6)  from all that distresses us as we await the blessed hope and the coming of our\n(1293.6, 1303.56)  Savior Jesus Christ Lord Jesus Christ who said to your apostles peace I leave\n(1303.56, 1308.84)  you it is my peace that I give to you Lord look not in our sins but on our\n(1308.84, 1313.64)  faith and graciously grant to your church peace and unity in accordance\n(1313.64, 1318.76)  with your will who live and reign forever and ever the peace of the Lord\n(1340.04, 1343.04)  Lamb of God.\n(1348.76, 1358.56)  of the Holy Spirit, through your death give life to the world, free me by this your most\n(1358.56, 1362.8)  holy body and blood from all of my sins and from every evil, keep me always faithful to\n(1362.8, 1373.08)  your commandments and never let me be parted from you.\n(1373.08, 1376.0)  Behold the Lamb of God.\n(1376.0, 1379.32)  Behold Him who takes away the sins of the world.\n(1379.32, 1383.08)  How blessed are we who have been called to share in this banquet.\n(1383.08, 1389.28)  Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof, but only say the word and my\n(1389.28, 1390.28)  soul shall be healed.\n(1390.28, 1393.88)  May the body and blood of Jesus Christ keep us safe everlasting.\n(1463.08, 1464.08)  Amen.\n(1464.08, 1465.08)  Amen.\n(1465.08, 1466.08)  Amen.\n(1466.08, 1467.08)  Amen.\n(1467.08, 1468.08)  Amen.\n(1468.08, 1469.08)  Amen.\n(1469.08, 1470.08)  Amen.\n(1470.08, 1471.08)  Amen.\n(1471.08, 1472.08)  Amen.\n(1472.08, 1473.08)  Amen.\n(1473.08, 1474.08)  Amen.\n(1474.08, 1475.08)  Amen.\n(1475.08, 1476.08)  Amen.\n(1476.08, 1477.08)  Amen.\n(1477.08, 1478.08)  Amen.\n(1478.08, 1479.08)  Amen.\n(1479.08, 1480.08)  Amen.\n(1480.08, 1481.08)  Amen.\n(1481.08, 1482.08)  Amen.\n(1482.08, 1483.08)  Amen.\n(1483.08, 1484.08)  Amen.\n(1484.08, 1485.08)  Amen.\n(1485.08, 1486.08)  Amen.\n(1486.08, 1487.08)  Amen.\n(1487.08, 1488.08)  Amen.\n(1488.08, 1489.08)  Amen.\n(1489.08, 1490.08)  Amen.\n(1490.08, 1491.08)  Amen.\n(1609.08, 1639.0)  Oh, Jerusalem, glorify the Lord who gives you.\n(1639.0, 1645.4)  your fill of finest wheat.

The Lord be with\n(1660.84, 1665.76)  you. May Almighty God bless you and all those entrusted to your care, the Father,\n(1665.76, 1671.58)  the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

The Mass today is for this Wednesday in the\n(333.36, 340.36)  19th week of ordinary time. We're offering the Mass this morning for Buddy Erna and Kristen\n(340.68, 347.68)  Trail. The entrance sent upon. Look to your covenant, O Lord, and forget not the life\n(350.2, 347.68) \n(353.56, 359.36)  Lord, and forget not the life of your poor ones forever. Arise, O God, and defend your cause and forget not the cries\n(359.36, 362.4)  of those who seek you.\n(362.4, 366.16)  Brothers and sisters, let us acknowledge our sins\n(366.16, 371.24)  and so prepare ourselves to celebrate the sacred mysteries.\n(377.68, 384.68)  Have mercy on us, O God, for we have sinned against you.\n(384.68, 390.68)  Show us, O Lord, your mercy and grant us your salvation.\n(390.68, 400.68)  May Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us our sins, and bring us to everlasting life. Amen.\n(400.68, 411.68)  Almighty, ever-living God, who taught by the Holy Spirit we dare to call our Father, bring\n(411.68, 419.68)  we pray to perfection in our hearts the spirit of adoption as your sons and daughters, that\n(419.68, 425.8)  we may merit to enter into the inheritance which you have promised through our Lord Jesus\n(425.8, 434.8)  Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God forever and ever.\n(451.8, 434.8) \n(457.6, 463.76)  A reading from the book of Deuteronomy. Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, the headland of Pisgah, which faces\n(463.76, 472.24)  Jericho, and the Lord showed him all the land, Gildei, and as far as Dan at Naphtali, the\n(472.24, 478.2)  land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah as far as the western sea, then\n(478.2, 486.92)  Egypt, the circuit of Jordan, with the lowlands at Jericho, city of Palms, and as far as Zoah.\n(486.92, 493.64)  The Lord then said to him, This is the land, which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,\n(493.64, 496.68)  I would give to their descendants.\n(496.68, 501.48)  I have let you feast your eyes upon it, but you shall not cross over.\n(501.48, 508.2)  So there in the land of Moab, Moses the servant of the Lord died, as the Lord had said, and\n(508.2, 513.46)  he was buried in the raven opposite Bethphor in the land of Moab.\n(513.46, 517.08)  But to this day no one knows the place of his burial.\n(517.08, 524.04)  Moses was 120 years old when he died, yet his eyes were undimmed and his vigor unabated.\n(524.04, 530.42)  For thirty days the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plans of Moab, till they\n(530.42, 535.88)  had completed the period of grief and mourning for Moses.\n(535.88, 541.88)  Now Joshua, son of Nun, was filled with the spirit of wisdom, since Moses had laid his\n(541.88, 548.84)  hands upon him, and so the children of Israel gave him their obedience, thus carrying out\n(548.84, 551.72)  the Lord's command to Moses.\n(551.72, 558.72)  Since then no prophet has risen in Israel like Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face.\n(558.72, 561.96)  He had no equal in all the signs and wonders.\n(561.96, 567.76)  The Lord sent him to perform in the land of Egypt against Pharaoh, in all his servants\n(567.76, 574.08)  and against all his land, and for the might and the terrifying power that Moses exhibited\n(574.08, 578.92)  in the sight of all of Israel.\n(578.92, 580.92)  The word of the Lord.\n(580.92, 583.2)  Thanks be to God.\n(583.2, 584.8)  Responsorial sound.\n(584.8, 588.6)  Blessed be God who filled my soul with fire.\n(588.6, 591.76)  Blessed be God who filled my soul with fire.\n(591.76, 594.68)  Shout joyfully to God, all the earth.\n(594.68, 600.1)  Sing praise to the glory of his name, Proclaim his glorious praise,\n(600.1, 607.48)  Say to God, How tremendous are your deeds, Blessed be God who filled my soul with fire.\n(607.48, 612.92)  Come and see the works of God, His tremendous deeds among the children of Adam,\n(612.92, 616.72)  Bless our God, you peoples, loudly sound his praise,\n(616.72, 621.46)  Blessed be the God who filled my soul with fire.\n(621.46, 626.88)  Fear now, all you who fear God, while I declare what he has done for me.\n(626.88, 631.58)  When I appealed to his words, praise was on the tip of my tongue.\n(631.58, 635.98)  Blessed be the face of God who filled my soul with fire.\n(651.46, 673.64)  Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah.\n(673.64, 679.26)  God was reconciling the world to Himself in Christ,\n(679.26, 693.22)  And entrusting to us the message of reconciliation, Alleluia, Alleluia.\n(693.22, 695.78)  The Lord be with you.\n(695.78, 702.42)  A reading from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew.\n(702.42, 707.1)  Jesus said to his disciples,\n(707.1, 714.62)  If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault between you and him alone.\n(714.62, 718.58)  If he listens to you, you have won over your brother.\n(718.58, 725.52)  If he does not listen, take one or two others along with you, so that every fact may be\n(725.52, 731.18)  established on the testimony of two or three witnesses.\n(731.18, 735.74)  If he refuses to listen to them, tell the Church.\n(735.74, 741.66)  If he refuses to listen even to the Church, then treat him as you would a Gentile or a\n(741.66, 743.22)  tax collector.\n(743.22, 746.78)  Amen, I say to you.\n(746.78, 752.58)  Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth\n(752.58, 754.38)  shall be loosed in heaven.\n(754.38, 761.38)  Again, amen, I say to you, if two of you agree on earth about anything for which they are\n(762.06, 768.46)  to pray, it shall be granted to them by my Heavenly Father. For where two or three are\n(768.46, 775.46)  gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them. The Gospel of the Lord.\n(782.34, 775.46) \n(786.8, 796.8)  the gospel of the Lord it's the last line of that gospel I think that we should focus upon and reflect upon and pray over with great gratitude to God\n(796.8, 804.44)  for where two or three are gathered together in my name there am I in the\n(804.44, 813.96)  midst of them. There are more than two or three of us here today but we are gathered to give glory\n(813.96, 822.92)  and praise to God and we are also joined by only only God knows how many people that may be\n(822.92, 831.4)  listening to us and celebrating with us this Eucharist through this streaming system. I am never\n(832.44, 831.4) \n(843.36, 850.36)  able to grasp the special aspect of that particular situation to think that we can be gathered here in the church this morning, this beautiful church, almost\n(850.36, 857.52)  like a basilica actually, and to know that as we celebrate the Eucharist there\n(857.52, 862.52)  there are unknown numbers listening to and praying with us\n(862.68, 865.32)  through that streaming system.\n(865.32, 868.32)  I know that for a fact, as I've told you before,\n(868.32, 872.64)  because I have heard, unbelievably,\n(872.64, 877.12)  I have heard from people from faraway places\n(877.12, 881.84)  who have written notes to me as a celebrant\n(881.84, 884.56)  on this particular day, and I'm presuming that happens\n(884.56, 886.92)  perhaps with other priests as well,\n(886.92, 890.32)  because this mass is streamed every day.\n(890.32, 895.32)  And I'm very conscious, and I encourage you to be so,\n(895.62, 899.04)  of the fact that there are others whom we cannot see,\n(899.04, 901.58)  but who are praying with us.\n(901.58, 904.76)  And here we have the words from Jesus himself,\n(904.76, 908.7)  where two or three are gathered together in my name,\n(908.7, 912.18)  there am I in the midst of them.\n(913.38, 913.14) \n(922.5, 924.34)  How blessed we are to know that Jesus is with us as we offer this holy sacrifice of the mass to him,\n(934.42, 941.38)  and with him, and for him, and by him. All those various aspects of the celebration of the Eucharist day after day and to know that every single time, because we are\n(942.18, 947.18)  in numbers, gathered together as He is here in our midst.\n(950.5, 955.5)  How blessed and fortunate we are.\n(957.18, 961.18)  And may we never forget that Jesus is here\n(961.18, 965.32)  in a very real way in our midst.\n(968.04, 970.58)  We pray today for our deceased loved ones,\n(970.58, 974.18)  our benefactors, relatives, and friends,\n(974.18, 976.86)  for those for whom we have been asked to pray,\n(976.86, 980.06)  and especially for Buddy Erna and Christian Trejo,\n(980.06, 982.46)  for whom the Mass is being offered.\n(982.46, 984.18)  Let us pray to the Lord.\n(986.54, 988.4)  We pray for those who have no one else\n(988.4, 991.54)  to pray for them except us,\n(991.54, 994.48)  and those who have asked us to pray for them.\n(994.48, 996.46)  Let us pray to the Lord.\n(998.2, 996.46) \n(1004.18, 1007.02)  We pray for all those who today celebrate their birthday, that God may reward them and bless them in a special way.\n(1007.02, 1011.1)  Let us pray to the Lord.\n(1011.1, 1016.48)  We pray for an increase in vocations to the priesthood and religious life, particularly\n(1016.48, 1020.38)  from among the families of our own parish.\n(1020.38, 1023.5)  From whence vocations come.\n(1023.5, 1031.7)  us pray to the Lord. We pray for peace in the world and especially that God will\n(1031.7, 1039.14)  help those who are living in areas in our world in which there is no peace at\n(1039.14, 1047.14)  the moment, but only war and sadness and death. That only our Blessed Lord himself,\n(1047.14, 1056.14)  who can solve all problems, will find a way for peace in all those troubled places.\n(1056.14, 1059.14)  Let us pray to the Lord.\n(1060.14, 1067.14)  We pray for a deeper understanding and a greater appreciation of the sacredness of all human life,\n(1067.14, 1072.14)  from the first moment of conception to the last moment of natural death.\n(1072.14, 1075.14)  Let us pray to the Lord.\n(1076.14, 1075.14) \n(1083.14, 1086.14)  And we pray for all our own personal needs and intentions that we've kept quietly today in our hearts. Let us pray to the Lord.\n(1086.14, 1092.14)  O God, we ask you to hear these petitions in request of ours.\n(1092.14, 1098.14)  We know that you are here in our midst and that you hear us.\n(1098.14, 1100.14)  Amen.\n(1135.14, 1150.78)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through your goodness we have received\n(1150.78, 1157.34)  the bread we offer you, fruit of the earth and work of human hands, it will become for\n(1157.34, 1164.34)  us the bread of life. By the mystery of this water and wine may we come to share in the\n(1166.06, 1173.06)  divinity of Christ who humbled himself to share in our humanity. Blessed are you, Lord\n(1183.06, 1173.06) \n(1187.14, 1193.72)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through your goodness we have received the wine we offer you, fruit of the vine, and work of human hands, it will become our\n(1193.72, 1198.0)  spiritual drink.\n(1198.0, 1200.94)  with humble spirit and contrite heart,\n(1200.94, 1203.82)  may we be accepted by you, O Lord,\n(1203.82, 1207.14)  and may our sacrifice in your sight this day\n(1207.14, 1210.82)  be pleasing to you, Lord God.\n(1210.82, 1213.62)  Wash me, O Lord, from my iniquity\n(1213.62, 1216.32)  and cleanse me from my sin.\n(1228.0, 1248.82)  Pray, brothers and sisters, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God, the almighty\n(1248.82, 1263.66)  Father, be pleased, O Lord, to accept the offerings of your Church, for in your mercy\n(1263.66, 1270.94)  you have given them to be offered, and by your power you transform them into the mystery\n(1270.94, 1276.26)  of our salvation through Christ our Lord.\n(1276.26, 1286.1)  Lord be with you. Lift up your hearts. Let us give thanks to the Lord our God. It is\n(1286.1, 1292.22)  truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, always and everywhere, to give\n(1292.22, 1298.54)  you thanks, Lord, Holy Father, Almighty and Eternal God. For although you have no\n(1298.54, 1304.94)  need of our praise, yet our thanksgiving is itself your gift.\n(1304.94, 1314.94)  Since our praises add nothing to Your greatness, but profit us for salvation through Christ our Lord.\n(1314.94, 1322.94)  And so, in company with the choirs of angels, we praise You, and with joy we proclaim,\n(1322.94, 1331.94)  Holy, holy, holy Lord God of hosts, heaven and earth are full of Your glory, Hosanna in the highest.\n(1331.94, 1339.94)  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, Hosanna in the highest.\n(1339.94, 1344.94)  You are indeed holy, O Lord, the fount of all holiness.\n(1344.94, 1351.94)  Make holy, therefore, these gifts, we pray, by sending down your Spirit upon them like the dewfall,\n(1351.94, 1359.94)  so that they may become for us the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.\n(1359.94, 1370.94)  At the time he was betrayed and entered willingly into his passion, he took bread and giving thanks, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying,\n(1370.94, 1380.94)  Take this, all of you, and eat of it, for this is my body which will be given up for you.\n(1389.94, 1403.7)  In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took the chalice, and once more giving thanks,\n(1403.7, 1409.62)  he gave it to his disciples, saying, Take this, all of you, and drink from it, for this\n(1409.62, 1416.9)  is the chalice of my blood, the blood of the new and eternal covenant, which will be poured\n(1416.9, 1421.9)  out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins.\n(1422.86, 1426.02)  Do this in memory of me.\n(1429.06, 1430.9)  The mystery of faith.\n(1446.9, 1451.9)  Faith, save us, savior of the world,\n(1451.94, 1456.94)  for by your cross and resurrection, you have set us free.\n(1457.62, 1459.86)  Therefore, as we celebrate the memorial\n(1459.86, 1463.42)  of his death and resurrection, we offer you, Lord,\n(1463.42, 1466.72)  the bread of life and the chalice of salvation,\n(1466.72, 1470.44)  giving thanks that you have held us worthy\n(1470.44, 1475.06)  to be in your presence and minister to you.\n(1475.06, 1481.38)  Humbly we pray that, partaking of the body and blood of Christ, we may be gathered into\n(1481.38, 1485.26)  one by the Holy Spirit.\n(1485.26, 1489.86)  Remember Lord your Church, spread throughout the world, and bring her to the fullness of\n(1489.86, 1499.7)  charity together, with Leo our Pope, and Richard our Bishop, and all the clergy.\n(1499.7, 1506.7)  Remember your servants, Buddy Erna and Kristin Traill, whom you have called from this world\n(1507.98, 1514.7)  to yourself. Grant that they who were united with your son in a death like his may also\n(1514.7, 1521.7)  be one with him in his resurrection. Remember also our brothers and sisters who have fallen\n(1522.74, 1529.58)  asleep in the hope of the resurrection and all who have died in your mercy. Welcome them\n(1529.58, 1532.7)  into the light of your face.\n(1532.7, 1534.74)  Have mercy on us all, we pray,\n(1534.74, 1538.78)  that with the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God,\n(1538.78, 1541.14)  with blessed Josephus' bows,\n(1541.14, 1544.58)  with the blessed apostles and all the saints\n(1544.58, 1547.58)  who have pleased you throughout the ages,\n(1547.58, 1551.14)  we may merit to be coheirs to eternal life\n(1551.14, 1553.78)  and may praise and glorify you\n(1553.78, 1557.42)  through your Son, Jesus Christ.\n(1558.96, 1557.42) \n(1580.42, 1591.42)  Through Him and with Him and in Him, O God Almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, all glory and honor is Yours forever and ever. Amen. At the Saviour's command, informed by divine teaching, we dare to say Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy Name.\n(1591.42, 1597.42)  Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.\n(1597.42, 1606.42)  Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.\n(1606.42, 1612.42)  and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.\n(1612.42, 1616.42)  Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil.\n(1616.42, 1621.42)  Graciously grant peace in our days, that by the help of your mercy,\n(1621.42, 1627.42)  we may be always free from sin and safe from all distress,\n(1627.42, 1633.42)  as we await the blessed hope and the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ.\n(1633.42, 1638.42)  For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and forever.\n(1638.42, 1641.42)  Lord Jesus Christ, who said to your Apostles,\n(1641.42, 1645.42)  Peace I leave you, my peace I give you.\n(1645.42, 1649.42)  Look not on our sins, but on the faith of your Church,\n(1649.42, 1655.42)  and graciously grant her peace and unity in accordance with your will,\n(1655.42, 1659.42)  who live and reign forever and ever. Amen.\n(1659.42, 1663.42)  The peace of the Lord be with you always.\n(1663.42, 1668.42)  Let us offer each other some sign of peace.\n(1681.42, 1687.42)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1687.42, 1693.42)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1693.42, 1701.42)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, grant us peace.\n(1701.42, 1706.42)  We are mindful, as always, of the people who are with us through the streaming system,\n(1706.42, 1708.42)  whom I've already mentioned.\n(1708.42, 1723.06)  We pray with them that they may make a perfect act of spiritual act of prayer before the\n(1723.06, 1728.06)  Eucharist they're not able to receive as we do here in the church because they're in their\n(1728.06, 1735.18)  own homes, but they can make a spiritual act of Holy Communion as we encourage them and\n(1735.18, 1742.18)  ourselves. By this prayer, may the receiving of your body and blood, Lord Jesus Christ,\n(1742.18, 1749.18)  not bring us to judgment and condemnation, but through your loving mercy be for us protection\n(1749.74, 1756.74)  in mind and body and a healing remedy. Behold the Lamb of God.

        "transcript": "(90.0, 97.0)  So, thank you very much for joining us today, and we'll see you in the next session.\n(269.0, 276.92)  Good morning everyone, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,\n(276.92, 281.36)  the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy\n(281.36, 284.92)  Spirit be with all of you.\n(284.92, 288.96)  Today we celebrate the Feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary.\n(288.96, 296.16)  As we honor Mary today, we ask the Lord's forgiveness for our sins.\n(296.16, 303.4)  I confess to Almighty God, and to you my brothers and sisters, that I have greatly sinned, in\n(303.4, 309.74)  my thoughts and in my words, in what I have done and what I have failed to do, through\n(309.74, 314.6)  my fault, through my fault, through my most grievous fault.\n(314.6, 320.92)  Therefore I ask Blessed Mary ever-Virgin, all the Angels and Saints, and you my brothers\n(320.92, 324.98)  and sisters, to pray for me to the Lord our God.\n(324.98, 332.04)  May Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us our sins, and bring us to everlasting life.\n(332.04, 337.84)  Glory to God in the highest and on earth, peace to people of good will.\n(337.84, 342.6)  We praise you, we bless you, we adore you, we glorify you.\n(342.6, 350.4)  We give you thanks for your great glory, Lord God, Heavenly King, O God Almighty Father.\n(350.4, 357.68)  Jesus Christ, only begotten Son, Lord God, Lamb of God, Son of the Father, you take\n(357.68, 363.48)  away the sins of the world, have mercy on us. You take away the sins of the world,\n(363.48, 369.64)  receive our prayer. You are seated at the right hand of the Father, have mercy on\n(369.64, 375.6)  us. For you alone are the Holy One, you alone are the Lord, you alone are the\n(375.6, 383.2)  Most High, Jesus Christ, with the Holy Spirit, in the glory of God the Father, amen.\n(383.2, 386.6)  Let us pray.\n(386.6, 392.88)  Almighty ever-living God, who assumed the Immaculate Virgin Mary, the Mother of your\n(392.88, 401.24)  Son, body and soul, into heavenly glory, grant, we pray, that, always attentive to the things\n(401.24, 406.8)  that are above, we may merit to be sharers of her glory.\n(406.8, 411.16)  Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of\n(411.16, 428.6)  the Holy Spirit, God forever and ever.\n(428.6, 433.44)  reading from the book of Revelation. God's temple in heaven was opened and\n(433.44, 438.2)  the ark of his covenant could be seen in the temple. A great sign appeared in the\n(438.2, 442.84)  sky, a woman clothed with the Sun with the moon under her feet and on her head\n(442.84, 448.56)  a crown of 12 stars. She was with child and wailed aloud in pain as she labored\n(448.56, 454.08)  to give birth. Then another sign appeared in the sky. It was a huge red dragon with\n(454.08, 459.8)  seven heads and ten horns, and on its heads were seven diadems.\n(459.8, 465.0)  Its tail swept away a third of the stars in the sky and hurled them down to the earth.\n(465.0, 469.26)  Then the dragon stood before the woman about to give birth to devour her child when she\n(469.26, 470.9)  gave birth.\n(470.9, 477.06)  She gave birth to a son, a male child, destined to rule all the nations with an iron rod.\n(477.06, 480.12)  Her child was caught up to God in his throne.\n(480.12, 485.14)  The woman herself fled into the desert, where she had a place prepared by God.\n(485.14, 490.76)  Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say, Now have salvation and power come, and the kingdom\n(490.76, 493.94)  of our God, and the authority of his anointed one.\n(493.94, 498.42)  The word of the Lord.\n(498.42, 507.58)  The queen stands at your right hand, arrayed in gold.\n(507.58, 509.86)  The queen takes her place at your right hand\n(509.86, 511.14)  in gold of Ophir.\n(516.04, 518.7)  Hear, oh daughter in sea, turn your ear,\n(518.7, 521.18)  forget your people and your father's house.\n(525.98, 529.46)  So shall the king desire your beauty, for he is your lord.\n(534.52, 536.8)  They are born and with gladness and joy,\n(536.8, 544.56)  enter the palace of the King.\n(544.56, 548.88)  A reading from the First Letter of St. Paul to the Corinthians.\n(548.88, 553.72)  Brothers and Sisters, Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who\n(553.72, 555.44)  have fallen asleep.\n(555.44, 560.92)  For since death came through man, the resurrection of the dead came also through man.\n(560.92, 566.4)  For just as in Adam all die, so too in Christ shall all be brought to life.\n(566.4, 573.96)  each one in proper order. Christ the firstfruits, then at his coming those who belong to Christ,\n(573.96, 578.66)  then comes the end, when he hands over the kingdom to his God and Father, when he has\n(578.66, 584.44)  destroyed every sovereignty and every authority and power. For he must reign until he has\n(584.44, 590.64)  put all his enemies under his feet. The last enemy to be destroyed is death, for he subjected\n(590.64, 595.4)  everything under his feet. The word of the Lord.\n(616.6, 595.4) \n(620.2, 624.32)  The Lord be with you. A reading from the Holy Gospel according to Luke.\n(624.32, 626.98)  Glory to the Lord.\n(626.98, 630.62)  Mary set out and traveled to the hill country in haste\n(630.62, 635.36)  to a town of Judah, where she entered the house of Zechariah\n(635.36, 637.88)  and greeted Elizabeth.\n(637.88, 640.9)  When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting,\n(640.9, 645.38)  the infant leapt in her womb, and Elizabeth,\n(645.38, 649.06)  filled with the Holy Spirit, cried out in a loud voice\n(649.06, 652.78)  and said, blessed are you among women,\n(652.78, 656.22)  and blessed is the fruit of your womb.\n(656.22, 657.98)  And how does this happen to me\n(657.98, 661.98)  that the mother of my Lord should come to me?\n(661.98, 664.58)  For at the moment the sound of your greeting\n(664.58, 669.58)  reached my ears, the infant in my womb leapt for joy.\n(670.98, 674.82)  Blessed are you who believed that what was spoken to you\n(674.82, 677.3)  by the Lord would be fulfilled.\n(678.26, 677.3) \n(685.94, 693.58)  and Mary said my soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord my spirit rejoices in God my Savior for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant from this day\n(693.58, 699.34)  all generations will call me blessed the Almighty has done great things from me\n(699.34, 707.14)  me, and holy is his name. He has mercy on those who fear him in every generation.\n(707.14, 713.02)  He has shown the strength of his arm, and has scattered the proud in their\n(713.02, 720.58)  conceit. He has cast down the mighty from their thrones, and has lifted up the lowly.\n(720.58, 725.98)  He has filled the hungry with good things, and the rich he has sent away\n(725.98, 732.26)  way empty. He has come to the help of his servant Israel, for he has remembered his\n(732.26, 741.66)  promise of mercy, the promise he made to our fathers, to Abraham and his children forever.\n(741.66, 747.62)  Mary remained with her about three months and then returned to her home.\n(747.62, 756.58)  The Gospel of the Lord.\n(756.58, 762.48)  Today the Church lifts her eyes to heaven, celebrating the assumption of the Blessed\n(762.48, 768.0)  Virgin Mary, body and soul, into the glory of God.\n(768.0, 776.52)  In our Gospel this morning we hear of Mary setting out in haste to visit her cousin Elizabeth.\n(776.52, 783.14)  moment Mary carrying the Son of God within her foreshadows the very truth we\n(783.14, 790.44)  honor today where Christ is there too is his mother sharing fully in his victory.\n(790.44, 796.26)  Mary's journey to Elizabeth is not one of self-display but of service. She has\n(796.26, 802.06)  just heard the most astounding message from the angel that she will bear the\n(802.06, 810.18)  Messiah, the Son of God, and yet her first instinct is to go and help someone else.\n(810.18, 816.14)  In the Magnificat that we heard in that gospel today, she magnifies the Lord, not\n(816.14, 824.94)  herself. Her eyes, her heart, and life are turned entirely toward God. Her voice\n(824.94, 831.74)  causes John the Baptist to leap in the womb of her cousin Elizabeth, and Mary's\n(831.74, 838.36)  presence becomes a vessel of joy. And that is Mary's way, never seeking the\n(838.36, 845.76)  spotlight but always bringing Christ to others. The assumption that we celebrate\n(845.76, 854.48)  today is heaven's reply to the humble yes that Mary gave in Nazareth. The God\n(854.48, 863.42)  who once took his dwelling in her now takes her into his dwelling forever. No\n(863.42, 869.7)  corruption could touch the body that bore the life of Christ itself. And the\n(869.7, 875.28)  assumption is not just about Mary's privilege, it's about our destiny also.\n(875.28, 882.44)  This feast is not only about her, it's about us. In her God shows us the\n(882.44, 888.62)  fulfillment of his promise that those who love him and say yes to him like\n(888.62, 895.98)  Mary did will share in his resurrection. Mary is the first to follow her son\n(895.98, 903.98)  completely into heavenly glory and she is our sign of hope for the same. What\n(903.98, 911.22)  God did for Mary he desires to do for us. Let's remember that the assumption is\n(911.22, 917.72)  is not only about the end of Mary's life, it's about the destiny God has prepared\n(917.72, 926.48)  for every faithful soul. Today then we are invited to live as Mary lived,\n(926.48, 936.0)  carrying Christ into the world through acts of love, magnifying the Lord in our\n(936.0, 943.0)  words and deeds and trusting that one day by his grace we too will be brought\n(943.0, 952.28)  into his eternal presence like Mary was. So holy Mary assumed into heaven pray\n(952.28, 962.56)  for us today that we may one day join you there. Let us pray. And on this great\n(962.56, 967.72)  feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, we lift our hearts to God,\n(967.72, 974.56)  trusting in His mercy and His love. We pray for the Church this morning, that\n(974.56, 980.04)  inspired by Mary's faith and obedience, all members of the Church may bear\n(980.04, 988.44)  Christ's light to the world with joy and courage. We pray to the Lord for peace in\n(988.44, 996.28)  our world, that leaders of nations will put aside differences, seek understanding, and\n(996.28, 1004.8)  work together for justice and lasting peace, especially today as President Putin and President\n(1004.8, 1007.56)  Trump meet in Alaska.\n(1007.56, 1016.88)  We pray to the Lord for families, that following Mary's example of love and care, our homes\n(1016.88, 1024.14)  may be places of welcome respect and faith we pray to the Lord for those in\n(1024.14, 1029.38)  need the poor the sick and the lonely that they may know the comfort of God's\n(1029.38, 1036.32)  presence and the support of our community we pray to the Lord for all\n(1036.32, 1040.94)  the sick those in hospital or nursing home those undergoing surgery or\n(1040.94, 1045.78)  treatment today that God's healing presence may be with them we pray to the\n(1045.78, 1052.98)  Lord and for our beloved dead our families friends and parishioners that\n(1052.98, 1058.02)  they may share in the glory promised to all who follow Christ with Mary and all\n(1058.02, 1064.62)  the Saints we pray to the Lord loving father you raise the Blessed Virgin Mary\n(1064.62, 1069.64)  body and soul into the glory of heaven hear our prayers today and grant that we\n(1069.64, 1075.24)  too may one day share in your eternal joy we ask these prayers through Christ\n(1075.24, 1078.24)  our Lord.\n(1105.24, 1113.62)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through your goodness we have received\n(1113.62, 1117.7)  the bread we offer you, fruit of the earth and work of human hands.\n(1117.7, 1122.64)  It will become for us the bread of life.\n(1122.64, 1127.14)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through your goodness we have received\n(1127.14, 1131.22)  the wine we offer you, fruit of the vine and work of human hands.\n(1131.22, 1133.72)  it will become our spiritual drink.\n(1133.72, 1135.72)  Bless us, O God our Lord.\n(1148.1, 1151.68)  Pray, brothers and sisters, that my sacrifice and yours\n(1151.68, 1155.34)  may be acceptable to God, the almighty Father.\n(1155.34, 1158.34)  The Lord accept the sacrifice at your hands,\n(1158.34, 1163.62)  Praise the glory of his name, for our good and the good of all his holy Church.\n(1163.62, 1169.86)  May this oblation, our tribute of homage, rise up to you, O Lord, and through the intercession\n(1169.86, 1175.58)  of the Most Blessed Virgin Mary, whom you assumed into heaven, may our hearts, aflame\n(1175.58, 1182.14)  with the fire of love, constantly long for you, through Christ our Lord.\n(1182.14, 1184.86)  The Lord be with you.\n(1184.86, 1187.42)  Lift up your hearts.\n(1187.42, 1191.56)  Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.\n(1191.56, 1197.0)  It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, always and everywhere, to give\n(1197.0, 1203.48)  you thanks, Lord Holy Father, Almighty and Eternal God, through Christ our Lord.\n(1203.48, 1209.8)  For today the Virgin Mother of God was assumed into heaven, as the beginning and image of\n(1209.8, 1216.1)  your Church is coming to perfection, and a sign of sure hope and comfort to your pilgrim\n(1216.1, 1222.98)  people. Rightly you would not allow her to see the corruption of the tomb, since\n(1222.98, 1228.18)  from her own body she marvelously brought forth your incarnate Son, the\n(1228.18, 1233.74)  author of all life. And so in company with the choirs of angels we praise you\n(1233.74, 1242.54)  and with joy we now proclaim, holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts, heaven and earth\n(1242.54, 1248.76)  are full of your glory, Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he who comes in the\n(1248.76, 1253.64)  name of the Lord, Hosanna in the highest.\n(1253.88, 1259.88)  You are indeed holy, O Lord, the fount of all holiness. Make holy therefore these\n(1259.88, 1265.52)  gifts, we pray, by sending down your Spirit upon them like the dewfall, so\n(1265.52, 1271.08)  that they may become for us the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ. At the\n(1271.08, 1276.6)  time he was betrayed and entered willingly into his passion he took bread\n(1276.6, 1282.48)  and giving thanks broke it and gave it to his disciples saying take this all of\n(1282.48, 1289.68)  you and eat of it for this is my body which will be given up for you.\n(1296.4, 1289.68) \n(1301.72, 1307.64)  in a similar way when supper was ended he took the chalice and once more giving thanks he gave the cup to his disciples saying take this all of you and drink\n(1307.64, 1312.0)  from it for this is the chalice of my blood the blood of the new and eternal\n(1312.0, 1316.92)  covenant which will be poured out for you and for many for the forgiveness of\n(1316.92, 1333.24)  sins. Do this in memory of me. The mystery of faith. When we eat this bread and\n(1333.24, 1340.56)  drink this cup, we proclaim your death, O Lord, until you come again. Therefore, as\n(1340.56, 1344.92)  we celebrate the memorial of his death and resurrection, we offer you, Lord, the\n(1344.92, 1349.88)  bread of life and the chalice of salvation, giving thanks that you have\n(1349.88, 1355.52)  held us worthy to be in your presence and minister to you. Humbly we pray that\n(1355.52, 1360.2)  partaking of the body and blood of Christ we may be gathered into one by\n(1360.2, 1366.04)  the Holy Spirit. And remember Lord your church spread throughout the world and\n(1366.04, 1371.7)  bring her to the fullness of charity together with Leo our Pope and Richard\n(1371.7, 1377.4)  our bishop and all the clergy. Remember also our brothers and sisters who have\n(1377.4, 1382.62)  fallen asleep in the hope of the resurrection and all who have died in\n(1382.62, 1390.18)  your mercy. Welcome them into the light of your face. Have mercy on us all, we\n(1390.18, 1396.48)  pray, that with the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God, St. Joseph, her spouse with\n(1396.48, 1401.88)  the Blessed Apostles, St. Bridget, St. Augustine, and all the Saints who have\n(1401.88, 1407.2)  pleased you throughout the ages that we may merit to be co-heirs to eternal life\n(1407.2, 1413.88)  and may praise and glorify you through your Son Jesus Christ. Through him and\n(1413.88, 1418.24)  with him and in him, O God Almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit\n(1418.24, 1425.08)  all glory and honor is yours forever and ever.\n(1426.48, 1432.48)  At the Savior's command, informed by divine teaching, we dare to pray now.\n(1432.48, 1436.48)  Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.\n(1436.48, 1442.48)  Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.\n(1442.48, 1447.48)  Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses,\n(1447.48, 1451.48)  as we forgive those who trespass against us,\n(1451.48, 1457.28)  us, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.\n(1457.28, 1462.72)  Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil, graciously grant peace in our days, that by\n(1462.72, 1468.92)  the help of your mercy we may be always free from sin and safe from all distress, as we\n(1468.92, 1473.36)  await the blessed hope in the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ.\n(1473.36, 1478.12)  The Kingdom, the power, and the glory are with us now and forever.\n(1478.12, 1483.06)  Jesus Christ who said to your apostles peace I leave you my peace I give you\n(1483.06, 1487.86)  look not now on our sins but on the faith of your church and graciously\n(1487.86, 1492.9)  grant her peace and unity in accordance with your will live and reign forever\n(1492.9, 1499.94)  and ever the peace of the Lord be with you always let's offer each other some\n(1499.94, 1503.38)  sign of Christ's peace\n(1508.12, 1525.32)  LAMB OF GOD, YOU TAKE AWAY THE SINS OF THE WORLD, HAVE MERCY ON US.\n(1525.32, 1530.72)  LAMB OF GOD, YOU TAKE AWAY THE SINS OF THE WORLD, HAVE MERCY ON US.\n(1530.72, 1535.16)  LAMB OF GOD, YOU TAKE AWAY THE SINS OF THE WORLD, GRANT US PEACE.\n(1538.12, 1549.56)  Behold, the Lamb of God, behold Him who takes away the sins of the world.\n(1549.56, 1552.24)  Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb.\n(1552.24, 1558.44)  Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof, but only say the word and my\n(1558.44, 1560.44)  My soul shall be healed.\n(1796.44, 1821.08)  Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee, blessed art thou among women, blessed\n(1821.08, 1823.92)  is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.\n(1823.92, 1830.1)  Mary, Mother of God.

The Gospel of the Lord.\n(631.66, 638.66)  Today's our solemnity. The church\n(638.7, 642.82)  has all these different kinds of celebrations and solemnities are like the\n(642.82, 643.98)  highest ones.\n(643.98, 648.3)  So Easter, every Sunday, Holy Days are solemnities and that's what\n(648.3, 654.3)  today is the assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary.\n(654.3, 657.3)  And we have a lot of images of arcs in our readings.\n(657.3, 664.3)  We have, you know, the arc of the Covenant, we have stuff in the Psalms, you know,\n(664.3, 669.3)  and the Blessed Mother is sort of pitched as an arc herself,\n(669.3, 673.3)  who carries within her the presence of God among us.\n(673.3, 675.3)  But what does that mean for us today?\n(675.3, 677.3)  This idea that the Blessed Virgin Mary, some of you might remember,\n(677.3, 683.3)  As many of you might remember, we used to have a memorial called the Dormition of the Blessed Mother.\n(683.3, 689.3)  It's the same kind of thing, where she fell asleep and kind of went to God, body and soul.\n(689.3, 691.3)  And that's portrayed in all kinds of ways in art.\n(691.3, 697.3)  And all of them are just really beautiful and usually have her surrounded by the apostles.\n(697.3, 700.3)  A real family kind of environment.\n(700.3, 703.3)  And we live today in our families of all different kinds.\n(703.3, 709.06)  I think it's a helpful reminder to us on this celebration that first of all\n(709.74, 711.74)  We're you know, we're reminded that\n(711.94, 715.88)  Death is not done right there. There's heaven is real\n(716.18, 721.26)  Right. That's what one of the things that Blessed Mother the church is trying to remind us that heaven is real that our lives have\n(721.26, 722.3)  meaning\n(722.3, 723.42)  beyond\n(723.42, 728.78)  Today beyond this place in this space and in a world obsessed with all\n(729.62, 731.62)  kinds of externals, you know\n(732.18, 731.62) \n(740.62, 745.62)  youth-like things, or beauty-type things, but on the surface as we get more and more obsessed with surface-type things, we can look to someone like the Blessed Mother who is just as human as anybody else,\n(745.62, 753.62)  and we can see instead of things like obsession around power and those kinds of things,\n(753.62, 759.62)  we can see a person who really finds a real unity and a joy with God.\n(759.62, 762.92)  and living a life of faith and obedience and love.\n(762.92, 767.42)  And in a culture that fears death,\n(767.42, 771.92)  today reminds us that fear is just a feeling.\n(771.92, 774.82)  Feelings aren't right or wrong, they're not good or bad.\n(774.82, 776.12)  They just are.\n(776.12, 778.32)  It's what we do with them that matters.\n(778.32, 782.02)  And so, fear of death is not where it ends.\n(782.02, 783.72)  That it's a defeated thing,\n(783.72, 787.12)  that death, we realize in this kind of celebration,\n(787.12, 790.36)  It's transformational.\n(790.36, 793.2)  It's not an end.\n(793.2, 796.92)  And if we live like Mary, we too will be able to live with Christ forever.\n(796.92, 801.96)  And I think those are kind of the big highlight, like reminders of this celebration, which\n(801.96, 804.92)  is why we have it year after year after year.\n(804.92, 810.86)  Because we have to be reminded that death does not have the final say.\n(810.86, 818.3)  That faith can bring about a life of joy in a way that maybe these other things don't.\n(818.3, 822.0)  And that's why we continue to chase, chase, chase them.\n(822.0, 826.58)  But that inward journey is where we're going to find presence of God.\n(826.58, 829.14)  That's what an ark does.\n(829.14, 832.18)  And of course, most of us, I think, when we think of the ark, I'll leave you with this\n(832.18, 836.26)  image, we tend to think of that first one that we hear about in scripture.\n(836.26, 841.26)  Noah's Ark, right?\n(841.26, 848.26)  And Noah's Ark has, like the Blessed Mother, has been an image of an Ark for the Son of God, the Christ.\n(848.26, 854.26)  Noah's Ark has been used as an example for all of us, the Church.\n(854.26, 857.26)  But the Church is like Noah's Ark.\n(857.26, 862.26)  And I don't know about you, but when I see images of the Arks, they're usually very beautiful, including Noah's Ark.\n(862.26, 866.16)  usually has like a couple of giraffes and a couple of lions and it's like in an infant's\n(866.16, 871.8)  room or something like this and it's very cute and we say like the church is like Noah's\n(871.8, 878.3)  Ark and I would say it is, but that's not what it is. Always we have to take those biblical\n(878.3, 882.6)  images and kind of rub the polish off of them and think about them for what they sounded\n(882.6, 888.52)  like to the people of that time. The Ark at that time, let's face it, a great big huge\n(888.52, 894.7)  wooden building. Picture it. This is your story. You have to get inside of this ark.\n(894.7, 902.04)  Forty days, forty nights, lots of rain, all kinds of animals, no getting out, no indoor\n(902.04, 912.34)  plumbing, and just your family. The church can be like Noah's Ark. Sometimes you can't\n(912.34, 917.44)  stand the smell, but if you get out, you'll drown. We need one another. We are the ark\n(917.44, 922.62)  for each other, and that's why we come and celebrate Jesus' presence among us here\n(922.62, 923.94)  at the Eucharist.\n(923.94, 929.06)  So that we can be fed, so that we can be strengthened, so that we can get those iron sides like our\n(929.06, 930.96)  boat around the corner has, right?\n(930.96, 935.42)  That we can be buffeted so that we can be that ark, not just to carry Christ within\n(935.42, 939.26)  ourselves for ourselves, but to do that for one another.\n(939.26, 941.38)  That's what the Blessed Mother shows us.\n(941.38, 942.38)  May that grace be ours.\n(942.38, 971.38)  Take a moment to make Dr. Askew to point out another answer to the clock.\n(971.38, 981.38)  We pray for our church, all throughout the world, in all the ways that it can add us.\n(981.38, 986.38)  We pray for all those women and men who lead us in the church, especially for our father\n(986.38, 989.38)  for healing and thanksgiving.\n(989.38, 994.38)  We pray for our country, if you might throw in the waves of gospel and peace and justice\n(994.38, 996.38)  and love, we pray for you.\n(996.38, 1000.38)  We pray for all those who have helped us get to this place in our lives.\n(1000.38, 1002.76)  I think it's a place not a lot of us are,\n(1002.76, 1006.92)  but that that we're on is the place we want to be.\n(1006.92, 1009.12)  And we never put that out there.\n(1009.12, 1011.22)  Those we have known and loved,\n(1011.22, 1014.7)  those who see that we have no one left to pray for,\n(1014.7, 1018.34)  those whose power should have been made to stand,\n(1018.34, 1022.08)  and all those we have known to pray for.\n(1022.08, 1023.74)  We gather all our prayers together\n(1023.74, 1026.5)  in the session of God bless the Father of the Great,\n(1026.5, 1034.5)  I am a young man, overrated, a little too, blessed I am, blessed with the love of Jesus,\n(1034.5, 1040.5)  holy and faithful to the Lord God, the Son, and the Son of God.\n(1056.5, 1082.98)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for it is through your goodness that we have\n(1082.98, 1084.98)  received this bread which we now offer to you.\n(1084.98, 1090.98)  It is the fruit of the earth and the work of the man that will become for us the good of life.\n(1107.98, 1111.98)  Blessed are you Lord God of our creation. What is through your goodness that we have received?\n(1111.98, 1139.98)  Pray, my sisters and brothers, that this our sacrifice might be acceptable to God the Almighty\n(1139.98, 1140.98)  Father.\n(1140.98, 1154.98)  May this oblation, our tribute of homage, rise up to you, O Lord, and through the intercession\n(1154.98, 1159.98)  of the Most Blessed Virgin Mary, whom you have assumed unto heaven, may your hearts\n(1159.98, 1165.98)  acclaim and fire above constantly long for you, through Christ our Lord.\n(1165.98, 1167.98)  The Lord be with you.\n(1167.98, 1169.98)  Lift up your hearts.\n(1169.98, 1173.98)  Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.\n(1173.98, 1179.98)  It is true that I did just our duty and our salvation, always and everywhere to give you thanks,\n(1179.98, 1184.98)  Lord, Almighty Father, Eternal God, through Christ our Lord.\n(1184.98, 1192.98)  For today, the Virgin Mother of God is assumed into heaven as the beginning and image of your Church's coming to perfection,\n(1192.98, 1197.98)  and a sign of sure hope and comfort to your filthy people.\n(1197.98, 1208.98)  Rightly, you could not allow her to see the collection of the jewelry, since from her own body, she marvelously brought forth your incarnate son, Robert of Albany.\n(1208.98, 1216.98)  And so, in company of choirs of ignorance, we praise you, and without you, without all joy, we proclaim.\n(1216.98, 1223.82)  Hope, hope, hope, God above us, heaven and earth are full of your glory.\n(1223.82, 1230.26)  For God is our command, our blessing is in your eyes, and in your glory, in your honor and in your might.\n(1233.7, 1238.02)  You are indeed holy and to be glorified, O God, you love to do the praise.\n(1238.02, 1241.94)  And who always walk with us on our journey of life?\n(1241.94, 1245.7)  Blessed indeed is your Son, present in our midst,\n(1245.7, 1251.86)  whenever we are gathered by his love and when as works for his disciples show now for us\n(1251.86, 1258.42)  he opens the scriptures and breaks the bread therefore while the most merciful we ask\n(1260.26, 1264.82)  send forth your holy spirit to sanctify these gifts of bread and wine\n(1266.42, 1270.26)  that they may become the body and blood\n(1272.42, 1270.26) \n(1277.26, 1285.26)  While the Lord Jesus Christ, whose command we can fill whenever we celebrate, is listening. For on the day before he was to suffer, on the night of the Last Supper, Jesus himself took bread into his hands.\n(1285.26, 1291.26)  He said the blessing, broke the bread, and made it with his disciples, saying,\n(1291.26, 1298.26)  Take this, all of you, and eat this, for this is my body, which will be given up for you.\n(1300.26, 1317.26)  In a similar way, when the supper had ended, he took the chalice, and giving the thanks he gave the chalice to his incisal to say,\n(1317.26, 1326.26)  Take this, all of you, and drink it. For this is the chalice of my love, the blood of the new and eternal public,\n(1326.26, 1331.26)  which will be poured out for you and your members in the success.\n(1331.26, 1333.26)  Do this in memory of me.\n",

well pleased.\n(259.98, 262.02)  Listen to him.\n(262.02, 265.96)  In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.\n(265.96, 271.28)  The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit\n(271.28, 274.2)  be with you all.\n(274.2, 278.88)  My sisters and brothers, we gather this morning to celebrate the Feast of the Transfiguration\n(278.88, 280.8)  of the Lord.\n(280.8, 288.24)  Our Mass this morning is offered for the members of the St. Brigid Memorial Society.\n(288.24, 294.44)  I confess to Almighty God and to you, my brothers and sisters, that I have greatly sinned in\n(294.44, 299.52)  my thoughts and in my words, in what I have done and in what I have failed to do, through\n(299.52, 303.76)  my fault, through my fault, through my most grievous fault.\n(303.76, 309.16)  Therefore I ask Blessed Mary of a Virgin, all the Angels and Saints, and you, my brothers\n(309.16, 313.48)  and sisters, to pray for me to the Lord our God.\n(313.48, 321.44)  May Almighty God have mercy in us, forgive us our sins, and bring us to everlasting life.\n(321.44, 323.56)  Lord have mercy.\n(323.56, 325.76)  Christ have mercy.\n(325.76, 328.24)  Lord have mercy.\n(328.24, 330.36)  Glory to God in the highest,\n(330.36, 333.28)  and on earth peace to people of good will.\n(333.28, 337.72)  We praise you, we bless you, we adore you, we glorify you.\n(337.72, 340.76)  We give you thanks for your great glory.\n(340.76, 345.16)  Lord God, heavenly King, O God, almighty Father.\n(345.16, 348.56)  Lord Jesus Christ, only begotten Son.\n(348.56, 351.76)  Lord God, Lamb of God, Son of the Father,\n(351.76, 355.56)  you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(355.56, 359.6)  You take away the sins of the world, receive our prayer.\n(359.6, 362.04)  You who are seated at the right hand of the Father,\n(362.04, 363.74)  have mercy on us.\n(363.74, 367.56)  For you alone are the Holy One, you alone are the Lord,\n(367.56, 370.68)  you alone are the Most High, Jesus Christ,\n(370.68, 374.28)  with the Holy Spirit, in the glory of God the Father.\n(374.28, 375.12)  Amen.\n(376.08, 377.04)  Let us pray.\n(378.56, 387.28)  O God, who in the glorious transfiguration of your Only Begotten Son, confirmed the mysteries\n(387.28, 393.24)  of faith by the witness of the Fathers, and wonderfully prefigured our full adoption to\n(393.24, 399.12)  sonship, grant, we pray to your servants, that listening to the voice of your beloved\n(399.12, 405.28)  Son, we may merit to become co-heirs with him, who lives and reigns with you in the\n(405.28, 425.2)  the unity of the Holy Spirit, God forever and ever.\n(425.2, 427.92)  A reading from the book of the prophet Daniel.\n(427.92, 433.36)  As I watched, thrones were set up and the ancient one took his throne.\n(433.36, 438.2)  His clothing was bright as snow and the hair on his head as white as wool.\n(438.2, 442.8)  His throne was flames of fire with wheels of burning fire.\n(442.8, 447.58)  A surging stream of fire flowed out from where he sat.\n(447.58, 453.76)  Thousands upon thousands were ministering to him and myriads upon myriads attended him.\n(453.76, 457.18)  The court was convened and the books were opened.\n(457.18, 462.76)  As the visions during the night continued, I saw one like a son of man coming on the\n(462.76, 468.84)  clouds of heaven, when he reached the ancient one and was presented before him, the one\n(468.84, 474.36)  like a son of man received dominion, glory, and kingship.\n(474.36, 479.28)  All peoples, nations, and languages serve him.\n(479.28, 483.72)  His dominion is an everlasting dominion that shall not be taken away.\n(483.72, 486.7)  His kingship shall not be destroyed.\n(486.7, 488.64)  This is the word of the Lord.\n(488.64, 490.64)  Thanks be to God.\n(490.64, 496.64)  Little Psalm, the Lord is King,\n(514.02, 519.36)  The mountains melt like wax before the Lord,\n(519.36, 521.56)  before the Lord of all the earth.\n(521.56, 524.08)  The heavens proclaim his justice\n(524.08, 526.96)  and all peoples see his glory.\n(526.96, 530.52)  The Lord is King, most high above all the earth.\n(530.52, 533.72)  Because you, O Lord, are the most high over all the earth,\n(533.72, 536.48)  exalted far above all gods.\n(537.44, 540.26)  The Lord is King, most high above all the earth.\n(541.36, 544.4)  A reading from the second letter of Saint Peter.\n(544.4, 548.64)  Beloved, we do not follow cleverly devised myths\n(548.64, 551.44)  whom we made known to you the power and coming\n(551.44, 554.28)  of our Lord Jesus Christ.\n(554.28, 558.08)  But we had been eyewitnesses of his majesty,\n(558.08, 561.04)  for he received honoring glory from God the Father\n(561.04, 564.12)  when that unique declaration came to him\n(564.12, 566.38)  from the majestic glory.\n(566.38, 571.38)  This is my son, my beloved, with whom I am well pleased.\n(571.64, 574.8)  We ourselves heard this voice come from heaven\n(574.8, 577.68)  while we were with him on the holy mountain.\n(577.68, 580.26)  Moreover, we possess the prophetic message\n(580.26, 582.66)  that is altogether reliable.\n(582.66, 584.98)  You will do well to be attentive to it\n(584.98, 587.66)  as a lamp shining in a dark place\n(587.66, 591.74)  until day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.\n(607.68, 620.76)  the Lord be with you a reading from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew Jesus\n(620.76, 625.34)  took Peter James and his brother John and led them up a high mountain by\n(625.34, 631.74)  themselves and he was transfigured to be for them his face shone like the Sun and\n(631.74, 637.94)  and his clothes became white as light. And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to\n(637.94, 644.74)  them, conversing with him. Then Peter said to Jesus in reply,\"Lord, it is good that\n(644.74, 651.3)  we are here. If you wish, I will make three tents here, one for you, one for\n(651.3, 657.98)  Moses, and one for Elijah.\" While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud\n(657.98, 664.26)  a cloud cast a shadow over them.\n(687.52, 664.26) \n(671.54, 673.68)  And this is my beloved son,\n(675.48, 675.54)  with whom I am well pleased.\n(677.58, 677.64)  Listen to him.\n(679.98, 680.04)  When the disciples heard this,\n(682.02, 682.08)  they fell prostrate and were\n(684.08, 684.16)  very much afraid.\n(686.16, 686.22)  But Jesus came and touched them,\n(687.42, 687.48)  saying,\n(690.52, 690.6)  Rise and do not be afraid.\n(692.2, 692.26)  And when the disciples raised\n(693.6, 693.66)  their eyes,\n(693.6, 699.56)  them. Do not tell the vision to anyone until the Son of Man has been raised\n(699.56, 707.52)  from the dead. The Gospel of the Lord.\n(713.0, 718.16)  Today's Feast of the Transfiguration is a very ancient feast but it became a\n(718.16, 727.14)  a universal feast in the Catholic Church in 1457 after a significant military battle outside\n(727.14, 728.8)  of Belgrade.\n(728.8, 735.5)  The Gospel of the Transfiguration is also read on the second Sunday of Lent, so the\n(735.5, 743.34)  connection between Lent and our penitential pilgrimage and also the Transfiguration and\n(743.34, 746.9)  its story of glory go hand in hand.\n(746.9, 755.7)  In fact, the date, August the 6th, was chosen specifically because it is 40 days before\n(755.7, 761.98)  the Feast of the Triumph of the Cross, which is celebrated on September 14.\n(761.98, 766.5)  So Transfiguration and Cross, they go together.\n(766.5, 772.7)  And that's emphasized by the fact that Jesus takes Peter, James, and John, the three disciples\n(772.7, 777.9)  of the Gospel today, they witness the glory of God on Mount\n(777.9, 781.66)  Tabor. His clothes become dazzlingly white and\n(781.66, 787.42)  power and glory are revealed to them and Moses and Elijah appear. Moses\n(787.42, 793.9)  represents the law, Elijah the prophets. So if you like the\n(793.9, 797.26)  expectation, the hope of the people of Israel\n(797.26, 804.06)  is fulfilled in in this event and Peter is so overwhelmed by it all that he wants to stay.\n(804.7, 812.22)  Let's build three tents, one for you, one for Elijah and one for Moses. But Jesus tells them\n(812.22, 818.14)  it's time to go down. Our lives are not spent in glory on the mountain but kind of\n(818.7, 825.9)  but in the valley as we encounter each other. So as I said Jesus took the same three apostles,\n(826.46, 825.9) \n(832.1, 837.42)  Peter, James and John on the mountaintop and also they're the same three that he brought into the Garden of Gethsemane. The three who had witnessed his glory\n(837.42, 845.3)  were also the three that Jesus chose to watch and wait with him in his suffering.\n(845.3, 851.26)  Transfiguration and Gethsemane, they go together and they reveal a profound\n(851.26, 857.26)  truth. They are two sides of the same reality and remind us of something that\n(857.26, 863.98)  ultimately we all know but sometimes we choose to deny. At the heart of life\n(863.98, 871.12)  there is suffering and transfiguration. There is pain and glory and is\n(871.12, 875.28)  particularly in the moment of transfiguration that we are strengthened\n(875.28, 883.04)  and given the courage to face the moments of pain so that we pray on this\n(883.04, 888.84)  day of transfiguration as we gather around the altar to see the Lord in\n(888.84, 894.6)  glory and receive his body and blood that we might be strengthened that our\n(894.6, 900.28)  hope might be deepened and shape be given to our love and charity and when\n(900.28, 906.8)  When we experience pain and suffering, let us know the presence and power of God, a power\n(906.8, 918.16)  that defeats death and leads to abundant life.\n(918.16, 924.36)  We make our prayer.\n(924.36, 926.4)  We pray for the Church.\n(926.4, 931.2)  all women and men who believe in Christ give witness to their faith by the way\n(931.2, 940.4)  they live. We pray to the Lord. We pray for Pope Leo. Lord give him strength, give\n(940.4, 949.56)  him courage in proclaiming your word to all. We pray to the Lord. We pray for\n(949.56, 955.96)  those who suffer, particularly those who are ill. Lord give them healing and\n(955.96, 968.6)  strength. We pray to the Lord. We pray for peace in our broken world. May those in\n(968.6, 978.48)  authority strive to bring justice to all. We pray to the Lord. We pray for our own\n(978.48, 981.52)  intentions today.\n(985.96, 990.36)  We pray for those who have asked our prayers.\n(997.24, 1004.96)  We pray to the Lord. We pray for the faithful departed. We pray for the\n(1004.96, 1012.2)  members the St. Bridget Memorial Society. Lord give them light and peace in your\n(1012.2, 1020.92)  kingdom forever we pray to the Lord show are your blessings upon us Lord God as\n(1020.92, 1025.48)  we give praise to your name we make these and all our prayers through Christ\n(1025.48, 1028.08)  our Lord\n(1042.2, 1063.2)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through your goodness we have this bread\n(1063.2, 1068.04)  to offer you, fruit of the earth and work of human hands, it will become for us the\n(1068.04, 1081.0)  bread of life.\n(1081.0, 1084.72)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through your goodness we have this wine\n(1084.72, 1090.48)  to offer, fruit of the vine and work of human hands, it will become our spiritual drink.\n(1098.04, 1114.22)  Pray, my sisters and brothers, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God the Almighty\n(1114.22, 1123.96)  Father.\n(1123.96, 1130.36)  O Lord, we pray, these offerings here made to celebrate the glorious transfiguration\n(1130.36, 1137.52)  of your Only Begotten Son, and by his radiant splendor cleanse us from the stain of sin\n(1137.52, 1145.56)  through Christ our Lord. The Lord be with you. Lift up your hearts. Let us give thanks\n(1145.56, 1152.68)  to the Lord our God. It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, always and\n(1152.68, 1158.14)  everywhere to give you thanks, Lord, Holy Father, Almighty and Eternal God, through\n(1158.14, 1165.46)  Christ our Lord. For he revealed his glory in the presence of chosen witnesses, and filled\n(1165.46, 1171.58)  with the greatest blunder, that bodily form which he shares with all humanity. That the\n(1171.58, 1176.82)  scandal of the cross might be removed from the hearts of his disciples, and that he might\n(1176.82, 1182.28)  show how in the body of the whole church is to be fulfilled, what so wonderfully\n(1182.28, 1188.28)  shone forth first in its head. And so with the powers of heaven we worship you\n(1188.28, 1194.66)  constantly on earth, and before your majesty without end we acclaim. Holy,\n(1194.66, 1201.56)  holy, holy, Lord God of hosts, heaven and earth are full of your glory, Hosanna in\n(1201.56, 1206.76)  the highest. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, Hosanna in the\n(1206.76, 1211.96)  the highest. You are indeed holy, O Lord, the fount of\n(1211.96, 1218.04)  all holiness. Make holy therefore these gifts, we pray, by sending down your Spirit upon\n(1218.04, 1224.56)  them like the dewfall, so that they may become for us the body and blood of our Lord Jesus\n(1224.56, 1232.9)  Christ. At the time he was betrayed and entered willingly into his passion, he took bread\n(1232.9, 1240.12)  and giving thanks, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, Take this, all of you,\n(1240.12, 1255.72)  and eat of it, for this is my body, which will be given up for you.\n(1255.72, 1261.64)  In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took the chalice, and once more, giving thanks,\n(1261.64, 1268.42)  He gave it to his disciples, saying, Take this, all of you, and drink from it, for this\n(1268.42, 1274.36)  is the chalice of my blood, the blood of the new and eternal covenant, which will be poured\n(1274.36, 1278.9)  out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins.\n(1278.9, 1290.84)  Do this in memory of me.\n(1290.84, 1298.24)  the mystery of faith. We proclaim your death, O Lord, and profess your resurrection until\n(1298.24, 1305.68)  you come again. Therefore, as we celebrate the memorial of his death and resurrection,\n(1305.68, 1311.38)  we offer you, Lord, the bread of life and the chalice of salvation, giving thanks that\n(1311.38, 1318.64)  you have held us worthy to be in your presence and minister to you. Humbly, we pray, that\n(1318.64, 1326.56)  partaking of the Body and Blood of Christ, we may be gathered into one by the Holy Spirit.\n(1326.56, 1332.04)  Remember Lord your Church, spread throughout the world, and bring her to the fullness of\n(1332.04, 1340.56)  charity, together with Leo our Pope, Richard our Bishop, and all who minister in your Church.\n(1340.56, 1346.46)  Remember also our brothers and sisters, who have fallen asleep in the hope of the resurrection,\n(1346.46, 1353.42)  all who have died in your mercy, welcomes them into the light of your face.\n(1353.42, 1358.62)  Have mercy on us all, we pray, that with the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God and Gate\n(1358.62, 1364.74)  of Heaven, with blessed Joseph her spouse, with the blessed Apostles, Saint Brigid, Saint\n(1364.74, 1370.9)  Augustine and all the saints, who have pleased you throughout the ages, we may merit to be\n(1370.9, 1377.7)  co-heirs to eternal life and may praise and glorify you through your Son Jesus Christ.\n(1380.82, 1384.66)  Through him and with him and in him, O God Almighty Father,\n(1385.22, 1392.58)  in the unity of the Holy Spirit all glory and honor is yours forever and ever. Amen.\n(1397.86, 1392.58) \n(1405.06, 1412.18)  At the Saviour's command and formed by divine teaching we dare to say, Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is\n(1412.18, 1413.54)  in heaven.\n(1413.54, 1419.92)  Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who\n(1419.92, 1427.02)  trespass against us, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.\n(1427.02, 1433.3)  Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil. Graciously grant peace in our days, that by\n(1433.3, 1440.78)  the help of your mercy we may be always free from sin and safe from all distress, as we\n(1440.78, 1450.22)  We await the blessed hope and the coming of our Saviour, Jesus Christ.\n(1450.22, 1456.74)  Lord Jesus Christ, who said to your Apostles, Peace I leave you, my peace I give you, look\n(1456.74, 1463.94)  not on our sins but on the faith of your Church, and graciously grant her peace and unity in\n(1463.94, 1470.66)  accordance with your will, who live and reign for ever and ever.\n(1470.66, 1484.1)  The peace of the Lord be with you always, let us offer each other the sign of peace.\n(1484.1, 1489.44)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1489.44, 1494.44)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1494.44, 1506.38)  of God you take away the sins of the world grant us peace. Behold the Lamb of\n(1506.38, 1514.0)  God. Behold him who takes away the sins of the world. Blessed are those called to\n(1514.0, 1519.34)  the supper of the Lamb. Lord I am not worthy that you should enter under my\n(1519.34, 1525.26)  roof, but only say the word and my soul shall be healed.\n(1546.46, 1525.26) \n(1547.74, 1548.74)  The body of Christ. Amen.\n(1548.74, 1549.74)  Amen.\n(1549.74, 1550.74)  Amen.\n(1550.74, 1551.74)  Amen.\n(1551.74, 1552.74)  Amen.\n(1552.74, 1553.74)  Amen.\n(1553.74, 1554.74)  Amen.\n(1732.74, 1762.5)  When Christ appears.\n(1762.5, 1770.84)  We shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.\n(1770.84, 1776.46)  Let us pray.\n(1776.46, 1782.72)  May the heavenly nourishment we have received, O Lord, we pray, transform us into the likeness\n(1782.72, 1790.58)  of your Son, whose radiant splendor you willed to make manifest in the glorious transfiguration,\n(1790.58, 1797.86)  lives and reigns forever and ever. The Lord be with you. May Almighty God bless\n(1797.86, 1805.5)  you, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Go forth proclaiming the Lord\n(1805.5, 1808.18)  with your lives.\n",

Listen to him.\n(368.0, 377.0)  Brothers and sisters, let us acknowledge our sins and so prepare ourselves to celebrate the sacred mystery.\n(388.0, 393.0)  Have mercy on us, O Lord, for we have sinned against you.\n(393.0, 398.0)  Show us, O Lord, your mercy and grant us your salvation.\n(398.0, 407.0)  May Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us our sins, and bring us to everlasting life.\n(407.0, 414.0)  Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace to people of good will.\n(414.0, 419.68)  We praise you. We bless you. We adore you. We glorify you.\n(419.68, 424.56)  We give you thanks for your great glory, Lord God, Heavenly King.\n(425.28, 430.64)  O God Almighty Father, Lord Jesus Christ, Only Begotten Son,\n(431.44, 439.68)  Lord God, Lamb of God, Son of the Father, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(440.4, 439.68) \n(446.66, 453.1)  you take away the sins of the world receive our prayer you are seated at the right hand of the Father have mercy on us for you alone are the Holy One you\n(453.1, 459.48)  alone are the Lord you alone are the Most High Jesus Christ with the Holy\n(459.48, 465.48)  Holy Spirit, in the glory of God the Father. Amen.\n(465.48, 468.48)  Let us pray.\n(468.48, 474.48)  O God, who in the glorious transfiguration of your only begotten Son,\n(474.48, 480.48)  confirmed the mysteries of faith by the witness of the Father's,\n(480.48, 485.48)  and wonderfully prefigured our full adoption to Sonship,\n(485.48, 505.48)  Grant, we pray to your servants, that, listening to the voice of your beloved Son, we may merit to become co-heirs with him who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.\n(515.48, 536.12)  A reading from the book of the prophet Daniel.\n(536.12, 544.12)  As I watched, thrones were set up, and the Ancient One took the throne.\n(544.12, 552.08)  His clothing was bright as snow and the hair on his head as white as wool.\n(552.08, 558.54)  His throne was flames of fire with wheels of burning fire.\n(558.54, 565.12)  A surging stream of fire flowed out from where he sat.\n(565.12, 574.08)  Thousands upon thousands were ministering to him and myriads upon myriads attended him.\n(574.08, 578.96)  The court was convened, and the books were opened.\n(578.96, 587.16)  As the visions during the night continued, I saw one like a Son of Man coming on the\n(587.16, 589.72)  clouds of heaven.\n(589.72, 598.52)  When he reached the Ancient One and was presented before him, the One like the Son of Man received\n(598.52, 609.36)  dominion, glory, and kingship. All peoples, nations, and languages serve him. His dominion\n(609.36, 620.84)  is an everlasting dominion that shall not be taken away. His kingship shall not be destroyed.\n(620.84, 627.84)  word of the Lord. The Lord is king, the most high over all the earth. The Lord is king,\n(632.36, 639.36)  the most high over all the earth. The Lord is king, let the earth rejoice. Let the many\n(640.08, 647.08)  lands be glad, clouds and darkness around about him. Justice and judgment are the foundation\n(649.6, 647.08) \n(651.8, 656.24)  Justice and judgment are the foundation of His throne. The Lord is King, the Most High over all the earth.\n(656.24, 663.48)  The mountains melt like wax before the Lord, before the Lord of all the earth.\n(663.48, 669.56)  The heavens proclaim His justice, and all peoples see His glory.\n(669.56, 674.36)  The Lord is King, the Most High over all the earth.\n(674.36, 682.12)  Because you, O Lord, are the Most High over all the earth, exalted far above all gods.\n(682.12, 690.16)  The Lord is King, the Most High over all the earth.\n(690.16, 694.88)  A reading from the Second Letter of St. Peter.\n(694.88, 703.14)  Beloved, we did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to you the power\n(703.14, 712.7)  and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we had been eyewitnesses of His majesty.\n(712.7, 720.26)  For He received honor and glory from God the Father, when that unique declaration came\n(720.26, 725.22)  to Him from the majestic glory.\n(725.22, 732.64)  This is my Son, my Beloved, with whom I am well pleased.\n(732.64, 741.68)  We ourselves heard this voice come from heaven while we were with him on the holy mountain.\n(741.68, 748.96)  Moreover, we possess the prophetic message that is altogether reliable.\n(748.96, 758.16)  You will do well to be attentive to it, as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until day\n(758.16, 767.28)  dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts the word of the Lord\n(788.16, 808.44)  Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia, alleluia, this is my beloved Son with whom I am, well please\n(808.44, 818.44)  Listen to him. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.\n(819.44, 827.44)  The Lord be with you. A reading from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew.\n(828.44, 837.44)  Jesus took Peter, James, and his brother John and led them up a high mountain by themselves.\n(837.44, 841.08)  and he was transfigured before them,\n(841.08, 843.72)  his face shone like the sun,\n(843.72, 848.52)  and his clothes became white as light.\n(848.52, 851.16)  And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared\n(851.16, 854.0)  to them conversing with him.\n(854.0, 856.9)  Then Peter said to Jesus in reply,\n(856.9, 861.36)  Lord, it is good that we are here.\n(861.36, 864.8)  If you wish, I will make three tents here,\n(864.8, 869.8)  one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.\n(870.66, 873.22)  While he was still speaking, behold,\n(873.22, 877.58)  a bright cloud cast a shadow over them.\n(877.58, 881.98)  Then from the cloud came a voice that said,\n(881.98, 886.98)  this is my beloved son with whom I am well pleased.\n(887.66, 890.42)  Listen to him.\n(890.42, 893.18)  When the disciples heard this,\n(893.18, 897.54)  they fell prostate and were very much afraid.\n(897.54, 899.96)  But Jesus came and touched them,\n(899.96, 903.76)  saying rise and do not be afraid.\n(903.76, 906.66)  And when the disciples raised their eyes,\n(906.66, 910.7)  they saw no one else but Jesus alone.\n(911.62, 914.36)  As they were coming down from the mountain,\n(914.36, 918.6)  Jesus charged them, do not tell the vision to anyone\n(918.6, 923.4)  until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead.\n(924.36, 926.8)  The Gospel of the Lord.\n(931.8, 934.96)  This special feast, my dear friends,\n(936.64, 941.64)  of the Transfiguration is just one of many instances\n(942.04, 944.32)  we find in Sacred Scripture.\n(946.32, 944.32) \n(957.32, 962.32)  pointing out the so unexpected activity of Jesus himself. It was a means, I'm sure, on the part of Almighty God,\n(962.32, 967.32)  in helping those apostles and others like them,\n(967.32, 971.32)  and even ourselves today,\n(971.32, 979.32)  to strengthen our faith in the presence of our loving God.\n(979.32, 989.32)  The words that were spoken to Jesus in that instance\n(989.32, 997.32)  were the words that we have here in the readings today and in the Alleluia verse.\n(997.32, 1004.32)  This is my beloved son, with whom I am well pleased, listen to him.\"\n(1006.8, 1013.8)  We don't hear God, our Father, telling us this other than what we read in sacred scripture.\n(1017.84, 1024.84)  But the message is very clear, nevertheless. Listen to him. And the question, I think,\n(1026.66, 1024.84) \n(1032.44, 1035.68)  And the question I think we need to ask ourselves is, do we listen? How attentively?\n(1035.68, 1036.68)  With what purpose?\n(1036.68, 1043.64)  Is it a case of always asking him to give us this and give us that?\n(1043.64, 1049.16)  Help us and make us holy as he was?\n(1049.16, 1054.8)  Or is it perhaps something else that we're looking for?\n(1054.8, 1062.64)  But if we don't listen to Him, if we don't focus on the fact that He is with us day in\n(1062.64, 1071.44)  and day out, here and everywhere else, every step we take, every movement we make, Jesus\n(1071.44, 1079.0)  is with us, are we listening to Him?\n(1079.0, 1082.76)  We should be.\n(1082.76, 1089.24)  We pray today for our deceased loved ones, our benefactors, our relatives and friends.\n(1089.24, 1094.0)  Those who have been good to us and good to our parish through the years, let us pray\n(1094.0, 1096.44)  to the Lord.\n(1096.44, 1102.92)  For the special intention for which this Mass is being offered today, let us pray to the\n(1102.92, 1106.24)  Lord.\n(1106.24, 1117.16)  For a sense of deeper faith and belief and trust and listening to our loving God, let\n(1117.16, 1120.32)  us pray to the Lord.\n(1120.32, 1125.2)  For all those for whom we have been asked to pray, and those who have no one else to\n(1125.2, 1131.42)  pray for them except us, let us pray to the Lord.\n(1131.42, 1137.26)  For an increase in vocations to the priesthood and religious life, particularly from among\n(1137.26, 1143.9)  the families of our own parish, let us pray to the Lord.\n(1143.9, 1152.38)  For those who have been called to the married state, the sacrament of matrimony, and those\n(1152.38, 1159.42)  others in life who are trying to find the mission that God has given to them, let us\n(1159.42, 1166.42)  pray to the Lord. For ourselves, that we may listen to the Lord attentively and prayerfully\n(1169.86, 1176.86)  and sincerely and regularly, let us pray to the Lord. For our own particular needs and\n(1180.36, 1187.36)  intentions today, let us pray to the Lord. Oh God, we ask you to hear our petitions and\n(1189.42, 1199.42)  request today and to grant them if it is your will. We ask all these things through Jesus Christ our Lord.\n(1219.42, 1249.38)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through your goodness, we have received\n(1249.38, 1252.18)  receive the bread we offer you.\n(1252.18, 1255.5)  Fruit of the earth and work of human hands,\n(1255.5, 1261.38)  it will become for us the bread of life.\n(1261.38, 1263.74)  By the mystery of this water and wine,\n(1263.74, 1273.54)  may we come to share in the divinity of Christ, who humbled\n(1273.54, 1280.54)  himself to share in our humanity? Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through\n(1290.18, 1297.18)  your goodness we have received the wine we offer you. Fruit of the vine and work of human\n(1297.18, 1302.18)  it will become our spiritual drink.\n(1305.18, 1308.18)  With humble spirit and contrite heart,\n(1308.18, 1311.18)  may we be accepted by You, O Lord,\n(1311.18, 1315.18)  and may our sacrifice in Your sight this day\n(1315.18, 1318.18)  be pleasing to You, Lord God.\n(1318.18, 1321.18)  Wash me, O Lord, from my iniquity,\n(1321.18, 1325.18)  and cleanse me from my sin.\n(1327.18, 1353.14)  Pray, brothers and sisters, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God, the Almighty\n(1353.14, 1354.14)  Father.\n(1354.14, 1357.14)  May the Lord accept the sacrifice at your hands\n(1357.14, 1362.64)  and raise your hand in the name of the Father and of the Lord.\n(1362.64, 1367.64)  Sanctify, O Lord, we pray, these offerings here made\n(1367.64, 1370.64)  to celebrate the glorious transfiguration\n(1370.64, 1376.14)  of your only begotten Son, and by his radiant splendor\n(1376.14, 1381.64)  cleanse us from the stains of sin through Christ our Lord.\n(1381.64, 1382.64)  Amen.\n(1382.64, 1393.64)  The Lord be with you, lift up your hearts, let us give thanks to the Lord our God.\n(1393.64, 1402.64)  It is right and just, it is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, always and everywhere,\n(1402.64, 1409.64)  to give you thanks, Lord, Holy Father Almighty and Eternal God, through Christ our Lord.\n(1409.64, 1416.64)  For he revealed his glory in the presence of chosen witnesses, and filled with the greatest\n(1417.64, 1424.64)  splendor that bodily form which he shares with all humanity, and the scandal of the\n(1425.64, 1431.64)  cross might be removed from the hearts of his disciples, and that he might show how\n(1431.64, 1438.64)  in the body of the whole Church is to be fulfilled what so wonderfully shone forth first in its\n(1439.64, 1454.64)  And so, with the powers of Heaven, we worship you constantly on earth, and before your majesty, without end, we acclaim Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of Hosts.\n(1454.64, 1466.64)  Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.\n(1466.64, 1473.48)  You are indeed holy, O Lord, the fount of all holiness.\n(1473.48, 1479.44)  Make holy, therefore, these gifts, we pray, by sending down your spirit upon them like\n(1479.44, 1487.64)  the dewfall, so that they may become for us the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.\n(1487.64, 1494.2)  At the time he was betrayed and entered willingly into his passion, he took bread and giving\n(1494.2, 1498.84)  But thanks broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying,\n(1498.84, 1502.64)  take this, all of you, and eat of it,\n(1502.64, 1507.64)  for this is my body, which will be given up for you.\n(1511.24, 1507.64) \n(1529.64, 1536.04)  In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took the chalice, and once more giving thanks, he gave it to his disciples, saying, Take this, all of you, and drink from it, for this\n(1536.04, 1543.04)  is the chalice of my blood, the blood of the new and eternal covenant, which will be poured\n(1544.0, 1551.0)  out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Do this in memory of me.\n(1566.04, 1573.76)  The mystery of faith.\n(1573.76, 1581.76)  We proclaim your death, O Lord, and profess your resurrection until you come again.\n(1581.76, 1588.72)  Therefore, as we celebrate the memorial of his death and resurrection, we offer you,\n(1588.72, 1595.12)  Lord, the bread of life and the chalice of salvation, giving thanks that you have held\n(1595.12, 1601.0)  us worthy to be in your presence and minister to you.\n(1601.0, 1607.72)  Humbly we pray that, partaking of the body and blood of Christ, we may be gathered into\n(1607.72, 1611.2)  one by the Holy Spirit.\n(1611.2, 1616.36)  Remember, Lord, your Church, spread throughout the world, and bring it to the fullness of\n(1616.36, 1628.32)  charity together with Leo our Pope and Richard our Bishop and all the clergy.\n(1628.32, 1633.58)  Remember also our brothers and sisters who have fallen asleep in the hope of\n(1633.58, 1641.02)  the resurrection and all who have died in your mercy. Welcome them into the\n(1641.02, 1649.98)  light of your face. Have mercy on us all we pray that with the Blessed Virgin Mary Mother of God\n(1651.26, 1661.18)  with blessed the blessed with her spouse Saint Joseph with the blessed apostles and all the saints\n(1661.74, 1669.42)  who have pleased you throughout the ages we may merit to be co-heirs to eternal life and may praise\n(1669.42, 1673.9)  and glorify you through your Son, Jesus Christ.\n(1676.06, 1682.06)  Through him and with him and in him, O God, Almighty Father,\n(1683.1, 1696.58)  in the unity of the Holy Spirit, all glory and honor is yours forever and ever. Amen.\n(1699.42, 1703.62)  At the Savior's command, informed by divine teaching,\n(1703.62, 1708.06)  we dare to say, our Father, who art in heaven,\n(1708.06, 1710.34)  hallowed be thy name.\n(1710.34, 1712.18)  Thy kingdom come.\n(1712.18, 1716.1)  Thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven.\n(1716.1, 1718.42)  Give us this day our daily bread,\n(1718.42, 1721.9)  and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive\n(1721.9, 1724.7)  those who trespass against us.\n(1724.7, 1728.58)  And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us\n(1728.58, 1735.38)  from evil deliver us Lord we pray from every evil graciously grant peace in our\n(1735.38, 1742.3)  days that by the help of your mercy we may be always free from sin and safe\n(1742.3, 1747.7)  from all the stress as we await the blessed hope and the coming of our\n(1747.7, 1757.58)  Savior Jesus Christ the kingdom devoured the glory of Lord Jesus Christ who said\n(1757.58, 1764.62)  to your apostles peace I leave you my peace I give you look not on our sins\n(1764.62, 1770.5)  but on the faith of your church and graciously grant her peace and unity in\n(1770.5, 1777.26)  accordance with your will who live and reign forever and ever the peace of the\n(1777.26, 1785.7)  Lord be with you always let us offer each other some sign of peace\n(1787.58, 1802.86)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1802.86, 1807.78)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1807.78, 1814.34)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, grant us peace.\n(1814.34, 1822.88)  As we always are, we are aware of the people who are with us through the streaming system,\n(1822.88, 1829.84)  not only locally in their homes, those who are shut in and unable to get out, the hospitals\n(1829.84, 1840.04)  and the nursing homes nearby, but all throughout the world, throughout all the distance of\n(1840.04, 1843.92)  of our country from here to the West Coast,\n(1843.92, 1847.66)  even in Europe, and in Ireland,\n(1849.1, 1851.22)  in all other parts of the world.\n(1851.22, 1854.82)  They are with us as we offer this holy sacrifice\n(1854.82, 1857.52)  of the mass through the screening system.\n(1858.44, 1861.44)  And they cannot receive Holy Communion in their homes\n(1863.4, 1865.48)  as we do here in the church.\n(1865.48, 1868.84)  And the church wants us always to keep them in mind\n(1868.84, 1873.04)  and help them to make a spiritual act of holy communion.\n(1874.44, 1878.34)  And we do that by saying together,\n(1878.34, 1881.16)  and we help ourselves as well,\n(1881.16, 1884.04)  may the receiving of your body and blood,\n(1884.04, 1889.04)  Lord Jesus Christ, not bring us to judgment and condemnation\n(1889.68, 1891.52)  but through your loving mercy,\n(1892.42, 1897.42)  be for us protection in mind and body and a healing remedy.\n(1898.84, 1907.84)  Behold the Lamb of God, behold him who takes away the sins of the world.\n(1907.84, 1911.84)  Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb.\n(1911.84, 1916.84)  Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof,\n(1916.84, 1921.84)  but only say the word and my soul shall be healed.\n(1921.84, 1925.84)  The body of Christ keep me safe for eternal life.\n(1958.84, 1986.56)  The communion verse for today.\n(1986.56, 1993.56)  When Christ appears, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is.\n(2016.56, 2041.56)  The body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body\n(2041.56, 2042.56)

celebrating Mass. It's their way of giving praise to God, I think.\n(2181.56, 2195.56)  And it certainly is commendable for the person, for the parents of those who come to mass with their little ones.\n(2195.56, 2203.56)  They should never be afraid, no matter how much noise, quote, the little one makes.\n(2203.56, 2207.96)  I think we are lucky to have the presence with us of somebody\n(2207.96, 2214.68)  whose little voice gives praise to God in his or her own way.\n(2216.88, 2219.52)  Last week, when I celebrated this mass,\n(2219.74, 2222.0)  the microphone wasn't working.\n(2223.78, 2226.78)  But before I got out of the church, actually,\n(2227.9, 2233.4)  I had a call on my phone from Ireland saying,\n(2233.56, 2242.56)  There's no mic today. I hope if they're listening today, they see that it's been corrected.\n(2242.56, 2249.56)  It's amazing when you think of it that people can be with us from so far away.\n(2249.56, 2257.56)  These particular people, this couple, were here for mass not too many weeks ago.\n(2257.56, 2263.56)  And when they knew that it was something that they could hear in Ireland,\n(2263.56, 2270.56)  I think they take advantage of their opportunity and they pray with us.\n(2270.56, 2276.56)  That's just one example of the reason we pray at Mass\n(2276.56, 2282.56)  for all those who are with us here in the Church, and you are very faithful.\n(2282.56, 2286.56)  Most of you are very familiar with the Mass each morning,\n(2286.56, 2289.64)  at least when I'm here, I notice the same people,\n(2289.64, 2294.64)  the same faces as a rule, and to think that there are others\n(2295.1, 2298.22)  around the world that we don't even know about\n(2298.22, 2300.5)  who are praying with us.\n(2300.5, 2305.38)  I think it's a great tribute to the whole system\n(2305.38, 2307.7)  that we call the streaming system,\n(2308.98, 2313.04)  and may more and more people take advantage of it.\n(2314.98, 2313.04) \n(2317.24, 2323.44)  Thank you for coming to pray with us today. I hope you have a good and a safe and a happy day, and I ask you, as I always do,\n(2323.44, 2330.28)  to please remember us, the retired priests, at Regina Cleary here in Boston.\n(2331.96, 2333.14)  Let us pray.\n(2340.38, 2333.14) \n(2348.42, 2357.94)  May the heavenly nourishment we have received, O Lord, we pray, transform us into the lightness of your Son, whose radiant splendor you will to make manifest in his glorious transfiguration,\n(2357.94, 2362.94)  who lives and reigns forever and ever, Amen.\n",

        "transcript": "(30.0, 37.0)  So, thank you very much for being with us today, and we'll see you next time.\n(237.0, 266.96)  Hail, holy Mother, who gave birth to the King, who rules Heaven and Earth for ever.\n(266.96, 272.94)  forever. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, the grace\n(272.94, 278.3)  of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with\n(278.3, 284.78)  you all. My sisters and brothers, we gather to give praise and thanks to God as today\n(284.78, 290.7)  we commemorate the feast of the dedication of the Church of St. Mary Major. Our Mass\n(290.7, 298.86)  this morning is offered for Margaret and Patrick Kennedy. I confess to Almighty\n(298.86, 303.74)  God and to you my brothers and sisters that I have greatly sinned in my\n(303.74, 308.02)  thoughts and in my words in what I have done and in what I have failed to do\n(308.02, 313.74)  through my fault through my fault through my most grievous fault therefore\n(313.74, 319.06)  I ask blessed Mary ever virgin all the angels and saints and you my brothers\n(319.06, 325.58)  sisters to pray for me to the Lord our God. May Almighty God have mercy in us,\n(325.58, 334.02)  forgive us our sins, and bring us to everlasting life. Lord have mercy. Christ\n(334.02, 341.46)  have mercy. Lord have mercy. Let us pray.\n(345.1, 341.46) \n(351.38, 358.0)  Pardon the faults of your servants, we pray, O Lord, that we who cannot please you by our own deeds may be saved through the intercession of the Mother of your Son and our Lord, who\n(358.0, 365.44)  lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.\n(381.56, 387.48)  A reading from the book of Numbers. Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses on\n(387.48, 392.28)  in the pretext of the marriage\n(392.48, 393.48)  He had contracted with a Cushite woman.\n(393.48, 394.48)  They complained,\n(394.48, 395.48)  Is this through Moses alone\n(395.48, 396.48)  that the Lord speaks?\n(396.48, 398.48)  Does he not speak through us also?\n(398.48, 400.48)  The Lord heard this.\n(400.48, 402.48)  Now Moses himself was by far\n(402.48, 404.48)  the meekest man on the earth.\n(404.48, 408.48)  And so at once the Lord said to Moses,\n(408.48, 410.48)  Aaron, and Miriam,\n(410.48, 412.48)  Come out, you three, to my meeting tent.\n(412.48, 416.48)  And the three of them went.\n(416.48, 419.48)  Then the Lord came down in the column of cloud,\n(419.48, 421.78)  and standing at the entrance of the tent,\n(421.78, 424.28)  called Aaron and Miriam.\n(424.28, 426.68)  When both came forward, he said,\n(426.68, 429.28)  Now listen to the words of the Lord.\n(429.28, 431.28)  Should there be a prophet among you,\n(431.28, 435.58)  in visions will I reveal myself to him,\n(435.58, 437.88)  in dreams will I speak to him,\n(437.88, 440.48)  not so with my servant Moses.\n(440.48, 443.18)  Throughout my house he bears my trust,\n(443.18, 445.68)  face to face I speak to him,\n(445.68, 451.42)  plainly, and not in riddles.\n(451.42, 456.02)  Why then did you not fear to speak against my servant Moses?\n(456.02, 459.42)  So angry was the Lord against them that when he departed,\n(459.42, 461.56)  and the cloud withdrew from the tent,\n(461.56, 464.9)  there was Miriam, a snow-white leper.\n(464.9, 469.34)  When Aaron turned and saw her a leper, he said to Moses,\n(469.34, 472.68)  Our Lord, please do not charge us with the sin\n(472.68, 475.08)  that we have foolishly committed.\n(475.08, 478.32)  Let her not thus be like the still newborn babe\n(478.32, 480.64)  that comes forth from its mother's womb\n(480.64, 483.28)  with his flesh half consumed.\n(483.28, 485.46)  Then Moses cried to the Lord,\n(485.46, 488.76)  please not this, pray, heal her.\n(488.76, 490.02)  The word of the Lord.\n(493.2, 495.08)  Responsorial sound.\n(495.08, 498.28)  Be merciful, O Lord, for we have sinned.\n(498.28, 501.18)  Be merciful, O Lord, for we have sinned.\n(501.18, 504.02)  Have mercy on me, O God, in your goodness,\n(504.02, 508.02)  and the greatness of your compassion, wipe out my offense.\n(508.02, 512.7)  Thoroughly wash me from my guilt, and of my sin cleanse me.\n(512.7, 515.66)  Be merciful, O Lord, for we have sinned.\n(515.66, 517.62)  For I acknowledge my offense,\n(517.62, 520.22)  and my sin is before me always.\n(520.22, 522.74)  Against you only have I sinned,\n(522.74, 525.74)  and done what is evil in your sight.\n(525.74, 528.86)  Be merciful, O Lord, for we have sinned.\n(528.86, 531.7)  That you may be justified in your sentence,\n(531.7, 533.9)  vindicated when you condemn,\n(533.9, 535.94)  Indeed, in guilt I was born,\n(535.94, 538.74)  and in sin my mother conceived me.\n(538.74, 541.86)  And merciful, O Lord, for we have sinned.\n(541.86, 544.62)  A clean heart created for me, O God,\n(544.62, 547.58)  and a steadfast spirit renewed within me.\n(547.58, 550.46)  Cast me not off from your presence,\n(550.46, 553.42)  and your Holy Spirit take naught from me.\n(553.42, 556.18)  Be merciful, O Lord, for we have sinned.\n(563.9, 583.44)  the Lord be with you a reading from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew some\n(583.44, 588.56)  Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem and said why do your disciples\n(588.56, 593.16)  break that break the tradition of the elders they do not wash their hands when\n(593.16, 599.88)  they eat a meal. He summoned the crowd and said to them here and understand it\n(599.88, 604.56)  is not what enters one's mouth that defiles the man but what comes out of\n(604.56, 609.72)  the mouth is what defiles one. Then his disciples approached him and said to him\n(609.72, 615.48)  do you know that the Pharisees took offense when they heard what you said? He\n(615.48, 620.44)  said in reply every plant that my Heavenly Father has not planted will be\n(620.44, 626.04)  uprooted. Let them alone, they are blind guides of the\n(626.04, 634.68)  blind. If a blind man leads a blind man, both fall into a pit.\" The Gospel of the\n(634.68, 646.16)  Lord. During the first three centuries of Christian faith, it was illegal to be\n(646.16, 650.88)  be Christian and so the Christians gathered not in churches to praise God\n(650.88, 655.66)  but they gathered in the homes of believers and this was particularly the\n(655.66, 661.48)  case in the city of Rome where by oftentimes wealthy people with bigger\n(661.48, 665.2)  homes would have welcomed others to their houses where they would celebrate\n(665.2, 670.24)  the Eucharist and then many of the of these people of course were persecuted\n(670.24, 677.8)  and were martyred. In the year 312, when Christianity became legal, they decided\n(677.8, 683.4)  then to build churches over the homes of the people where they used to\n(683.4, 689.56)  worship. So they would have built a church, say, over the house of St. Clement,\n(689.56, 693.92)  who we believe was the Pope at the end of the first century, or Prisca,\n(693.92, 699.76)  the house in which St. Paul stayed before he was tried and executed.\n(699.76, 706.22)  So a number of these churches were built on the site of many martyrs who had hosted the\n(706.22, 709.02)  Christian community for centuries.\n(709.02, 715.38)  But in 352, there was a proposal made to build a church in honor of Mary.\n(715.38, 721.4)  Now the Romans won't believe this, but Mary, the Blessed Mother, did not live in Rome.\n(721.4, 730.6)  So therefore, why would you build a church where the person did not host a community\n(730.6, 731.84)  in the city?\n(731.84, 740.44)  Anyway, on the night of the 5th of August 352, Pope Liberius had a dream.\n(740.44, 747.24)  And in that dream he was told to build a church in honour of Mary where he would find snow\n(747.24, 749.6)  the following day.\n(749.6, 756.96)  in Rome on the 5th of August but it was there and again Pope Liberius built a\n(756.96, 762.24)  church on that site, the site of the church Mary Majors, the church in honor\n(762.24, 767.58)  of Mary. Within the church there is a small chapel called Our Lady of the\n(767.58, 773.44)  Snows and if you were to be there for mass today they will throw white\n(773.44, 778.84)  petals from the dome of the church down on the people who gather to pray.\n(778.84, 787.12)  Mary Majors is also the church where Pope Francis chose to be buried and in\n(787.12, 794.52)  the church there is a beautiful icon of Mary called Salus Populi Romani,\n(794.52, 801.04)  the salvation of the people of Rome. And every time when Pope\n(801.04, 806.7)  Francis left Rome on an apostolic visit to other parts of Italy or different\n(806.7, 812.78)  parts of the world, he always went to that icon and prayed that Mary would\n(812.78, 819.34)  guide his journey, that her intercession would make it fruitful. And when he came\n(819.34, 825.98)  back to Rome, he went back to this icon and prayed to give thanks. So as he made\n(825.98, 832.34)  his final journey to God the Father after he died, his coffin was\n(832.34, 838.9)  brought before this icon for one last moment and now he is he's laid to rest\n(838.9, 844.94)  beside it. Anyway I'm not sure of this, I was in Rome a month ago and it certainly\n(844.94, 852.22)  was not snowing, I doubt it is today either, but let the petals fall on the\n(852.22, 857.28)  pilgrims who gather in the Church of St. Mary Majors. May there be reminded of the\n(857.28, 862.88)  the intercession of the Blessed Mother drawing us closer to her Son and\n(862.88, 872.16)  ultimately to God the Father. Mary, Mary Queen of the Universe, Queen of Rome, pray\n(872.16, 883.84)  for us on this day. We make our prayer. We pray for the whole Church that through\n(883.84, 889.96)  the intercession of Mary we all may grow closer to Jesus her son and come to know\n(889.96, 897.88)  the mercy of God the Father. We pray to the Lord. We pray for Pope Leo that the\n(897.88, 902.68)  Lord will strengthen him as he seeks to lead his pilgrim people. We pray to the\n(902.68, 909.92)  Lord. For all pilgrims, for all that the Lord will bless them in their going and\n(909.92, 920.86)  in their coming, we pray to the Lord for peace, for peace in the Promised Land, for\n(920.86, 927.8)  peace in Ukraine, Somalia, and the other troubled parts of our world, we pray to\n(927.8, 939.0)  the Lord. For those who are ill, for those who undergo surgery today, Lord be their\n(939.0, 950.92)  healing and strength we pray to the Lord for the faithful departed for Margaret\n(950.92, 957.72)  and Patrick Kennedy for whom this mass is offered gather all who have died into\n(957.72, 965.04)  the peace of your kingdom we pray to the Lord and to make these and all our\n(965.04, 971.32)  prayers through the intercession of Mary as we say. Hail Mary, full of grace, the\n(971.32, 976.24)  Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy\n(976.24, 982.32)  own Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our\n(982.32, 985.2)  death. Amen.\n(995.04, 1019.4)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through your goodness we have received\n(1019.4, 1023.48)  the bread we offer you, fruit of the earth and work of human hands.\n(1023.48, 1027.28)  will become for us the bread of life.\n(1036.92, 1040.92)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through your goodness we have this\n(1040.92, 1045.4)  wine to offer. Fruit of the vine and work of human hands, it will become our\n(1045.4, 1048.4)  spiritual drink.\n(1053.48, 1067.88)  Pray, my sisters and brothers, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God the Almighty\n(1067.88, 1079.42)  Father.\n(1079.42, 1084.94)  O Lord we ask the prayers of your people with the sacrificial offerings that\n(1084.94, 1089.5)  through the intercession of blessed Mary the mother of your son no petition may\n(1089.5, 1096.14)  go unanswered nor request be made in vain through Christ our Lord. The\n(1096.14, 1104.1)  Lord be with you. Lift up your hearts. Let us give thanks to the Lord our God. It is\n(1104.1, 1108.9)  truly right and just our duty and our salvation to praise your mighty deeds in\n(1108.9, 1114.34)  in the exaltation of all the saints, and especially as we celebrate the memory of the Blessed\n(1114.34, 1121.78)  Virgin Mary, to proclaim your kindness as we echo her thankful hymn of praise.\n(1121.78, 1128.38)  For truly, even to earth's end, you have done great things, and extended your abundant mercy\n(1128.38, 1130.62)  from age to age.\n(1130.62, 1135.42)  And when you looked on the lowliness of your handmaid, you gave us through her, the author\n(1135.42, 1142.42)  of our salvation, your Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. Through him the hosts of angels adores\n(1142.42, 1149.56)  your majesty and rejoices in your presence forever. May our voices, we pray, join with\n(1149.56, 1157.9)  theirs in one chorus of exultant praise as we acclaim. Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of\n(1157.9, 1164.42)  hosts, heaven and earth are full of your glory, Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he who\n(1164.42, 1171.98)  comes in the name of the Lord, Hosanna in the highest. You are indeed holy, O Lord,\n(1171.98, 1177.46)  the fount of all holiness. Make holy therefore these gifts, we pray, by\n(1177.46, 1182.3)  sending down your Spirit upon them like the dewfall, so that they may become for\n(1182.3, 1189.3)  us the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ. At the time he was betrayed and\n(1189.3, 1195.32)  entered willingly into his passion. He took bread, and giving thanks, broke it,\n(1195.32, 1202.84)  and gave it to his disciples, saying, Take this, all of you, and eat of it, for this\n(1202.84, 1208.4)  is my body, which will be given up for you.\n(1215.64, 1208.4) \n(1222.4, 1228.98)  In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took the chalice, and once more, giving thanks, he gave it to his disciples, saying, Take this, all of you, and drink from it. For this\n(1228.98, 1235.08)  is the chalice of my blood, the blood of the new and eternal covenant, which will be poured\n(1235.08, 1251.56)  out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Do this in memory of me.\n(1251.56, 1258.72)  The mystery of faith. We proclaim your death, O Lord, and profess your resurrection until\n(1258.72, 1264.56)  you come again. Therefore, as we celebrate the memorial of his death and\n(1264.56, 1269.04)  resurrection, we offer you, Lord, the bread of life and the chalice of\n(1269.04, 1274.88)  salvation, giving thanks that you have held us worthy to be in your presence\n(1274.88, 1280.2)  and minister to you. Humbly, we pray, that partaking of the body and blood of\n(1280.2, 1286.6)  Christ, we may be gathered into one by the Holy Spirit. Remember, Lord, your\n(1286.6, 1293.44)  Church spread throughout the world, and bring her to the fullness of charity, together with\n(1293.44, 1300.38)  Leo our Pope, Richard our Bishop, and all who minister in your Church.\n(1300.38, 1306.06)  Remember also our brothers and sisters who have fallen asleep in the hope of the Resurrection,\n(1306.06, 1309.2)  and all who have died in your mercy.\n(1309.2, 1313.12)  Welcome them into the light of your face.\n(1313.12, 1318.64)  mercy in us all, we pray, that with the blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God, with\n(1318.64, 1323.72)  blessed Joseph her spouse, with the blessed Apostles and all the Saints who\n(1323.72, 1329.56)  have pleased you throughout the ages, we may merit to be co-heirs to eternal\n(1329.56, 1337.6)  life and may praise and glorify you through your Son, Jesus Christ. Through\n(1337.6, 1342.64)  him and with him and in him, O God Almighty Father, in the unity of the\n(1342.64, 1350.6)  the Holy Spirit, all glory and honor is yours, forever and ever. Amen.\n(1351.8, 1358.12)  At the Savior's command and formed by divine teaching, we dare to say, Our\n(1358.12, 1364.88)  Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done,\n(1364.88, 1371.16)  on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our\n(1371.16, 1377.32)  trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us and lead us not into\n(1377.32, 1383.64)  temptation but deliver us from evil. Deliver us Lord we pray from every\n(1383.64, 1390.24)  evil, graciously grant peace in our days that by the help of your mercy we may be\n(1390.24, 1396.98)  always free from sin and safe from all distress as we await the blessed hope\n(1396.98, 1402.02)  and the coming of our Saviour, Jesus Christ.\n(1403.7, 1409.46)  Lord Jesus Christ who said to your apostles, peace I leave you, my peace I\n(1409.46, 1415.94)  give you, look not on our sins but on the faith of your church and graciously\n(1415.94, 1421.66)  grant her peace and unity in accordance with your will, who live and reign\n(1421.66, 1429.22)  forever and ever. The peace of the Lord be with you always and does offer each\n(1429.22, 1432.26)  other the sign of peace.\n(1436.22, 1443.22)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us. Lamb of God, you\n(1443.22, 1448.82)  take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us. Lamb of God, you take away\n(1448.82, 1453.34)  the sins of the world grant us peace.\n(1457.62, 1465.66)  Behold the Lamb of God. Behold him who takes away the sins of the world. Blessed\n(1465.66, 1470.98)  are those called to the supper of the Lamb. Lord I am not worthy that you\n(1470.98, 1478.06)  should enter under my roof but only say the word and my soul shall be healed.\n(1478.82, 1501.82)  The body of Christ.\n(1501.82, 1502.82)  Amen.\n(1592.82, 1599.82)  So, thank you very much for joining us today, and we'll see you in the next session.\n(1622.82, 1650.82)  So, thank you very much for your attention and we'll see you in the next session.\n(1680.82, 1710.5)  Blessed is the womb of the Virgin Mary, which bore the\n(1710.5, 1724.54)  Son of the Eternal Father. Let us pray as we receive this heavenly sacrament we\n(1724.54, 1730.58)  beseech O Lord your mercy that we who rejoice in commemorating the Blessed\n(1730.58, 1736.54)  Virgin Mary may by imitating her serve worthily the mystery of our redemption\n(1736.54, 1745.22)  through Christ our Lord. The Lord be with you. May Almighty God bless you, the Father,\n(1745.22, 1754.38)  the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Go forth proclaiming the Lord with your lives.\n(1796.54, 1824.54)  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n(1826.54, 1828.54)  Yeah, that was awesome.\n(1828.54, 1830.54)  Really?\n(1830.54, 1832.54)  Yeah, that was awesome.\n(1832.54, 1834.54)  Yeah, that was awesome.\n(1834.54, 1836.54)  Yeah, that was awesome.\n(1836.54, 1838.54)  Yeah, that was awesome.\n(1838.54, 1840.54)  Yeah, that was awesome.\n(1840.54, 1842.54)  Yeah, that was awesome.\n(1842.54, 1844.54)  Yeah, that was awesome.\n(1844.54, 1846.54)  Yeah, that was awesome.\n(1846.54, 1848.54)  Yeah, that was awesome.\n(1848.54, 1850.54)  Yeah, that was awesome.\n(1850.54, 1852.54)  Yeah, that was awesome.\n(1852.54, 1854.54)  Yeah, that was awesome.\n(1854.54, 1880.66)  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n(1884.54, 1898.54)  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,\n(1898.54, 1912.54)  yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,\n",

So at once the Lord said to Moses and Aaron and\n(423.66, 431.78)  Miriam, come out you three to the meeting tent and the three of them went. Then the\n(431.78, 437.74)  Lord came down in the column of cloud and standing at the entrance of the tent\n(437.74, 446.62)  called Aaron and Miriam. When both came forward he said, now listen to the words\n(446.62, 453.4)  of the Lord should there be a prophet among you in visions will I reveal\n(453.4, 461.64)  myself to him in dreams will I speak to him not so with my servant Moses\n(461.64, 470.32)  throughout my house he bears my trust face to face I speak to him plainly and\n(470.32, 480.68)  not in riddles the presence of the Lord he beholds why then did you not fear to\n(480.68, 488.3)  speak against my servant Moses so angry was the Lord against them that when he\n(488.3, 495.98)  departed and the cloud withdrew from the tent there was Miriam a snow-white leper\n(495.98, 503.12)  when Aaron turned and saw her a leper he said to Moses ah my lord please do not\n(503.12, 508.88)  charge us with the sin that we have foolishly committed let her not thus be\n(508.88, 514.44)  like the stillborn babe that comes forth from its mother's womb with its flesh\n(514.44, 525.36)  half consumed then Moses cried to the Lord please not this pray heal her\n(525.98, 527.38)  The word of the Lord.\n(527.38, 529.9)  Thanks be to God.\n(529.9, 533.02)  Be merciful, O Lord, for we have sinned.\n(533.02, 535.62)  Be merciful, O Lord, for we have sinned.\n(535.62, 538.5)  Have mercy on me, O God, in your goodness.\n(538.5, 542.3)  In the greatness of your compassion, wipe out my offense.\n(542.3, 547.66)  Thoroughly wash me from my guilt, and of my sin cleanse me.\n(547.66, 549.66)  Be merciful, O Lord, for we have sinned.\n(549.66, 554.22)  For I acknowledge my offense, and my sin is before me always.\n(554.22, 556.36)  Against you only have I sinned\n(556.36, 558.68)  and done what is evil in your sight.\n(561.84, 564.32)  That you may be justified in your sentence,\n(564.32, 566.78)  vindicate when you condemn.\n(566.78, 568.98)  Indeed, in guilt I was born,\n(568.98, 571.74)  and in sin my mother conceived me.\n(574.84, 577.56)  A clean heart create for me, O God,\n(577.56, 580.84)  and a steadfast spirit renew within me.\n(580.84, 583.5)  Cast me not off from your presence,\n(583.5, 586.24)  and your Holy Spirit take naught from me.\n(610.9, 612.14)  The Lord be with you.\n(613.1, 612.14) \n(617.42, 621.98)  The reading from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew. Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and proceeded him to the other side of the\n(621.98, 625.1)  sea while he dismissed the crowds.\n(625.1, 628.9)  After doing so, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray.\n(628.9, 631.62)  When it was evening, he was there alone.\n(631.62, 637.06)  Meanwhile, the boat, already a few miles offshore, was being tossed about by the waves, for the\n(637.06, 639.1)  wind was against him.\n(639.1, 646.26)  the fourth night of the watch, he came forward, walking on the sea. When the disciples saw\n(646.26, 648.42)  him walking on the sea, they were terrified.\n(648.42, 655.1)  It's a ghost, they said, and they cried out in fear. At once Jesus spoke to them.\n(655.1, 659.22)  Take courage. Do not be afraid.\n(659.22, 667.02)  Peter said to him in reply, Lord, is it you? Command me to come to you on the water.\n(667.02, 669.8)  He said, come.\n(669.8, 671.92)  Peter got out of the boat\n(671.92, 675.2)  and began to walk on the water towards Jesus.\n(675.2, 677.96)  But then he saw how strong the wind was\n(677.96, 679.74)  and he became frightened.\n(679.74, 683.52)  And beginning to sink, he cried out, Lord, save me!\n(683.52, 686.96)  Immediately, Jesus stretched out his hand and caught him\n(686.96, 690.76)  and said to him, oh, you of little faith.\n(690.76, 692.34)  Why did you doubt?\n(692.34, 695.44)  After they got into the boat, the wind died down\n(695.44, 698.18)  and those who were in the boat did him homage,\n(698.18, 703.18)  saying, truly, you are the son of God.\n(704.28, 706.18)  After making the crossing,\n(706.18, 708.5)  they came to land at Geneserah,\n(708.5, 711.64)  and when the men of that place recognized him,\n(711.64, 714.66)  they sent word to all the surrounding country,\n(714.66, 717.26)  people brought to him, all those who were sick,\n(717.26, 719.26)  and begged him that they might touch\n(719.26, 721.36)  only the tassel of his cloak,\n(721.36, 723.92)  as they may have touched, it was healed.\n(723.92, 725.22)  Gospel of the Lord.\n(727.78, 731.48)  Well today you saw how often they mentioned the boat,\n(731.48, 734.28)  and the boat is a sign of Peter's bark,\n(734.28, 735.92)  the ship that he's carrying.\n(735.92, 738.16)  I'm delighted there are two people from Marblehead\n(738.16, 741.04)  here today, to mask for Marblehead,\n(741.04, 745.64)  and they'll know if we're at Star of the Sea,\n(745.64, 748.16)  as you well know, right to the right is Our Lady.\n(748.16, 750.88)  Father Casey loves that statue,\n(750.88, 755.88)  And it's Mary holding the ship, our Lady Star of the Sea.\n(757.32, 760.3)  The ship is a symbol of God's fidelity.\n(760.3, 762.88)  A quick reflection today.\n(762.88, 765.92)  Today, the story of Jesus walking on water.\n(765.92, 769.24)  Water is throughout the scripture a symbol of danger.\n(769.24, 771.78)  At the very beginning, the Spirit of the Lord\n(771.78, 774.88)  hovered over the surface of the waters.\n(774.88, 779.88)  This signals God's lordship over all power and disorder.\n(780.28, 779.88) \n(784.62, 786.26)  The boat, the bock that Mary was holding in that beautiful statue,\n(786.26, 788.22)  the boat with Peter and the other disciples\n(788.22, 790.46)  is the evocative of the church.\n(790.46, 793.34)  It moves to the waters as the church will move\n(793.34, 796.42)  through time, our time, each day.\n(796.42, 801.42)  Storms may come, chaos, corruption, stupidity,\n(802.62, 807.18)  danger and persecution will inevitably rise.\n(807.18, 808.66)  Now during the fourth watch,\n(808.66, 812.26)  which is always a sign of darkness,\n(812.26, 814.12)  the darkest part of the night.\n(815.28, 817.68)  Jesus comes walking on the sea.\n(817.68, 821.0)  This is meant to be an affirmation of His divinity.\n(821.0, 824.76)  Remember they said, you must be the Christ, the Son of God.\n(824.76, 827.68)  So just as the Spirit of God hovered over the waters\n(827.68, 831.68)  at the beginning, so Jesus hovered over us this morning.\n(831.68, 835.3)  So He sees and He gives us new life.\n(835.3, 837.68)  The disciples were afraid.\n(837.68, 839.16)  He said to them, take courage.\n(839.16, 843.32)  As Jesus is saying to them every time we come to mass,\n(843.32, 845.6)  I know you thirst for my love.\n(845.6, 847.64)  Be not afraid.\n(847.64, 849.6)  I'm gonna lift you up.\n(849.6, 851.24)  Peter got out of the boat\n(858.04, 862.42)  and began to walk on the waters towards Jesus.\n(862.42, 867.32)  And this really is a story of all saints trusting in God\n(867.32, 871.12)  To conclude, the big thing that runs through the gospel,\n(871.12, 874.68)  the golden thread, is that, to Peter,\n(874.68, 878.24)  if you take your eyes off of me,\n(878.24, 880.72)  if you don't focus, he said come,\n(880.72, 882.28)  but he got distracted out of fear\n(882.28, 884.12)  and he didn't look at Jesus.\n(884.12, 886.74)  The gospel of Matthew is saying,\n(886.74, 891.74)  whenever we take our eyes off Jesus and do not trust,\n(891.74, 894.94)  we're gonna sink, but he'll raise us up.\n(894.94, 897.9)  Let us stand now for the prayer of the faithful.\n(897.9, 899.48)  Loving God, as we come before you\n(899.48, 900.86)  on this feast of Our Lady,\n(900.86, 902.98)  we ask the Lord to bless all of us,\n(902.98, 905.6)  particularly St. Mary Major, we pray to the Lord.\n(907.28, 909.38)  Pope Francis is buried at Mary Major.\n(909.38, 911.5)  I'm sure they have a feast day to day\n(911.5, 913.9)  that the Lord will be with him, we pray in eternal life,\n(913.9, 915.22)  we pray to the Lord.\n(916.28, 919.18)  For all those preparing for the wedding day to come,\n(919.18, 921.78)  that God will bless them with God's grace and love,\n(921.78, 923.08)  we pray to the Lord.\n(924.1, 923.08) \n(930.08, 932.08)  For the sick and the dying, O Lord, bless them with your grace this day, through Christ our Lord. Please be seated.\n(1013.08, 1042.4)  Pray, my brothers and sisters, that this sacrifice may be acceptable to God the Almighty Father.\n(1042.4, 1047.26)  As we honor the memory of the Mother of Your Son, we pray, O Lord, that this oblation of\n(1047.26, 1052.78)  this sacrifice may be Your grace and make it a natural offering to You through Christ\n(1052.78, 1053.78)  our Lord.\n(1053.78, 1057.1)  My friends, the Lord be with you.\n(1057.1, 1059.06)  Lift up your hearts.\n(1059.06, 1062.66)  Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.\n(1062.66, 1067.38)  It is truly right in just our duty and our salvation to praise You, mighty deeds, in\n(1067.38, 1074.1)  exaltation of your saints, especially as we celebrate the feast of our Lady Mary Major.\n(1074.1, 1079.1)  To proclaim the kindness as we echo her thanksgiving hymn of praise.\n(1079.1, 1084.78)  For truly even on earth's end you have done great things and extended your abundant mercy\n(1084.78, 1090.98)  from age to age when you looked on the lowliness of your handmaid, you gave us to her the author\n(1090.98, 1094.46)  of salvation, your Son Jesus Christ.\n(1094.46, 1096.5)  to Him and all the hosts of angels.\n(1096.5, 1098.46)  We rejoice at Your presence.\n(1098.46, 1102.38)  May our voices be one with theirs as we pray.\n(1102.38, 1106.36)  Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts,\n(1106.36, 1108.78)  heaven and earth are full of Your glory,\n(1108.78, 1110.54)  Hosanna in the highest.\n(1110.54, 1113.26)  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord,\n(1113.26, 1115.46)  Hosanna in the highest.\n(1115.46, 1118.9)  You are indeed holy, O Lord, the fount of all holiness.\n(1118.9, 1120.38)  Make holy these gifts, we pray,\n(1120.38, 1124.02)  by sending down Your Spirit upon them like the dewfall,\n(1124.02, 1129.92)  they may become for us the body and blood of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.\"\n(1129.92, 1135.34)  At the time he was betrayed and entered willingly into his passion, he took bread and giving\n(1135.34, 1140.6)  thanks, broke it, gave it to his disciples, saying,\"Take this, all of you, and eat of\n(1140.6, 1141.6)  it.\n(1141.6, 1152.58)  For this is my body, which will be given up for you.\"\n(1152.58, 1157.42)  In a similar way, when supper was ended, He took the chalice, once more giving thanks.\n(1157.42, 1162.06)  He gave it to His disciples, saying,\"Take this, all of you, and drink from it, for this\n(1162.06, 1167.26)  is the chalice of My blood, the blood of the new and eternal covenant, which will be put\n(1167.26, 1171.2)  out for you and for many, for the givest of sins.\n(1171.2, 1181.5)  Do this in memory of Me.\"\n(1181.5, 1187.26)  the mystery of faith, we proclaim your death, O Lord, and profess your resurrection until\n(1187.26, 1188.86)  you come again.\n(1188.86, 1193.82)  Therefore, as we celebrate the memorial of his death and resurrection, we offer you,\n(1193.82, 1198.34)  Lord, the bread of life and the chalice of salvation, giving thanks that you have held\n(1198.34, 1202.22)  us worthy to be in your presence and minister to you.\n(1202.22, 1208.6)  Humbly, we pray that, partaking of the body and blood of Christ, we may be gathered into\n(1208.6, 1211.48)  won by the Holy Spirit.\n(1211.48, 1214.4)  Remember, Lord, your church spread throughout the world.\n(1214.4, 1216.32)  Bring her to the fullness of charity,\n(1216.32, 1218.54)  together with Leo, your servant, our Pope,\n(1218.54, 1220.48)  our bishop, and all the clergy.\n(1220.48, 1223.88)  Let us remember the parishioners for the deceased souls\n(1223.88, 1226.0)  that we remember to this day at Mass.\n(1229.8, 1232.28)  Remember also our brothers and sisters,\n(1232.28, 1235.44)  all who have fallen asleep in the hope of the resurrection,\n(1235.44, 1237.96)  and all who have died in your mercy.\n(1237.96, 1240.8)  welcome them into the light of your face.\n(1240.8, 1243.88)  Have mercy on us all, we pray,\n(1243.88, 1246.38)  with the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God,\n(1246.38, 1249.12)  the blessed apostles, and all the saints\n(1249.12, 1250.88)  on this Feast of Mary Major,\n(1250.88, 1253.16)  who have pleased you throughout the ages,\n(1253.16, 1255.96)  that we may merit to be coheirs to eternal life,\n(1255.96, 1260.96)  and praise and glorify you through your Son, Jesus Christ.\n(1262.24, 1264.12)  Through him, with him, in him,\n(1264.12, 1266.2)  in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\n(1266.2, 1269.86)  Our glory and honor is Yours, forever and ever.\n(1269.86, 1270.7)  Amen.\n(1273.62, 1277.1)  At the Savior's command, informed by divine teaching,\n(1277.1, 1281.34)  we dare to say, our Father, who art in heaven,\n(1281.34, 1283.06)  hallowed be Thy name.\n(1283.06, 1285.82)  Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done,\n(1285.82, 1287.98)  on earth as it is in heaven.\n(1287.98, 1290.62)  Give us this day our daily bread,\n(1290.62, 1292.78)  and forgive us our trespasses,\n(1292.78, 1295.98)  as we forgive those who trespass against us,\n(1295.98, 1300.14)  and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.\n(1300.14, 1302.94)  Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil.\n(1302.94, 1305.54)  Graciously grant peace in our days,\n(1305.54, 1307.86)  that by the help of your mercy,\n(1307.86, 1312.86)  we may be always free from sin, safe from all distress,\n(1313.42, 1316.74)  as we await the blessed hope\n(1316.74, 1320.06)  and the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ.\n(1320.06, 1323.26)  For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours,\n(1323.26, 1324.78)  now and forever.\n(1324.78, 1328.12)  Lord Jesus Christ, you said to your apostles,\n(1328.12, 1332.28)  peace I leave you, my peace I give you.\n(1332.28, 1336.4)  Look not on our sins, but on the faith of your church,\n(1336.4, 1339.36)  and graciously grant her peace and unity\n(1339.36, 1341.24)  in accordance with your will,\n(1341.24, 1343.8)  who live and reign forever and ever.\n(1344.88, 1347.72)  May the peace of Christ be with all of you.\n(1347.72, 1349.92)  Let us offer each other a sign of that peace.\n(1354.78, 1361.78)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, heaven rest ye in us.\n(1361.78, 1366.78)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, heaven rest ye in us.\n(1366.78, 1376.78)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, heaven rest ye in us.\n(1376.78, 1380.78)  Behold the Lamb of God, behold him who takes away the sins of the world.\n(1380.78, 1383.78)  How blessed are we who are called to the supper of the Lamb.\n(1383.78, 1389.78)  Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof, but only say the word and my soul shall be healed.\n(1389.78, 1393.78)  May the body and blood of Christ bring us all to everlasting life.\n(1413.78, 1441.78)  If I live here, I will plant my love, Lord, I'm strong.\n(1441.78, 1470.78)  I will bring you back You will be my Lord and I will be your God\n(1470.78, 1497.78)  I will give you a new heart, a new spirit within you, for I will be your spirit.\n(1497.78, 1520.78)  In within I will plant my love, not on stone but in your heart.\n(1520.78, 1531.26)  Hark, all ye, I will bring you back.\n(1531.26, 1538.24)  You will be my Lord, and I will be your God.\n(1542.72, 1538.24) \n(1545.24, 1554.24)  and I will bring hope back. Be with me, be with you, be with me.\n(1554.24, 1563.24)  Be with me, be with you, be with me.\n(1563.24, 1589.24)  Keep living, I will find my love, not unsung but in your heart.\n(1589.24, 1600.24)  But only I will bring you back.\n(1600.24, 1607.24)  You will be my own, and I will be your love.\n(1649.24, 1651.24)  All right, we're going to go ahead and take a few minutes to\n(1678.24, 1690.76)  Let us pray.\n(1706.76, 1690.76) \n(1712.28, 1719.56)  Bless us, O Lord, this day, having been made partakers of eternal redemption, on the feast of Our Lady of the Day of God's grace, this day of Mary Major, that we, with the comments,\n(1719.56, 1723.96)  of Mary the mother of your son by the glory of his name bring us the fullness\n(1723.96, 1729.24)  of grace and experience is continued increase for our salvation through\n(1729.24, 1733.88)  Christ our Lord the Lord bless you and keep you as we bow our heads may the\n(1733.88, 1737.92)  Lord bless you and keep you may his face shine upon you and be gracious to you\n(1737.92, 1742.04)  blessing you on this feast day in the name of the Father Son and the Holy\n(1742.04, 1747.38)  Spirit amen let us join together with our lady he'll marry full of grace the\n(1747.38, 1748.94)  The Lord is with thee.\n(1748.94, 1750.84)  Blessed art thou among women,\n(1750.84, 1753.22)  and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.\n(1753.22, 1756.32)  Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for our sinners,\n(1756.32, 1758.62)  now at the hour of our death, amen.\n(1758.62, 1760.1)  Maybe today, just think of someone\n(1760.1, 1763.1)  you wanna bring to Christ, living or gone with Christ,\n(1763.1, 1765.06)  that you wanna bring to prayer this day.\n(1770.36, 1771.76)  Our celebration has ended.\n(1771.76, 1773.82)  Let us go in the peace of Christ.\n(1773.82, 1774.88)  Thanks be to God.\n(1774.88, 1775.72)  Have a great.\n",

        "transcript": "(208.0, 236.74)  Good morning, everyone.\n(236.74, 242.1)  In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, the grace of our Lord\n(242.1, 249.06)  Jesus Christ and the love of God and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with all of you.\n(249.06, 254.38)  Today we celebrate the Feast of Maximilian Kolbe, Priest and Martyr.\n(254.38, 259.54)  As we honor St. Maximilian Kolbe today, we take a moment as we ask the Lord's forgiveness\n(259.54, 266.54)  for those times that we have failed to love God or failed to love one another.\n(269.16, 276.16)  Lord have mercy. Christ have mercy. Lord have mercy.\n(277.0, 284.0)  May Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us our sins, and bring us to everlasting life.\n(284.04, 288.48)  Let us pray.\n(288.48, 295.04)  O God who filled the priest and martyr Saint Maximilian Colby with a burning love for the\n(295.04, 303.8)  Immaculate Virgin Mary and with zeal for souls and love of neighbor, graciously grant through\n(303.8, 311.16)  his intercession that striving for your glory by eagerly serving others, we may be conformed\n(311.16, 316.92)  even until death to your Son Jesus, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy\n(316.92, 339.88)  Holy Spirit, God forever and ever.\n(339.88, 343.08)  A reading from the book of Joshua.\n(343.08, 349.76)  And the Lord said to Joshua,\n(371.98, 349.76) \n(356.5, 379.02)  may know that I am with you,\n(356.5, 359.8)  carrying the Ark of the Covenant to come to a halt\n(359.8, 364.66)  in the Jordan when you reach the edge of the waters.\n(364.66, 367.8)  So Joshua said to the children of Israel,\n(367.8, 372.08)  come here and listen to the words of the Lord your God.\n(372.08, 373.2)  This is how you will know\n(373.2, 375.72)  that there is a living God in your midst,\n(375.72, 379.68)  who at your approach will possess the Canaanites.\n(379.68, 382.72)  The Ark of the Covenant of the Lord of the whole earth\n(382.72, 384.56)  will proceed you into the Jordan.\n(385.8, 384.56) \n(389.2, 393.88)  With the soles of the feet of the priest carrying the ark of the covenant, the lord of the whole earth touched the water of the Jordan and will cease to flow,\n(393.88, 397.0)  for the water flowing down from upstream\n(397.0, 402.56)  will halt in a solid bank. The people struck their tents to cross the Jordan,\n(402.56, 405.82)  with the priest carrying the ark of the covenant ahead of them.\n(405.82, 409.84)  No sooner had these priestly bearers of the ark\n(409.84, 414.14)  waded into the waters at the edge of the Jordan, which overflows\n(414.14, 419.56)  all its banks during the entire season of the harvest, then the waters flowing from\n(419.56, 426.56)  upstream halted, backing up in a solid mass for a very great distance indeed. From Adam\n(426.94, 433.62)  the city in the direction of Zerathim, while those flowing downstream towards the sea of\n(433.62, 440.62)  the Arabah, disappeared entirely. Thus the people crossed over opposite Jericho. While\n(442.22, 440.62) \n(447.66, 453.74)  While all Israel crossed over on dry ground, the priests carrying the ark of the covenant of the Lord remained motionless on dry ground in the bed of the Jordan until the whole nation\n(453.74, 456.76)  had completed passage.\n(456.76, 462.18)  The word of the Lord.\n(462.18, 465.58)  Alleluia.\n(465.58, 470.8)  When Israel came forth from Egypt, the house of Jacob from the people of Alien Tongue,\n(470.8, 476.38)  Judah became his sanctuary, Israel his domain.\n(476.38, 482.54)  The sea beheld and fled, Jordan turned back, the mountains skipped like rams, the hills\n(482.54, 486.62)  like lambs over the flock.\n(486.62, 492.0)  Why is it, O sea, that you flee, O Jordan, that you turn back, you mountains that you\n(492.0, 519.76)  You skip like rams.\n(522.0, 531.86)  reading from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew Peter approached Jesus and\n(531.86, 537.5)  asked him Lord if my brother sins against me how often must I forgive him\n(537.5, 546.46)  as many as seven times Jesus answered I say to you not seven times but seventy\n(546.46, 552.96)  seven times. That is why the kingdom of heaven may be likened to a king who\n(552.96, 558.64)  decided to settle accounts with his servants. When he began the accounting a\n(558.64, 564.58)  debtor was brought before him who owed him a huge amount. Since he had no way of\n(564.58, 571.32)  paying it back, his master ordered him to be sold along with his wife, his children,\n(571.32, 577.32)  and all his property in payment of the debt.\n(577.32, 581.32)  At that, the servant fell down, did him homage, and said,\n(581.32, 586.32)  Be patient with me, and I will pay you back in full.\n(586.32, 589.32)  Moved with compassion, the master of that servant\n(589.32, 593.32)  let him go and forgave him the loan.\n(593.32, 597.32)  When that servant had left, he found one of his fellow servants\n(597.32, 601.6)  who owed him a much smaller amount.\n(601.6, 604.58)  He seized him and started to choke him,\n(604.58, 607.78)  demanding, pay back what you owe.\n(609.24, 612.54)  Falling to his knees, his fellow servant begged him,\n(612.54, 616.76)  be patient with me and I will pay you back.\n(616.76, 618.72)  But he refused.\n(618.72, 621.84)  Instead, he had the fellow servant put in prison\n(621.84, 623.98)  until he paid back the debt.\n(625.04, 623.98) \n(630.26, 634.82)  Now, when his fellow servants saw what had happened, they were deeply disturbed, and went to their master and reported the whole affair.\n(634.82, 641.82)  His master summoned him and said to him, You wicked servant, I forgave you your entire\n(641.82, 645.7)  debt, because you begged me to.\n(645.7, 652.86)  Should you not have paid pity on your fellow servant, as I had pity on you?\n(652.86, 657.98)  When in anger, his master handed him over to the torturers until he should pay back\n(657.98, 660.52)  the whole debt.\n(660.52, 666.06)  So will my Heavenly Father do to you unless each of you forgives his brother from his\n(666.06, 668.86)  heart.\n(668.86, 675.18)  When Jesus finished these words, he left Galilee and went to the district of Judea across the\n(675.18, 676.74)  Jordan.\n(676.74, 684.98)  The Gospel of the Lord.\n(684.98, 690.4)  Today as I mentioned in the beginning of Mass, we celebrate the feast of St. Maximilian Colby.\n(690.4, 697.54)  He was a Franciscan priest whose life and death really shine as a beacon of sacrificial\n(697.54, 702.26)  love and really radical forgiveness.\n(702.26, 709.72)  It's no accident that today's Gospel speaks of unlimited forgiveness, a call to love that\n(709.72, 715.86)  knows no boundaries, a mercy that reflects the very heart of Christ.\n(715.86, 721.58)  When Peter asked Jesus if forgiving seven times was enough, he thought it was being\n(721.58, 722.58)  generous.\n(722.58, 728.08)  But Jesus replies, in effect, stop counting.\n(728.08, 730.38)  Love doesn't measure.\n(730.38, 733.06)  Mercy does not keep score.\n(733.06, 740.92)  St. Maximilian Kolbe lived this Gospel in the most radical way possible.\n(740.92, 747.3)  During World War II, he was a prisoner in Auschwitz, and he heard the plea of a man\n(747.3, 755.62)  chosen for death, a man who cried out for his wife and children.\n(755.62, 761.24)  Father Colby stepped forward and said I am a Catholic priest.\n(761.24, 764.98)  I would like to take his place.\n(764.98, 772.48)  So he entered the starvation bunker knowing what awaited him and there he comforted others.\n(772.48, 779.04)  He led prayers and turned a place of despair into a chapel of hope.\n(779.04, 786.52)  He forgave his captors, not in words alone, but by offering his life for another.\n(786.52, 793.88)  His final act was really a living homily by that priest on today's Gospel too, not forgiving\n(793.88, 800.04)  seven times, but really loving unto death.\n(800.04, 807.34)  The parable Jesus tells after his reply to Peter is about a servant forgiving a massive\n(807.34, 811.64)  debt but unwilling to forgive a small one.\n(811.64, 814.14)  And the lesson is clear.\n(814.14, 821.8)  We who have been forgiven so much by God must also forgive without limit.\n(821.8, 829.86)  We are called to do this in our daily life, in our families, our workplaces, in our communities.\n(829.86, 840.58)  There are many times that harsh words or broken promises, misunderstandings will cause issues.\n(840.58, 846.98)  But if we keep score, if we're always finding reasons to stay bitter, that's not what God\n(846.98, 849.16)  asks us to do.\n(849.16, 856.04)  If we remember how much God has pardoned us, how much God has forgiven us, we will begin\n(856.04, 862.6)  to see forgiveness, not as a favor we grant to others when we feel like it, but rather\n(862.6, 868.46)  as a duty we owe to others to love as Christ loves.\n(868.46, 875.56)  We all know that forgiveness is not easy, it's a cross for many of us, but it is the\n(875.56, 881.7)  only way to real peace in our lives, the peace that Saint Maximilian Colby carried into the\n(881.7, 888.1)  starvation bunker, the peace that Christ offers to each one of us. So we pray\n(888.1, 899.7)  today for the courage to forgive as we have been forgiven. Let us pray.\n(900.5, 906.3)  Entrusting in God's goodness, let us bring him our prayers. We pray for the\n(906.3, 912.34)  Church, the body of Christ on earth. May the Lord grant her unity and peace so\n(912.34, 919.7)  she may guide the faithful in truth and charity, we pray to the Lord. For elected\n(919.7, 928.54)  officials, may God grant them integrity and mercy, we pray to the Lord. For all\n(928.54, 934.78)  who struggle to forgive, may God heal and soften their hearts with his grace, we\n(934.78, 941.78)  pray to the Lord. For families in our community of faith, may the power of\n(941.78, 948.5)  Christ strengthen and protect them from evil, we pray to the Lord. For all the\n(948.5, 954.94)  sick that God's healing presence may be with them, we pray to the Lord. And for\n(954.94, 959.34)  all who have passed away in the light of Christ, our family, friends, and\n(959.34, 965.06)  parishioners may they rejoice forever seeing God face to face we pray to the\n(965.06, 971.34)  Lord God of mercy and goodness receive these prayers we offer you today through\n(971.34, 974.58)  Christ our Lord\n(989.34, 1008.62)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through your goodness we have received\n(1008.62, 1013.68)  the bread we offer you, fruit of the earth and work of human hands, it will become for\n(1013.68, 1018.16)  us the bread of life.\n(1018.16, 1022.16)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through your goodness we have received\n(1022.16, 1027.72)  the wine we offer you, fruit of the vine and work of human hands, it will become our spiritual\n(1027.72, 1042.84)  drink.\n(1042.84, 1048.12)  Pray brothers and sisters that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God, the almighty\n(1048.12, 1062.04)  Almighty Father, we present our oblations to you, O Lord, humbly praying that we may\n(1062.04, 1069.8)  learn from the example of St. Maximilian to offer our very lives to you through Christ\n(1069.8, 1071.36)  our Lord.\n(1071.36, 1073.88)  The Lord be with you.\n(1073.88, 1076.36)  Lift up your hearts.\n(1076.36, 1080.24)  Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.\n(1080.24, 1086.6)  It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, always and everywhere, to give\n(1086.6, 1091.64)  you thanks, Lord, Holy Father, Almighty and Eternal God.\n(1091.64, 1097.66)  For the blood of your blessed martyr, St. Maximilian Colby, poured out like Christ to\n(1097.66, 1104.24)  glorify your name, showing forth your marvelous works, by which in our weakness you perfect\n(1104.24, 1111.2)  your power, and on the feeble bestow strength to bear you witness through Christ our Lord.\n(1111.2, 1116.72)  And so with the powers of heaven we worship you constantly on earth, and before your majesty\n(1116.72, 1125.4)  without end we now acclaim, holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts, heaven and earth are full\n(1125.4, 1132.92)  of your glory, Hosanna in the highest, blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, Hosanna\n(1132.92, 1136.64)  and the highest.\n(1136.64, 1140.24)  You are indeed holy, O Lord, the fount of all holiness.\n(1140.24, 1145.6)  Make holy, therefore, these gifts, we pray, by sending down your Spirit upon them like\n(1145.6, 1152.8)  the dewfall, so that they may become for us the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.\n(1152.8, 1159.08)  At the time he was betrayed and entered willingly into his passion, he took bread and giving\n(1159.08, 1163.04)  thanks, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying,\n(1163.04, 1166.08)  take this, all of you, and eat of it.\n(1166.08, 1169.76)  For this is my body, which will be given up for you.\n(1169.76, 1181.28)  In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took the chalice,\n(1181.28, 1184.32)  and once more giving thanks, he gave it to his disciples,\n(1184.32, 1188.16)  saying, take this, all of you, and drink from it.\n(1188.16, 1190.32)  For this is the chalice of my blood,\n(1190.32, 1192.96)  the blood of the new and eternal covenant,\n(1192.96, 1195.28)  which will be poured out for you and for many\n(1195.28, 1197.56)  for the forgiveness of sins.\n(1197.56, 1199.92)  Do this in memory of me.\n(1199.92, 1204.92)  The mystery of faith.\n(1209.9, 1212.68)  We proclaim your death, O Lord,\n(1212.68, 1216.92)  and profess your resurrection until you come again.\n(1216.92, 1219.36)  Therefore, as we celebrate the memorial\n(1219.36, 1221.2)  of his death and resurrection,\n(1221.2, 1223.24)  we offer you, Lord, the bread of life\n(1223.24, 1225.72)  and the chalice of salvation,\n(1225.72, 1228.0)  giving thanks that you have held us worthy\n(1228.0, 1231.64)  to be in your presence and minister to you.\n(1231.64, 1234.48)  Humbly, we pray, that partaken of the body\n(1234.48, 1236.94)  and blood of Christ, we may be gathered\n(1236.94, 1239.7)  into one by the Holy Spirit.\n(1239.7, 1242.68)  Remember, Lord, your church spread throughout the world\n(1242.68, 1245.4)  and bring her to the fullness of charity,\n(1245.4, 1248.22)  together with Leo, our Pope, and Richard, our Bishop,\n(1248.22, 1250.4)  and all the clergy.\n(1250.4, 1252.68)  Remember also our brothers and sisters\n(1252.68, 1256.72)  who have fallen asleep in the hope of the resurrection,\n(1256.72, 1259.6)  and all who have died in your mercy.\n(1259.6, 1263.02)  Welcome them into the light of your face,\n(1263.02, 1265.32)  and have mercy on us all, we pray,\n(1265.32, 1268.6)  that with the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God,\n(1268.6, 1272.24)  Saint Joseph, her spouse, with the blessed apostles,\n(1272.24, 1276.04)  St. Maximilian Colby, St. Bridget, St. Augustine,\n(1276.04, 1280.2)  and all the saints who have pleased you throughout the ages\n(1280.2, 1283.56)  that we may merit to be co-heirs to eternal life\n(1283.56, 1285.52)  and may praise and glorify you\n(1285.52, 1288.12)  through your son, Jesus Christ.\n(1289.32, 1291.4)  Through him and with him and in him,\n(1291.4, 1294.84)  O God, almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\n(1294.84, 1298.94)  all glory and honor is yours forever and ever.\n(1302.12, 1298.94) \n(1307.24, 1311.24)  At the Savior's command and formed by divine teaching, we dare to pray now. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.\n(1311.24, 1316.84)  Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.\n(1316.84, 1323.84)  Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who\n(1323.84, 1330.28)  trespass against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil.\n(1330.28, 1336.72)  Deliver us Lord we pray from every evil graciously grant peace in our days that\n(1336.72, 1341.44)  by the help of your mercy we may be always free from sin and safe from all\n(1341.44, 1346.4)  distress as we await the blessed hope and the coming of our Savior Jesus\n(1346.4, 1353.44)  Christ, the kingdom of power and the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ, who said to your\n(1353.44, 1358.68)  apostles, peace I leave you, my peace I give you. Look not now on our sins but on\n(1358.68, 1363.64)  the faith of your church and graciously grant her peace and unity in accordance\n(1363.64, 1369.64)  with your will, who live and reign forever and ever. The peace of the Lord be with\n(1369.64, 1384.08)  you always let's offer each other some sign of Christ's peace lamb of God you\n(1384.08, 1390.04)  take away the sins of the world have mercy on us lamb of God you take away\n(1390.04, 1396.64)  the sins of the world have mercy on us lamb of God you take away the sins of\n(1396.64, 1404.16)  the world grant us peace behold the Lamb of God behold him who takes away the\n(1404.16, 1410.12)  sins of the world blessed are those called to the Supper of the Lamb Lord I\n(1410.12, 1415.0)  am not worthy that you should enter under my roof but only say the word and\n(1415.0, 1418.56)  my soul shall be healed\n(1634.64, 1645.36)  Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee, blessed art thou among women, and blessed\n(1645.36, 1648.14)  is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.\n(1648.14, 1654.88)  Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death, Amen.\n(1654.88, 1659.4)  Let us pray.\n(1659.4, 1664.6)  We pray, O Lord, that renewed by the body and blood of your Son, Jesus, we may be inflamed,\n(1664.6, 1670.52)  with the same fire of charity that Saint Maximilian Colby received from this holy\n(1670.52, 1678.08)  banquet through Christ our Lord the Lord be with you may Almighty God bless you\n(1678.08, 1684.96)  the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit our mass is ended we go in peace have a\n(1684.96, 1687.72)  great day everybody\n",

Lord have mercy. Christ have mercy. Lord have mercy. Let us pray.\n(364.74, 371.02)  O God who filled the priest and martyr Saint Maximilian Colby with a\n(371.02, 376.02)  burning love for the Immaculate Virgin Mary and with zeal for souls and love of\n(376.02, 381.1)  neighbor graciously grant through his intercession that striving for your\n(381.1, 383.82)  of glory by eagerly serving others,\n(383.82, 387.66)  we may be conformed even until death to your son,\n(387.66, 389.66)  who lives and reigns with you in the unity\n(389.66, 392.94)  of the Holy Spirit, God forever and ever.\n(404.22, 406.46)  A reading from the book of Joshua.\n(407.54, 406.46) \n(422.46, 434.46)  The Lord said to Joshua, Today I will begin to exalt you in the sight of all Israel, that they may know I am with you as I was with Moses. Now commend the priests carrying the ark of the covenant to come to a halt in the Jordan when you reach the edge of the waters.\n(434.46, 443.74)  So Joshua said to the children of Israel, Come here and listen to the words of the Lord\n(443.74, 445.7)  your God.\n(445.7, 453.36)  This is how you will know that there is a living God in your presence, who at your approach\n(453.36, 456.3)  will dispose the Canaanites.\n(456.3, 464.02)  The ark of the covenant of the Lord of the whole earth will precede you into the Jordan.\n(464.02, 471.5)  When the soles of the feet of the priests, carrying the ark of the Lord, the Lord of\n(471.5, 480.38)  the whole earth, touch the water of the Jordan, it will cease its flow, for the water flowing\n(480.38, 487.02)  down from upstream will halt in a solid bank.\n(487.02, 493.82)  The people struck their tents to cross the Jordan, with the priests carrying the ark\n(493.82, 502.7)  the covenant ahead of them. No sooner had these priestly bearers of the ark waded into the waters\n(502.7, 510.62)  at the edge of the Jordan, which overflows all its banks during the entire season of the harvest,\n(511.74, 521.5)  than the waters flowing from upstream halted, backing up in a solid mass for a very great\n(521.5, 532.22)  distance indeed from Adam, a city in the direction of Zerathim, while those flowing downstream\n(532.22, 543.02)  toward the salt sea of the Arabah disappeared entirely. Thus the people crossed over opposite\n(543.82, 543.02) \n(553.88, 563.22)  While all Israel crossed over on dry ground, the priests carrying the ark of the covenant of the Lord remained motionless on dry ground in the bed of the Jordan until the whole nation\n(563.22, 567.0)  had completed that passage.\n(567.0, 568.36)  the word of the Lord.\n(573.62, 574.12)  Alleluia.\n(576.96, 581.84)  When Israel came forth from Egypt, the house of Jacob\n(581.84, 588.0)  from a people of alien tongue, Judah became his sanctuary,\n(588.0, 590.76)  Israel his domain.\n(590.76, 592.48)  Alleluia.\n(592.48, 595.16)  The sea beheld and fled.\n(595.16, 597.52)  Jordan turned back.\n(597.52, 600.76)  The mountains skipped like rams.\n(600.76, 604.12)  The hills like the lambs of the flock.\n(604.12, 605.88)  Alleluia.\n(605.88, 609.72)  Why is it, O sea, that you flee?\n(609.72, 613.44)  O Jordan, that you turn back.\n(613.44, 617.6)  You mountains that you skip like rams.\n(617.6, 621.68)  You hills like the lambs of the flock.\n(621.68, 622.5)  Alleluia.\n(625.16, 643.22)  The Lord be with you.\n(643.22, 649.48)  A reading from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew.\n(649.48, 654.84)  Peter approached Jesus and asked him, Lord, if my brother sins against me, how often must\n(654.84, 661.32)  I forgive him as many as seven times Jesus answered I say to you not seven\n(661.32, 666.6)  times but 77 times that is why the kingdom of heaven be may be likened to a\n(666.6, 671.28)  king who decided to settle accounts with his servants when he began the\n(671.28, 676.52)  accounting a debtor was brought before him who owed him a huge amount since he\n(676.52, 681.16)  had no way of paying it back his master ordered him to be sold along with his\n(681.16, 685.68)  wife, his children, and all his property, and payment of the debt.\n(685.68, 690.8)  At that, the servant fell down, did homage, and said, Be patient with me, and I will pay\n(690.8, 692.8)  you back in full.\n(692.8, 697.86)  Moved with compassion, the master of that servant let him go and forgave him the loan.\n(697.86, 702.52)  When the servant had left, he found one of his fellow servants, who owed him a much smaller\n(702.52, 703.52)  amount.\n(703.52, 708.72)  He seized him and started to choke him, demanding, Pay back what you owe.\n(708.72, 711.32)  Falling to his knees, his fellow servant begged him,\n(711.32, 713.88)  be patient with me, and I will pay you back.\n(713.88, 715.2)  But he refused.\n(715.2, 717.64)  Instead, he had the fellow servant put in prison\n(717.64, 719.8)  until he paid back the debt.\n(719.8, 722.84)  Now when his fellow servants saw what had happened,\n(722.84, 725.72)  they were deeply disturbed and went to their master\n(725.72, 727.66)  and reported the whole affair.\n(727.66, 729.8)  His master summoned him and said to him,\n(729.8, 733.18)  you wicked servant, I forgave you your entire debt\n(733.18, 734.98)  because you begged me to.\n(734.98, 737.56)  Should you not have had pity on your fellow servant\n(737.56, 739.64)  as I had had pity on you.\n(739.64, 742.96)  Then in anger, his master handed him over to the torturers\n(742.96, 746.04)  until he should pay back the full debt.\n(746.04, 748.56)  So will my heavenly father do to you,\n(748.56, 752.26)  unless each of you forgives his brother from his heart.\n(752.26, 754.2)  When Jesus finished these words,\n(754.2, 757.52)  he left Galilee and went to the district of Judea\n(757.52, 760.5)  across the Jordan, the gospel of the Lord.\n(765.6, 760.5) \n(772.9, 778.3)  It's impossible to appreciate the gift of Jesus without understanding the Old Testament. And for the past few weeks this summer, we've been journeying with the people of Israel\n(778.3, 781.94)  through the desert on their quest to get to the promised land.\n(781.94, 786.34)  And just a very helpful point from today's reading, I think, unlocks a very important\n(786.34, 788.58)  key in the spiritual life.\n(788.58, 795.32)  So we see in the book of Joshua that Joshua is charged with leading the people of Israel\n(795.32, 797.12)  into the promised land.\n(797.12, 802.68)  Moses got them to the very edge, but then he passed and he saw the promised land from\n(802.68, 808.64)  afar, but he never got to lead the people there, and so this task is Joshua's.\n(808.64, 814.2)  And so we see that for them to get to the promised land, the Israelites are going to\n(814.2, 815.9)  need to do battle.\n(815.9, 819.02)  they're going to need to engage with the Canaanites\n(819.02, 820.98)  and the different tribes.\n(820.98, 824.58)  And so the first test that Joshua has\n(824.58, 827.7)  is to lead the people across the Jordan.\n(827.7, 830.82)  And what leads them is the Ark of the Covenant.\n(830.82, 832.42)  And the Ark of the Covenant was\n(832.42, 834.88)  what carried the presence of God.\n(834.88, 836.18)  And why is this important?\n(836.18, 839.18)  Well, throughout this book, you're going to see\n(839.18, 842.86)  when the Israelites put God first\n(842.86, 845.1)  and he leads them into battle,\n(845.1, 847.36)  They're always delivered.\n(847.36, 849.48)  What's the lesson for us?\n(849.48, 851.28)  The Ark of the Covenant,\n(851.28, 854.36)  which carried the presence of God,\n(854.36, 857.6)  the true Ark of the Covenant is Mary.\n(857.6, 859.24)  Actually, that's what the whole feast\n(859.24, 860.68)  of the Assumption is all about,\n(860.68, 862.64)  which we celebrate tomorrow.\n(862.64, 865.44)  So Mary is the Ark of the Covenant.\n(865.44, 869.9)  All of us are also on our journey to the Promised Land.\n(869.9, 872.56)  We're not there yet, we're traveling,\n(872.56, 875.68)  and we engage in many spiritual battles,\n(875.68, 879.28)  many temptations, many struggles, many doubts.\n(879.28, 882.86)  We need to be led by the Ark of the Covenant,\n(882.86, 886.2)  which is Mary who carries the presence of God.\n(886.2, 890.72)  If we let Mary lead, we will be delivered.\n(890.72, 893.68)  The saint we honor today, Saint Maximilian Kolbe,\n(893.68, 897.52)  who died in Auschwitz, understood this very well.\n(897.52, 901.8)  In fact, he created the militia of the Immaculata\n(901.8, 905.44)  That was his main apostolate for the zeal of souls.\n(905.44, 907.2)  He traveled all the way to Japan.\n(907.2, 911.2)  He was born in Poland, promoting the devotion to Mary\n(911.2, 914.92)  under the title of this Ark of the Covenant.\n(914.92, 918.64)  He had a great devotion to Mary because he understood\n(918.64, 921.0)  that her job was to deliver us\n(921.0, 923.88)  from these spiritual battles we face.\n(923.88, 927.44)  And so it was actually prayers to Mary\n(927.44, 930.52)  that allowed Maximilian Kolbe when he was placed\n(930.52, 934.32)  and the starvation chamber to pray with all of those\n(934.32, 937.24)  who were in the most horrific conditions.\n(937.24, 939.16)  And he would not die.\n(939.16, 942.98)  And in fact, he needed to be injected with poison\n(942.98, 944.84)  because he was not dying.\n(944.84, 948.5)  And he was giving so many of the prisoners hope\n(948.5, 950.82)  through his prayers to Mary.\n(950.82, 953.12)  What a sign it is that the Ark of the Covenant\n(953.12, 956.14)  can lead us even in the darkest of times.\n(956.14, 959.32)  We would do well, as Maximilian Colby did,\n(959.32, 962.4)  to turn to her and ask for her guidance\n(962.4, 965.48)  so we too can be delivered to the promised land.\n(965.48, 968.04)  And so let us stand and make our petitions\n(968.04, 969.78)  known to our Heavenly Father.\n(971.44, 974.52)  We pray for Pope Leo and for Bishop Richard Henning\n(974.52, 976.88)  and for all bishops throughout the church.\n(976.88, 980.16)  May God give them the grace to be true shepherds of souls\n(980.16, 982.52)  so all can come to know the love of Christ.\n(982.52, 983.84)  We pray to the Lord.\n(985.66, 987.48)  We pray for all civil leaders, governments,\n(987.48, 989.28)  and elected officials throughout the world.\n(989.28, 991.92)  May they enact policies that protect the church\n(991.92, 994.0)  and give her the freedom to be herself\n(994.0, 995.68)  so the kingdom of God can be spread\n(995.68, 997.0)  to every corner of the globe.\n(997.0, 998.3)  We pray to the Lord.\n(999.34, 1001.28)  We pray for an increase of vocations\n(1001.28, 1003.36)  to the priesthood and to the religious life,\n(1003.36, 1005.44)  especially for members from our own parishes\n(1005.44, 1006.76)  and our own families.\n(1006.76, 1009.52)  May the heroic witness of Maximilian Colby\n(1009.52, 1012.88)  call many men and women to give their lives entirely to God.\n(1012.88, 1014.06)  We pray to the Lord.\n(1015.32, 1016.8)  And we pray for our parishioners\n(1016.8, 1018.52)  for whom this mass is offered.\n(1018.52, 1021.06)  Through the mercy of God and with the help of our prayers,\n(1021.06, 1023.4)  may they come to see Christ face to face.\n(1023.4, 1024.64)  We pray to the Lord.\n(1025.94, 1028.96)  Heavenly Father, we make these prayers with great confidence\n(1028.96, 1030.52)  as we ask them through the intercession\n(1030.52, 1033.0)  of Saint Maximilian Colby and Mary,\n(1033.0, 1035.1)  our morning star and gate of heaven,\n(1035.1, 1037.72)  and we speak them in the name of Jesus, her son,\n(1037.72, 1039.84)  who is Lord forever and ever.\n(1039.84, 1040.66)  Amen.\n(1108.52, 1134.2)  Pray, brothers and sisters, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God, the Almighty\n(1134.2, 1135.2)  Father.\n(1135.2, 1148.48)  We present our oblations to you, O Lord, humbly praying that we may learn from the example\n(1148.48, 1155.9)  of Saint Maximilian Colby to offer our very lives to you through Christ our Lord.\n(1155.9, 1158.42)  The Lord be with you.\n(1158.42, 1161.08)  Lift up your hearts.\n(1161.08, 1165.18)  Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.\n(1165.18, 1168.38)  It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,\n(1168.38, 1170.62)  always and everywhere to give you thanks,\n(1170.62, 1173.26)  Lord, Holy Father, Almighty and Eternal God,\n(1173.26, 1176.54)  for the blood of your blessed martyr, Maximilian Kolbe,\n(1176.54, 1179.22)  poured out like Christ to glorify your name,\n(1179.22, 1181.38)  shows forth your marvelous works,\n(1181.38, 1184.2)  by which in our weakness you perfect your power,\n(1184.2, 1186.9)  and on the feeble bestow strength to bear you witness\n(1186.9, 1188.44)  through Christ our Lord.\n(1188.44, 1190.36)  And so with the powers of heaven,\n(1190.36, 1192.58)  we worship you constantly on earth,\n(1192.58, 1194.66)  and before your majesty without end,\n(1194.66, 1196.06)  Be a clay.\n(1196.06, 1200.26)  Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts,\n(1200.26, 1202.82)  heaven and earth are full of your glory.\n(1202.82, 1204.9)  Hosanna in the highest.\n(1204.9, 1208.14)  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.\n(1208.14, 1209.94)  Hosanna in the highest.\n(1213.22, 1215.1)  You are indeed holy, O Lord,\n(1215.1, 1217.98)  and all you have created rightly gives you praise.\n(1217.98, 1220.78)  For through your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ,\n(1220.78, 1223.34)  by the power and working of the Holy Spirit,\n(1223.34, 1226.16)  you give life to all things and make them holy,\n(1226.16, 1228.98)  and you never cease to gather a people to yourself,\n(1228.98, 1231.72)  so that from the rising of the sun to its setting,\n(1231.72, 1235.12)  a pure sacrifice may be offered to your name.\n(1235.12, 1238.0)  Therefore, O Lord, we humbly implore you,\n(1238.0, 1240.96)  by the same Spirit graciously make holy these gifts\n(1240.96, 1243.2)  we have brought to you for consecration,\n(1243.2, 1246.24)  that they may become the body and blood\n(1246.24, 1249.08)  of your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ,\n(1249.08, 1252.2)  at whose command we celebrate these mysteries.\n(1252.2, 1254.92)  For on the night he was betrayed,\n(1254.92, 1258.0)  he himself took bread, and giving you thanks,\n(1258.0, 1260.54)  he said the blessing, broke the bread,\n(1260.54, 1263.16)  and gave it to his disciples, saying,\n(1264.24, 1268.88)  Take this, all of you, and eat of it,\n(1268.88, 1273.88)  for this is my body, which will be given up for you.\n(1277.32, 1273.88) \n(1294.64, 1299.8)  In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took the chalice, and giving you thanks, he said the blessing, and gave the chalice to his disciples, saying,\n(1299.8, 1308.54)  Take this, all of you, and drink from it, for this is the chalice of my blood, the\n(1308.54, 1313.34)  blood of the new and eternal covenant, which will be poured out for you and for\n(1313.34, 1320.4)  many for the forgiveness of sins. Do this in memory of me.\n(1329.8, 1341.08)  The mystery of faith, save us, Savior of the world, for by your cross and resurrection\n(1341.08, 1342.96)  you have set us free.\n(1342.96, 1348.2)  Therefore, O Lord, as we celebrate the memorial of the saving passion of your Son, his wondrous\n(1348.2, 1352.8)  resurrection and ascension into heaven, and as we look forward to his second coming, we\n(1352.8, 1356.16)  offer you in thanksgiving this holy and living sacrifice.\n(1356.16, 1361.44)  we pray upon the oblation of your Church, and recognizing the sacrificial victim by whose death\n(1361.44, 1366.88)  you willed to reconcile us to yourself, grant that we who are nourished by the body and blood of your\n(1366.88, 1373.2)  son and filled with his Holy Spirit may become one body, one spirit in Christ. May he make of us an\n(1373.2, 1378.24)  eternal offering to you, so that we may obtain an inheritance with your elect, especially with the\n(1378.24, 1383.52)  most blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God, with blessed Joseph, her spouse, with your blessed\n(1383.52, 1385.52)  of the apostles and glorious martyrs,\n(1385.52, 1389.02)  with Saint Maximilian Colby, and with all the saints,\n(1389.02, 1391.44)  under constant intercession in your presence,\n(1391.44, 1393.54)  we rely for unfailing help.\n(1393.54, 1397.12)  May this sacrifice of our reconciliation, we pray over,\n(1397.12, 1400.08)  advance the peace and salvation of all the world.\n(1400.08, 1402.12)  Be pleased to confirm in faith and charity\n(1402.12, 1403.64)  your pilgrim church on earth,\n(1403.64, 1407.24)  with your servant Leo, our pope, and Richard, our bishop,\n(1407.24, 1409.5)  the order of bishops, all the clergy,\n(1409.5, 1412.64)  and the entire people you have gained for your own.\n(1412.64, 1415.84)  listen graciously to the prayers of this family,\n(1415.84, 1417.68)  whom you have summoned before you.\n(1417.68, 1420.04)  In your compassion, O merciful Father,\n(1420.04, 1421.84)  gather to yourself all your children\n(1421.84, 1423.5)  scattered throughout the world.\n(1423.5, 1425.76)  To our departed brothers and sisters,\n(1425.76, 1427.08)  and to all who are pleasing to you\n(1427.08, 1429.04)  at their passing from this life,\n(1429.04, 1431.04)  give kind admissions to your kingdom.\n(1431.04, 1434.04)  Here we hope to enjoy forever the fullness of your glory,\n(1434.04, 1435.48)  through Christ our Lord,\n(1435.48, 1438.34)  through whom you bestow on the world all that is good.\n(1442.46, 1438.34) \n(1447.62, 1454.1)  Through him, and with him, and in him, O God, Almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, all glory and honor is yours, forever and ever.\n(1454.1, 1461.34)  At the Saviour's command, informed by divine teaching, we dare to say, Our Father, who\n(1461.34, 1467.82)  art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is\n(1467.82, 1475.1)  in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who\n(1475.1, 1482.7)  trespass against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil deliver us lord we pray\n(1482.7, 1488.62)  from every evil graciously grant peace in our days that by the help of your mercy we may be always\n(1488.62, 1494.7)  free from sin and safe from all distress as we await the blessed hope and the coming of our savior\n(1494.7, 1503.82)  Jesus Christ Lord Jesus Christ who said to your apostles peace I leave you my\n(1503.82, 1507.78)  peace I give you look not in our sins but on the faith of your church and\n(1507.78, 1511.98)  graciously grant your peace and unity in accordance with your will who live and\n(1511.98, 1517.5)  reign forever and ever the peace of the Lord be with you always let us offer\n(1517.5, 1519.24)  for each other the sign of peace.\n(1522.46, 1526.24)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world,\n(1526.24, 1527.98)  have mercy on us.\n(1527.98, 1531.22)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world,\n(1531.22, 1532.9)  have mercy on us.\n(1532.9, 1536.24)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world,\n(1536.24, 1537.56)  grant us peace.\n(1547.5, 1559.46)  Behold the Lamb of God, behold Him who takes away the sins of the world.\n(1559.46, 1561.94)  Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb.\n(1561.94, 1567.42)  Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof, but only say the word and my\n(1567.42, 1574.42)  my soul shall be healed.\n(1597.42, 1622.42)  Greater love has no one than to lay down his life for his friends, says the Lord.\n(1830.42, 1840.1)  let us pray we pray o Lord that renewed by the body and blood of your son we may\n(1840.1, 1844.86)  be inflamed with the same fire of charity that st.

        "transcript": "(150.0, 152.0)  Thank you so much for joining us, and we'll see you next time.\n(239.0, 255.64)  Good morning, everyone.\n(255.64, 261.6)  In your prayers today, we'd ask you to remember Jenna Fitzgerald, for whom this Mass is offered.\n(261.6, 266.72)  In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, the grace of our Lord\n(266.72, 273.4)  Jesus Christ and the love of God and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with all of you.\n(273.4, 279.4)  As we prepare to celebrate this Eucharist today, we take a moment before we begin, asking\n(279.4, 285.36)  the Lord's forgiveness for our sins.\n(285.36, 292.84)  Lord have mercy, Christ have mercy, Lord have mercy.\n(292.84, 299.76)  May Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us our sins, and bring us to everlasting life.\n(299.76, 303.4)  Let us pray.\n(303.4, 309.92)  Almighty ever-living God, whom taught by the Holy Spirit we dare to call our Father, bring\n(309.92, 316.8)  we pray to perfection in our hearts the spirit of adoption as your sons and daughters, that\n(316.8, 322.16)  we may merit to enter into the inheritance which you have promised, through our Lord\n(322.16, 326.0)  Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy\n(326.0, 330.56)  Spirit, God forever and ever.\n(346.44, 330.56) \n(350.6, 356.84)  A reading from the book of Numbers. The whole congregation of the children of Israel arrived in the desert of Zin in the\n(356.84, 363.92)  first month, and the people settled in Kadesh. It was here that Miriam died and\n(363.92, 370.5)  here that she was buried. As the community had no water, they held a\n(370.5, 376.94)  council against Moses and Aaron. The people contended with Moses, exclaiming,\n(376.94, 383.62)  would that we too had perished with our kinsmen in the Lord's presence. Why have\n(383.62, 387.42)  have you brought the Lord's\n(387.42, 390.46)  assembly into this desert,\n(390.46, 391.46)  where we and our livestock\n(391.46, 393.46)  are dying?\n(393.46, 395.46)  Why did you lead us out of\n(395.46, 396.46)  Egypt, only to bring us to\n(396.46, 398.46)  this wretched place, which\n(398.46, 400.46)  has neither grain, nor figs,\n(400.46, 403.46)  nor vines, nor pomegranates?\n(403.46, 404.46)  Here there is not even\n(404.46, 407.46)  water to drink.\n(407.46, 409.46)  But Moses and Aaron went away\n(409.46, 410.46)  from the assembly to the\n(410.46, 412.46)  entrance of the meeting tent,\n(412.46, 413.46)  where they fell prostrate.\n(413.46, 418.82)  Lord appeared to them and the Lord said to Moses take your staff and assemble\n(418.82, 424.74)  the community you and your brother Aaron and in their presence out of the rock to\n(424.74, 430.06)  yield its waters from the rock you shall bring forth water for the congregation\n(430.06, 436.18)  and their livestock to drink so Moses took his staff from its place before the\n(436.18, 441.36)  Lord as he was ordered he and Aaron assembled the community in front of the\n(441.36, 448.28)  rock where he said to them, listen to me you rebels, are we to bring water for you\n(448.28, 454.22)  out of this rock? Then raising his hand Moses struck the rock twice with his\n(454.22, 458.92)  staff and water gushed out in abundance for the people in their livestock to\n(458.92, 464.6)  drink. But the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, because you were not faithful to\n(464.6, 469.92)  me and showing forth my sanctity before the children of Israel, you shall not\n(469.92, 475.12)  lead this community into the land I will give them. These are the waters of\n(475.12, 480.56)  Meribah, where the children of Israel contended against the Lord, and where the\n(480.56, 490.32)  Lord revealed his sanctity among them. The word of the Lord. If today you hear\n(490.32, 499.88)  his voice, pardon not your hearts. Come let us sing joyfully to the Lord, let us\n(499.88, 504.12)  Let us acclaim the rock\n(511.26, 513.26)  of our salvation.\n(513.26, 514.26)  Let us come into his presence\n(514.26, 516.26)  with thanksgiving.\n(516.26, 517.26)  Let us joyfully sing\n(517.26, 518.26)  psalms to him.\n(518.26, 519.26)  Come, let us bow down\n(519.26, 520.26)  and worship.\n(520.26, 521.26)  Let us kneel before the\n(521.26, 522.26)  Lord who made us.\n(522.26, 523.26)  For he is our God,\n(523.26, 524.26)  and we are the people\n(524.26, 525.26)  he shepherds,\n(525.26, 529.26)  the flock he guides.\n(529.26, 531.58)  that today you would hear his voice,\n(531.58, 534.76)  harden not your hearts as at Meribah\n(534.76, 537.32)  in the day of Massa in the desert,\n(537.32, 539.72)  where your fathers tested me.\n(539.72, 543.1)  They tested me even though they had seen my works.\n(559.26, 579.34)  the Lord be with you a reading from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew Jesus\n(579.34, 584.46)  went into the region of Caesarea Philippi and he asked his disciples who\n(584.46, 588.82)  Who do people say that the Son of Man is?\n(588.82, 594.74)  They replied, Some say John the Baptist, others Elijah, and still others Jeremiah are one\n(594.74, 596.96)  of the prophets.\n(596.96, 601.84)  He said to them, But who do you say that I am?\n(601.84, 608.62)  Simon Peter said in reply, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.\n(608.62, 610.94)  Jesus said to him in reply,\n(610.94, 614.18)  blessed are you Simon, son of Jonah,\n(614.18, 617.1)  for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you,\n(617.1, 619.58)  but my heavenly father.\n(619.58, 623.7)  And so I say to you, you are Peter,\n(623.7, 627.06)  and upon this rock I will build my church,\n(627.06, 628.68)  and the gates of the netherworld\n(628.68, 631.34)  shall not prevail against it.\n(631.34, 634.74)  I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven.\n(634.74, 638.18)  Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven,\n(638.18, 642.52)  and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\"\n(642.52, 645.38)  Then he strictly ordered his disciples\n(645.38, 649.68)  to tell no one that he was the Christ.\n(649.68, 654.04)  From that time on, Jesus began to show his disciples\n(654.04, 658.4)  that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer greatly\n(658.4, 662.04)  from the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes,\n(662.04, 667.02)  and be killed, and on the third day be raised.\n(667.02, 671.62)  Then Peter took Jesus aside and began to rebuke him.\n(671.62, 676.14)  God forbid, Lord, no such thing shall ever happen to you.\n(677.16, 681.9)  He turned and said to Peter, get behind me, Satan.\n(681.9, 684.94)  You are an obstacle to me.\n(684.94, 689.82)  You are thinking not as God does, but as human beings do.\n(691.22, 693.62)  The gospel of the Lord.\n(693.62, 705.38)  In today's Gospel we witness that dramatic moment in Peter's journey of\n(705.38, 711.8)  faith. First he makes a bold and beautiful confession to the Lord, you are\n(711.8, 718.76)  the Christ, the Son of the living God. And for this Jesus praises him and calls him\n(718.76, 724.1)  blessed, recognizing that this truth was revealed to Peter not by flesh and blood\n(724.1, 730.16)  as he said, but by the Father in heaven. But then we see moments later Peter\n(730.16, 736.4)  stumbles when Jesus begins to speak about his coming suffering and death.\n(736.4, 745.04)  Peter protests, God forbid Lord, this shall never happen to you. And now Jesus\n(745.04, 754.54)  rebukes him sharply, get behind me Satan. This shift reminds us of how quickly our\n(754.54, 762.26)  human thinking can get in the way of God's plan. Peter out of love and fear\n(762.26, 768.48)  wants to protect Jesus from the cross but in doing so he unknowingly tries to\n(768.48, 776.6)  stand in the way of that moment of salvation itself. Jesus calls us not only\n(776.6, 783.48)  to recognize who he is but also to follow him even when the path leads to\n(783.48, 789.68)  the cross. True discipleship means surrendering our own\n(789.68, 794.92)  expectations and trusting in the wisdom of God even when it's difficult to\n(794.92, 803.24)  understand. So maybe today we can ask the Lord for two graces, the courage to\n(803.24, 810.16)  proclaim him as the Christ, the Lord of our lives, and then ask for the grace of\n(810.16, 817.08)  humility to follow him, even when the road leads through suffering or through\n(817.08, 824.0)  uncertainty in our lives, always knowing that the resurrection new life always\n(824.0, 834.4)  follows those uncertainties or sufferings that we all experience. Let us\n(834.4, 843.76)  pray. And with trust in the Lord and in his plan for us, we offer him our\n(843.76, 848.84)  petitions and we pray for the church. May God bless her with more holy men and\n(848.84, 858.16)  women to serve God and his people in the priesthood and religious life, we pray to the Lord.\n(858.16, 864.08)  For all leaders of the world, may the Lord inspire them to secure peace and unity for\n(864.08, 866.08)  their people.\n(866.08, 871.2)  Especially we pray today for the leaders that are now engaging in war with the innocent\n(871.2, 876.14)  and vulnerable, we pray to the Lord.\n(876.14, 882.1)  For those burdened by sickness for their caretakers, and may Jesus grant them strength, hope and\n(882.1, 886.22)  patience, we pray to the Lord.\n(886.22, 891.06)  For all in our Mass this morning that are struggling with doubts in their faith, may\n(891.06, 898.16)  Jesus the Good Shepherd embrace them in his loving arms, we pray to the Lord.\n(898.16, 902.86)  For those who have died in faith, and today we remember Jenna Fitzgerald for whom this\n(902.86, 904.7)  Mass is offered.\n(904.7, 913.18)  May they experience eternal salvation and God's merciful care, we pray to the Lord.\n(913.18, 916.98)  Lord God, please hear and answer these prayers according to your will.\n(916.98, 919.5)  We ask them through Christ our Lord.\n(934.7, 956.02)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through your goodness we have received\n(956.02, 960.14)  the bread we offer you, fruit of the earth and work of human hands.\n(960.14, 965.26)  It will become for us the bread of life.\n(965.26, 969.5)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through your goodness we have received\n(969.5, 971.54)  the wine we offer you.\n(971.54, 975.74)  Fruit of the vine and work of human hands, it will become our spiritual drink.\n(990.14, 997.14)  Pray, brothers and sisters, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God, the almighty Father.\n(1006.14, 1013.14)  Be pleased, O Lord, to accept the offerings of your Church, for in your mercy you have given them to be offered,\n(1013.14, 1019.14)  and by your power you transform them into the mystery of our salvation, through Christ our Lord.\n(1019.14, 1028.94)  The Lord be with you. Lift up your hearts. Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.\n(1028.94, 1034.54)  It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, always and everywhere, to\n(1034.54, 1040.46)  give you thanks, Lord, Holy Father, Almighty and Eternal God. For just as\n(1040.46, 1045.72)  through your beloved Son you created the human race, so also through Him with\n(1045.72, 1050.46)  great goodness you formed it anew. And so it is right that all your creatures\n(1050.46, 1055.58)  serve you, all the redeemed praise you, and all your saints with one heart bless\n(1055.58, 1061.98)  you. Therefore we too extol you with all the angels as in joyful celebration we\n(1061.98, 1069.82)  now acclaim. Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts, heaven and earth are full of your\n(1069.82, 1075.26)  glory, Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord,\n(1075.26, 1080.88)  Lord, Hosanna in the highest.\n(1080.88, 1084.48)  You are indeed holy, O Lord, the fount of all holiness.\n(1084.48, 1089.24)  Make holy, therefore, these gifts, we pray, by sending down your Spirit upon them like\n(1089.24, 1096.26)  the dewfall, so that they may become for us the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.\n(1096.26, 1102.2)  At the time he was betrayed and entered willingly into his passion, he took bread and, giving\n(1102.2, 1107.58)  thanks broke it and gave it to his disciples saying take this all of you\n(1107.58, 1114.32)  and eat of it. For this is my body which will be given up for you.\n(1120.52, 1125.72)  In a similar way when supper was ended he took the chalice and once more giving\n(1125.72, 1130.96)  thanks he gave it to his disciples saying take this all of you and drink\n(1130.96, 1135.48)  from it, for this is the chalice of my blood, the blood of the new and eternal\n(1135.48, 1140.24)  covenant, which will be poured out for you and for many for the forgiveness of\n(1140.24, 1145.4)  sins. Do this in memory of me.\"\n(1152.48, 1159.32)  The mystery of faith. We proclaim your death, O Lord, and profess your\n(1159.32, 1165.2)  resurrection until you come again. Therefore as we celebrate the memorial\n(1165.2, 1169.08)  of his death and resurrection we offer you Lord the bread of life and the\n(1169.08, 1174.2)  chalice of salvation giving thanks that you have held us worthy to be in your\n(1174.2, 1179.92)  presence and minister to you. Humbly we pray that partaking of the body and\n(1179.92, 1185.64)  blood of Christ we may be gathered into one by the Holy Spirit. Remember Lord\n(1185.64, 1191.4)  your Church spread throughout the world and bring her to the fullness of charity together with Leo\n(1191.4, 1197.64)  our Pope and Richard our Bishop and all the clergy. Remember also our brothers and sisters\n(1197.64, 1203.96)  who have fallen asleep in the hope of the resurrection and all who have died in your mercy,\n(1204.6, 1211.48)  welcome them into the light of your face. Have mercy on us all we pray that with the blessed\n(1211.48, 1217.36)  Virgin Mary, Mother of God, Saint Joseph, her spouse, with the blessed apostles, Saint\n(1217.36, 1221.44)  Bridget, Saint Augustine, and all the saints who have pleased you throughout\n(1221.44, 1226.6)  the ages that we may merit to be co-heirs to eternal life and may praise\n(1226.6, 1233.76)  and glorify you through your Son, Jesus Christ. Through him and with him and in\n(1233.76, 1238.44)  him, O God Almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all glory and honor\n(1238.44, 1248.1)  is yours forever and ever. At the Savior's command and formed by divine\n(1248.1, 1260.24)  teaching, we dare to pray now. Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.\n(1260.24, 1266.56)  Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive\n(1266.56, 1272.76)  those who trespass against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us\n(1272.76, 1278.76)  from evil. Deliver us Lord we pray from every evil graciously grant peace in our\n(1278.76, 1284.4)  days that by the help of your mercy we may be always free from sin and safe\n(1284.4, 1288.92)  from all distress as we await the blessed hope and the coming of our Lord\n(1288.92, 1298.08)  Jesus Christ Lord Jesus Christ who said to your apostles peace I leave you my\n(1298.08, 1302.36)  peace I give you look not now on our sins but on the faith of your church\n(1302.36, 1307.56)  and graciously grant her peace and unity in accordance with your will who live\n(1307.56, 1314.32)  and reign forever and ever the peace of the Lord be with you always let's offer\n(1314.32, 1318.6)  for each other some sign of Christ's peace.\n(1334.6, 1340.2)  Lamb of God, you take away sins of the world.\n(1344.32, 1352.56)  our scenarios. Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world. Grant us peace.\n(1361.52, 1366.32)  Behold the Lamb of God. Behold him who takes away the sins of the world.\n(1366.32, 1371.92)  Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb. Lord, I am not worthy that you should\n(1371.92, 1377.92)  under, under on my roof, but only say the word and my soul shall be healed.\n(1431.92, 1438.92)  Okay.\n(1438.92, 1445.92)  Okay.\n(1445.92, 1452.92)  Okay.\n(1452.92, 1459.92)  Okay.\n(1459.92, 1486.04)  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n(1546.04, 1576.0)  Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.\n(1576.0, 1581.68)  Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.\n(1581.68, 1587.92)  Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death.\n(1587.92, 1591.76)  Let us pray.\n(1591.76, 1598.0)  May the communion in your sacrament that we have consumed save us, O Lord, and conform\n(1598.0, 1602.2)  us in the light of your truth, through Christ our Lord.\n(1602.2, 1604.64)  The Lord be with you.\n(1604.64, 1609.22)  May Almighty God bless you, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.\n(1609.22, 1610.28)  Our Mass has ended.\n(1610.28, 1611.28)  We go in peace.\n(1611.28, 1613.4)  Have a great day, everybody.\n",

Christ have mercy. Lord have mercy. May almighty God have mercy on us,\n(318.5, 323.54)  forgive us our sins, and bring us to everlasting life. Let us pray.\n(325.86, 323.54) \n(332.26, 338.86)  O God, who caused the minds of the faithful to unite in a single purpose, grant your people to love what you command and to desire what you promise, that amid the uncertainties of\n(338.86, 345.42)  this world, our hearts may be fixed on that place where true gladness is found.\n(345.42, 349.5)  Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of\n(349.5, 361.18)  Holy Spirit, God forever and ever.\n(361.18, 364.46)  A reading from the Book of Numbers.\n(364.46, 369.94)  The whole congregation of the children of Israel arrived in the Desert of Zin in the\n(369.94, 374.98)  first month, and the people settled in Kadesh.\n(374.98, 380.98)  It was here that Miriam died, and here that she was buried.\n(380.98, 387.54)  As the community had no water, they held a council against Moses and Aaron, the people\n(387.54, 395.04)  contended with Moses, exclaiming, What that we too, would that we too, had perished with\n(395.04, 398.88)  our kinsmen in the Lord's presence?\n(398.88, 404.72)  Why have you brought the Lord's assembly into the desert, where we and our livestock\n(404.72, 411.72)  are dying. Why did you lead us out of Egypt, only to bring us to this wretched place, which\n(413.26, 420.26)  has neither grain nor figs nor vines nor pomegranates? Here there is not even water to drink. But\n(423.44, 429.68)  Moses and Aaron went away from the assembly to the entrance of the meeting tent. There\n(429.68, 436.68)  fell prostrate. Then the glory of the Lord appeared to them, and the Lord said to Moses,\n(437.78, 444.62)  Take your staff and assemble the community, you and your brother Aaron, and in their presence\n(444.62, 451.62)  order the rock to yield its waters. From the rock you shall bring forth water for the congregation\n(452.68, 451.62) \n(455.96, 462.16)  and their livestock to drink. So Moses took his staff from its place before the Lord as he was ordered.\n(462.16, 468.32)  He and Aaron assembled the community in front of the rock, where he said to them,\n(468.32, 477.62)  Listen to me, you rebels, and are we to bring water for you out of this rock?\n(477.62, 484.62)  In raising his hand, Moses struck the rock twice with his staff, and water gushed out\n(484.82, 489.7)  in abundance for the people and their livestock to drink.\n(489.7, 496.42)  But the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, Because you were not faithful to Me in showing forth\n(496.42, 502.28)  My sanctity before the children of Israel, you shall not lead this community into the\n(502.28, 505.46)  land I will give them.\n(505.46, 512.08)  These are the waters of Meribah, where the children of Israel contented against the Lord,\n(512.08, 516.72)  and where the Lord revealed His sanctity among them.\n(516.72, 520.12)  The word of the Lord.\n(520.12, 522.48)  The Responsorial Psalm.\n(522.48, 530.8)  If today you hear His voice, harden not your hearts.\n(530.8, 533.68)  Come let us sing joyfully to the Lord.\n(533.68, 537.08)  Let us acclaim the rock of our salvation.\n(537.08, 541.2)  Let us come into His presence with thanksgiving.\n(541.2, 549.0)  Let us joyfully sing psalms to Him.\n(549.0, 551.74)  Come let us bow down and worship.\n(551.74, 557.44)  Let us kneel before the Lord who made us, for He is our God and we are the people He\n(557.44, 564.44)  shepherds, the flock he guides. Oh, that today you would hear his voice. Harden not your\n(568.7, 575.7)  hearts as at Maribah, as in the day of Massa in the desert, where your fathers tested me.\n(576.5, 583.5)  They tested me though they had seen my works.\n(587.44, 608.78)  The Lord be with you.\n(608.78, 615.54)  A reading from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew.\n(615.54, 619.06)  Jesus went into the region of Caesarea Philippi\n(619.06, 621.66)  and he asked his disciples,\n(621.66, 624.88)  who do people say that the Son of Man is?\n(625.94, 629.54)  They replied, some say John the Baptist,\n(629.54, 632.06)  others, Elijah, still others, Jeremiah,\n(632.06, 634.66)  or one of the prophets.\n(634.66, 638.46)  He said to them, but who do you say that I am?\n(639.7, 643.18)  Simon Peter said in reply, you are the Christ,\n(643.18, 645.98)  the Son of the living God.\n(645.98, 648.36)  Jesus said to him in reply,\n(648.36, 651.66)  blessed are you, Simon, son of Jonah,\n(651.66, 655.38)  for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you,\n(655.38, 657.3)  but my heavenly Father.\n(658.34, 662.1)  And so I say to you, you are Peter,\n(662.1, 665.5)  and upon this rock I will build my church,\n(665.5, 667.14)  and the gates of the netherworld\n(667.14, 669.84)  shall not prevail against it.\n(669.84, 673.96)  I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven.\n(673.96, 677.86)  Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven,\n(677.86, 682.08)  and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\n(683.04, 685.76)  Then he strictly ordered his disciples\n(685.76, 689.26)  not to tell anyone that he was the Christ.\n(690.28, 694.04)  From that time on, Jesus began to show his disciples\n(694.04, 698.74)  that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer greatly\n(698.74, 702.46)  from the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes,\n(702.46, 706.9)  and be killed, and on the third day be raised.\n(708.18, 712.54)  Then Peter took Jesus aside and began to rebuke him.\n(712.54, 717.54)  God forbid, Lord, no such thing shall ever happen to you.\n(718.94, 723.94)  He turned and said to Peter, get behind me, Satan.\n(724.1, 726.96)  You are an obstacle to me.\n(726.96, 731.96)  You are thinking not as God does, but as human beings do.\n(733.56, 735.92)  The Gospel of the Lord.\n(742.12, 745.48)  In today's Gospel, we witness a dramatic moment\n(745.48, 748.08)  in Peter's journey of faith.\n(748.08, 752.28)  First, he makes a bold and beautiful confession.\n(752.28, 755.7)  You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.\n(756.8, 755.7) \n(763.26, 768.42)  and for this Jesus praises him and calls him blessed and recognizing that this truth was revealed to Peter not by flesh and blood as he said in the gospel but\n(768.42, 774.54)  by the Father God the Father in heaven but then we see moments later Peter\n(774.54, 781.42)  stumbles when Jesus begins to speak about his coming suffering and death\n(781.42, 789.42)  Peter protests, God forbid, Lord, this shall never happen to you, and then Jesus\n(789.42, 798.46)  rebukes him sharply, get behind me Satan. This shift reminds us of how quickly our\n(798.46, 805.82)  human thinking can get in the way of God's plan. Peter, of course, out of love\n(805.82, 814.14)  and fear wants to protect Jesus from the cross, but in doing so he unknowingly\n(814.14, 821.3)  tries to stand in the way of salvation, the means by which Jesus of course\n(821.3, 831.02)  through the cross saved us. Jesus I think calls us all to recognize who he is he\n(831.02, 840.7)  is, but also to follow Him, even when the path leads to the cross, to suffering.\n(840.7, 848.26)  True discipleship means surrendering our own expectations and trusting in the wisdom of\n(848.26, 853.14)  God, even when it's difficult to understand.\n(853.14, 859.5)  So maybe today we could ask the Lord for two graces in our lives.\n(859.5, 862.76)  the courage first to proclaim God,\n(862.76, 867.76)  to proclaim Jesus as the Christ, the Lord of our lives,\n(869.06, 874.06)  and then ask for the grace of humility to follow the Lord,\n(875.24, 879.18)  even when the road leads through suffering,\n(879.18, 881.22)  through uncertainty in our life,\n(882.32, 885.82)  always knowing that the resurrection\n(885.82, 889.04)  and new life follows those uncertainties\n(889.04, 893.68)  of those sufferings that we all experience in our lives.\n(897.12, 898.04)  Let us pray.\n(900.68, 903.26)  With trust in the Lord and his plan for us,\n(903.26, 905.8)  we offer him our petitions.\n(905.8, 907.78)  We pray for the church.\n(907.78, 910.52)  May God bless her with more holy men and women\n(910.52, 912.9)  to serve God and his people\n(912.9, 914.92)  in the priesthood and religious life.\n(914.92, 916.64)  We pray to the Lord.\n(918.64, 916.64) \n(925.4, 931.44)  For all leaders of the world, may the Lord inspire them to secure peace and unity for their people, especially the leaders that are now engaging in war with the innocent\n(931.44, 932.96)  and vulnerable.\n(932.96, 936.64)  We pray to the Lord.\n(936.64, 942.76)  For those burdened by sickness and for their caretakers, may Jesus grant them strength,\n(942.76, 944.68)  hope, and patience and love.\n(944.68, 946.34)  we pray to the Lord.\n(948.22, 950.66)  For all of us here at this mass struggling\n(950.66, 953.1)  with any doubts in our faith,\n(953.1, 956.24)  may Jesus the good shepherd embrace all of us\n(956.24, 959.66)  in his loving arms, we pray to the Lord.\n(961.46, 963.52)  And for those who have died in faith,\n(963.52, 965.5)  today we remember our parishioners,\n(965.5, 968.84)  our family and friends who have gone before us.\n(968.84, 971.24)  May they experience eternal salvation\n(971.24, 974.88)  in God's merciful care, we pray to the Lord.\n(976.68, 979.28)  Lord God, please hear and answer these prayers\n(979.28, 981.04)  according to your will.\n(981.04, 983.38)  We ask them through Christ our Lord.\n(1001.24, 1022.92)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through your goodness we have received\n(1022.92, 1027.68)  the bread we offer you, fruit of the earth and work of human hands, it will become for\n(1027.68, 1034.36)  us the bread of life. Blessed are you Lord God of all creation for through\n(1034.36, 1038.76)  your goodness we have received the wine we offer you, fruit of the vine and work\n(1038.76, 1043.88)  of human hands it will become our spiritual drink.\n(1057.68, 1066.68)  Pray, brothers and sisters, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God, the almighty Father,\n(1066.68, 1082.68)  the Lord who gained for yourself a people by adoption through the one sacrifice once offered for all.\n(1082.68, 1089.68)  Bestow graciously on us, we pray, the gifts of unity and peace in your church through Christ our Lord.\n(1089.68, 1098.68)  The Lord be with you. Lift up your hearts. Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.\n(1098.68, 1105.68)  It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, always and everywhere to give you thanks,\n(1105.68, 1109.68)  Lord, Holy Father, Almighty and Eternal God.\n(1109.68, 1115.68)  For although you have no need of our praise, yet our thanksgiving is itself your gift,\n(1115.68, 1122.68)  since our praises add nothing to your greatness, but profit us for salvation through Christ our Lord.\n(1122.68, 1129.68)  And so, in company with the choirs of angels, we praise you, and with joy we now proclaim,\n(1129.68, 1136.68)  Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts, heaven and earth are full of your glory,\n(1136.68, 1139.08)  Hosanna in the highest.\n(1139.08, 1142.32)  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord,\n(1142.32, 1144.08)  Hosanna in the highest.\n(1146.56, 1150.12)  You are indeed holy, O Lord, the fount of all holiness.\n(1150.12, 1153.16)  Make holy, therefore, these gifts, we pray,\n(1153.16, 1156.88)  by sending down your Spirit upon them like the dewfall,\n(1156.88, 1159.68)  so that they may become for us the body and blood\n(1159.68, 1162.7)  of our Lord Jesus Christ.\n(1162.7, 1165.72)  At the time he was betrayed and entered willingly\n(1165.72, 1171.2)  into his passion he took bread and giving thanks broke it and gave it to his\n(1171.2, 1177.84)  disciples saying take this all of you and eat of it for this is my body which\n(1177.84, 1191.92)  will be given up for you in a similar way when supper was ended he took the\n(1191.92, 1196.78)  chalice and once more giving thanks he gave it to his disciples saying take\n(1196.78, 1201.76)  this all of you and drink from it for this is the chalice of my blood the\n(1201.76, 1206.28)  blood of the new and eternal covenant which will be poured out for you and for\n(1206.28, 1221.76)  many for the forgiveness of sins do this in memory of me the mystery of faith we\n(1221.76, 1228.64)  We proclaim your death, O Lord, and profess your resurrection until you come again.\n(1228.64, 1233.72)  Therefore, as we celebrate the memorial of His death and resurrection, we offer you,\n(1233.72, 1239.16)  Lord, the bread of life and the chalice of salvation, giving thanks that you have held\n(1239.16, 1243.36)  us worthy to be in your presence and minister to you.\n(1243.36, 1249.04)  Humbly, we pray that, partaking of the body and blood of Christ, we may be gathered into\n(1249.04, 1251.72)  one by the Holy Spirit.\n(1251.72, 1254.82)  Remember, Lord, your Church spread throughout the world\n(1254.82, 1257.62)  and bring her to the fullness of charity,\n(1257.62, 1260.5)  together with Leo, our Pope, and Richard, our Bishop,\n(1260.5, 1261.94)  and all the clergy.\n(1262.9, 1265.22)  Remember also our brothers and sisters\n(1265.22, 1269.22)  who have fallen asleep in the hope of the resurrection,\n(1269.22, 1272.02)  and all who have died in your mercy.\n(1272.02, 1275.34)  Welcome them into the light of your face,\n(1275.34, 1277.42)  and have mercy on us all, we pray,\n(1277.42, 1280.62)  that with the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God,\n(1280.62, 1284.18)  St. Joseph, her spouse, with the blessed apostles,\n(1284.18, 1287.34)  St. Bridget, St. Augustine, and all the saints\n(1287.34, 1290.1)  who have pleased you throughout the ages,\n(1290.1, 1293.5)  that we may merit to be co-heirs to eternal life\n(1293.5, 1295.5)  and may praise and glorify you\n(1295.5, 1297.98)  through your Son, Jesus Christ.\n(1300.94, 1303.14)  Through him and with him and in him,\n(1303.14, 1306.54)  O God, almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\n(1306.54, 1315.58)  All glory and honor is Yours, forever and ever.\n(1315.58, 1320.68)  At the Savior's command and formed by divine teaching, we dare to pray now.\n(1320.68, 1325.04)  Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name.\n(1325.04, 1330.28)  Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.\n(1330.28, 1335.4)  Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses,\n(1335.4, 1338.8)  as we forgive those who trespass against us,\n(1338.8, 1341.32)  and lead us not into temptation,\n(1341.32, 1343.64)  but deliver us from evil.\n(1343.64, 1346.42)  Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil.\n(1346.42, 1349.14)  Graciously grant peace in our days,\n(1349.14, 1351.28)  that by the help of your mercy,\n(1351.28, 1355.38)  we may be always free from sin and safe from all distress,\n(1355.38, 1356.92)  as we await the blessed hope\n(1356.92, 1360.2)  in the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ.\n(1360.2, 1364.04)  The kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and forever.\n(1364.04, 1367.0)  Lord Jesus Christ, who said to your apostles,\n(1367.0, 1369.7)  peace I leave you, my peace I give you.\n(1369.7, 1372.98)  Look not now on our sins, but on the faith of your church,\n(1372.98, 1375.4)  and graciously grant your peace and unity\n(1375.4, 1377.32)  in accordance with your will,\n(1377.32, 1380.42)  to live and reign forever and ever.\n(1380.42, 1383.96)  The peace of the Lord be with you always.\n(1383.96, 1387.08)  Let's offer each other some sign of Christ's peace.\n(1394.04, 1411.96)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1411.96, 1417.24)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1417.24, 1423.96)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, grant us peace.\n(1423.96, 1425.74)  Behold the Lamb of God.\n(1425.74, 1428.84)  Behold Him who takes away the sins of the world.\n(1428.84, 1432.32)  Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb.\n(1432.32, 1435.96)  Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof,\n(1435.96, 1439.08)  but only say the word and my soul shall be healed.\n(1453.96, 1457.96)  Thank you for joining us today, and have a great rest of your\n(1457.96, 1459.96)  day.\n(1460.96, 1462.96)  Thank you for joining us today, and

joining us today, and have a great rest of your\n(1473.96, 1475.96)  day.\n(1477.96, 1478.96)  Thank you for joining us today, and have a great rest of your\n(1478.96, 1480.96)  day.\n(1603.96, 1615.52)  Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.\n(1615.52, 1620.48)  Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.\n(1620.48, 1626.44)  Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death.\n(1626.44, 1631.48)  Let us pray.\n(1631.48, 1637.04)  within us oh Lord we pray the healing work of your mercy and graciously\n(1637.04, 1642.72)  perfect and sustain us so that in all things we may please you through Christ\n(1642.72, 1650.8)  our Lord the Lord be with you may Almighty God bless you the father\n",

Lord have mercy. Let us pray. O God, who constantly raise up in your church new examples of virtue, grant that\n(368.92, 373.44)  we may follow so closely in the footsteps of the Bishop St. Alphonsus in\n(373.44, 378.64)  his zeal for souls, as to attain the same rewards that are his in heaven. Through\n(378.64, 382.68)  our Lord Jesus Christ, your son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the\n(382.68, 387.16)  Holy Spirit, God, for ever and ever.\n(399.0, 404.32)  A reading from the book of Leviticus. The Lord said to Moses, these are the\n(404.32, 408.08)  festivals of the Lord which you shall celebrate at their proper time with the\n(408.08, 413.26)  sacred assembly. The Passover of the Lord falls on the 14th day of the first month\n(413.26, 418.16)  at the evening twilight. The 15th day of this month is the Lord's feast of\n(418.16, 423.38)  unleavened bread. For seven days you shall eat unleavened bread. On the first of\n(423.38, 428.58)  these days you shall hold a sacred assembly and do no sort of work. On each\n(428.58, 433.02)  of the seven days you shall offer an oblation to the Lord. Then on the seventh\n(433.02, 437.46)  day you shall again hold a sacred assembly and do no sort of work. The Lord\n(437.46, 441.66)  said to Moses speak to the children of Israel and tell them when you come into\n(441.66, 445.64)  the land which I am giving you and reap your harvest you shall bring a sheaf of\n(445.64, 450.2)  the firstfruits of your harvest to the priest who shall wave the sheaf before\n(450.2, 454.52)  the Lord that it may be acceptable for you on the day after the Sabbath the\n(454.52, 458.84)  priest shall do this beginning with the day after the Sabbath the day on which\n(458.84, 464.04)  you bring the wave offering sheaf you shall count seven full weeks and then on\n(464.04, 469.32)  On the day after the seventh week, the fiftieth day, you shall present the new serial offering\n(469.32, 470.92)  to the Lord.\n(470.92, 475.0)  The tenth of this seventh month is the Day of Atonement, when you shall hold a sacred\n(475.0, 479.48)  assembly and mortify yourselves, and offer an oblation to the Lord.\n(479.48, 484.2)  The fifteenth day of this seventh month is the Lord's Feast of Booths, which shall continue\n(484.2, 485.9)  for seven days.\n(485.9, 490.96)  On the first day there shall be a sacred assembly, and you shall do no sort of work.\n(490.96, 496.04)  For seven days you shall offer an oblation to the Lord, and on the eighth day you shall\n(496.04, 500.44)  again hold a sacred assembly, and offer an oblation to the Lord.\n(500.44, 504.04)  On that solemn closing you shall do no sort of work.\n(504.04, 508.64)  These therefore are the festivals of the Lord, on which you shall proclaim a sacred assembly,\n(508.64, 513.64)  and offer in his oblation to the Lord burnt offerings and serial offerings, sacrifices\n(513.64, 516.96)  and libations, as prescribed for each day.\n(516.96, 520.66)  The word of the Lord.\n(520.66, 526.32)  Sing with joy to God our help.\n(526.32, 531.12)  Take up a melody and sound the timbrel, the pleasant harp in the lyre, below the trumpet\n(531.12, 538.04)  of the new moon, at the full moon on our solemn feast.\n(538.04, 542.56)  For it is a statute in Israel, an ordinance of the God of Jacob, who made it a decree\n(542.56, 549.36)  for Joseph when he came forth from the land of Egypt.\n(549.36, 553.9)  There shall be no strange god among you, nor shall you worship any alien god.\n(553.9, 578.1)  I the Lord am your God, who led you forth from the land of Egypt.\n(578.1, 586.0)  the Lord be with you. A reading from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew. Jesus\n(586.0, 590.32)  came to his native place and taught the people in their synagogue. They were\n(590.32, 595.12)  astonished and said where did this man get such wisdom and mighty deeds? Is he\n(595.12, 599.68)  not the carpenter's son? Is not his mother named Mary and his brothers James,\n(599.68, 605.04)  Joseph, Simon, and Judas? Are not his sisters all with us? Where did this man\n(605.04, 610.5)  get all this and they took offense at him but Jesus said to them a prophet is\n(610.5, 615.36)  not without honor except in his native place and in his own house and he did\n(615.36, 620.1)  not work many mighty deeds there because of their lack of faith the gospel of the\n(620.1, 629.66)  Lord I feel this special connection with st. Alphonsus Liguori the founder of the\n(629.66, 634.44)  Redemptor's order a bishop and doctor of the church in the 18th century because\n(634.44, 640.84)  Because it was on this day, ten years ago, that much to the credit of Father Jim DePeri,\n(640.84, 643.88)  that I finally started to go to daily Mass.\n(643.88, 651.96)  And attending daily Mass really changed my life because worship shapes our hearts.\n(651.96, 655.8)  And that's the premise of the whole book of Leviticus.\n(655.8, 662.32)  Leviticus is after the story of the Israelites being taken out of slavery in Egypt, but it's\n(662.32, 667.74)  not just a matter of being free from slavery to succeed, they need to be free\n(667.74, 672.5)  for worship. And so that's a really important lesson in the spiritual life.\n(672.5, 678.3)  It's not just about avoiding sins, right? If there's this vacuum in our heart, we\n(678.3, 682.74)  need something to love. And that's where worship comes in, and that's why the book\n(682.74, 689.46)  of Leviticus is so detailed, because God is the one who teaches us to worship. And\n(689.46, 698.42)  and that is the goal of the mass is that we learn to love God in our worship. It shapes our hearts\n(698.42, 705.38)  and that's why we do these devotions on the first Friday of every month because these these\n(705.38, 711.14)  devotions, they shape us. They teach us to love properly, to love with the heart of Christ.\n(711.94, 718.58)  Every single saint becomes a saint because they awaken that desire for God and all of the people\n(718.58, 721.78)  around them. Alphonsus Liguori did this primarily\n(721.78, 726.66)  through his writings and his teachings and much like all of the saints he\n(726.66, 730.74)  focused on the two most essential and basic things\n(730.74, 734.42)  the Eucharist and Mary. If our spiritual life\n(734.42, 738.74)  is not rooted in the Eucharist and Mary we have nothing.\n(738.74, 742.82)  Alphonsus Liguori used to say if we pray in front of the Eucharist and we pray to\n(742.82, 746.82)  Mary God will save us, God will make us holy\n(746.82, 753.62)  and if we don't, we have nothing. Visits to the Blessed Sacrament were a main part of his writing\n(753.62, 759.22)  throughout the day, even if we can't walk into our churches. We should try to recall the Holy\n(759.22, 764.58)  Communion we received, and I will leave you with this. This was Alphonsus Liguori's most famous\n(764.58, 771.94)  reflection on the Blessed Virgin Mary. He loved the scene at Cana because he said Mary interceded\n(772.9, 771.94) \n(778.7, 785.54)  without even being asked. She noticed that they were in trouble and so she made a request to Jesus. So he said how much more involved would she get if we\n(785.54, 790.26)  asked her to intercede in our lives? And so we asked Mary through the\n(790.26, 795.0)  intercession of St. Alphonsus Liguori to help us love worship so that we can be\n(795.0, 799.66)  made and live in the image of God. Let's stand and make our petitions known to\n(799.66, 806.02)  Heavenly Father. We pray for Pope Leo and for Bishop Richard Henning and for all\n(806.02, 809.68)  bishops throughout the church. May God give them the grace to be true shepherds\n(809.68, 814.06)  of souls who point us to the importance of the Eucharist and Mary. We pray to the\n(814.06, 819.22)  Lord. We pray for all civil leaders, governments, and elected officials\n(819.22, 822.86)  throughout the world. May they enact policies that protect the church and\n(822.86, 826.62)  give her the freedom to be herself so the kingdom of God can be spread to\n(826.62, 831.9)  every corner of the globe, we pray to the Lord. We pray for an increase of\n(831.9, 836.06)  vocations to the priesthood into the religious life, especially from members\n(836.06, 840.1)  from our own parishes and our own families. May God call many men and\n(840.1, 846.46)  women to give their lives entirely to his worship, we pray to the Lord. And we\n(846.46, 850.98)  pray for the McCarthy and the O'Donovan families for whom this mass is offered,\n(850.98, 856.18)  we pray to the Lord. Heavenly Father, we make these prayers with great\n(856.18, 859.7)  confidence as we ask them for the intercession of Saint Alphonsus Liguori\n(859.7, 863.42)  and Mary, our Morning Star and Gate of Heaven, and we speak them in the name of\n(863.42, 868.3)  Jesus, her Son, who is Lord forever and ever.\n(946.18, 961.22)  Pray, brothers and sisters, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God the Almighty\n(961.22, 969.94)  Father.\n(969.94, 975.82)  Be pleased, O Lord, to enkindle our hearts with the celestial fire of your Spirit.\n(975.82, 981.7)  as you granted St. Alphonsus should celebrate these mysteries and by them\n(981.7, 988.4)  offer himself to you as a holy sacrifice through Christ our Lord. The Lord be with\n(988.4, 997.06)  you. Lift up your hearts. Let us give thanks to the Lord our God. It is truly\n(997.06, 1000.88)  right and just our duty and our salvation always and everywhere to give\n(1000.88, 1005.92)  you thanks, Lord Holy Father Almighty and Eternal God, for you are praised in the\n(1005.92, 1010.36)  company of your saints, and in crowning their merits you crown your own gifts. By\n(1010.36, 1014.24)  their way of life you offer us an example, by communion with them you give\n(1014.24, 1019.24)  us companionship, by their intercession share support, so that encouraged by so\n(1019.24, 1024.84)  great a cloud of witnesses, we may run as victors in the race before us, and win\n(1024.84, 1029.02)  with them the imperishable crown of glory through Christ our Lord. And so\n(1029.02, 1033.72)  with the angels and archangels, and with a great multitude of the saints, we sing\n(1033.72, 1040.74)  the hymn of your praise, as without end we acclaim. Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of\n(1040.74, 1044.3)  hosts, heaven and earth are full of your glory.\n(1044.3, 1049.74)  Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.\n(1049.74, 1056.62)  Hosanna in the highest. You are indeed holy, O Lord, and all you have created\n(1056.62, 1061.7)  created rightly gives you praise. For through your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, by the power\n(1061.7, 1066.34)  and working of the Holy Spirit, you give life to all things and make them holy, and you\n(1066.34, 1071.18)  never cease to gather a people to yourself, so that from the rising of the sun to its\n(1071.18, 1077.58)  setting, a pure sacrifice may be offered to your name. Therefore, O Lord, we humbly implore\n(1077.58, 1083.22)  you, by the same Spirit graciously make holy these gifts we have brought to you for consecration,\n(1083.22, 1088.74)  they may become the body and blood of your Son our Lord Jesus Christ at whose\n(1088.74, 1094.18)  command we celebrate these mysteries. For on the night he was betrayed, he himself\n(1094.18, 1100.06)  took bread and giving you thanks he said the blessing broke the bread and gave it\n(1100.06, 1109.3)  to his disciples saying take this all of you and eat of it for this is my body\n(1109.3, 1129.78)  which will be given up for you in a similar way when supper was ended he\n(1129.78, 1134.34)  took the chalice and giving you thanks he said the blessing and gave the\n(1134.34, 1142.18)  chalice to his disciples saying take this all of you and drink from it for\n(1142.18, 1147.62)  this is the chalice of my blood the blood of the new and eternal covenant\n(1147.62, 1153.38)  which will be poured out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins do this\n(1153.38, 1157.22)  in memory of me\n(1164.34, 1177.6)  The mystery of faith. Save us, Savior of the world, for by your cross and resurrection\n(1177.6, 1183.02)  you have set us free. Therefore, O Lord, as we celebrate the memorial of the saving passion\n(1183.02, 1187.62)  of your Son, his wondrous resurrection and ascension into heaven, and as we look forward\n(1187.62, 1193.22)  to his second coming, we offer you in thanksgiving this holy and living sacrifice. Look, we pray,\n(1193.22, 1195.18)  upon the oblation of your church\n(1195.18, 1197.32)  and recognizing the sacrificial victim\n(1197.32, 1200.64)  by whose death you will to reconcile us to yourself.\n(1200.64, 1202.1)  Grant that we who are nourished\n(1202.1, 1204.1)  by the body and blood of your son\n(1204.1, 1205.5)  and filled with his Holy Spirit\n(1205.5, 1208.38)  may become one body, one spirit in Christ.\n(1208.38, 1210.9)  May he make of us an eternal offering to you\n(1210.9, 1213.7)  so that we may obtain an inheritance with your elect,\n(1213.7, 1215.14)  especially with the most blessed\n(1215.14, 1217.02)  Virgin Mary, Mother of God,\n(1217.02, 1218.98)  with blessed Joseph, her spouse,\n(1218.98, 1221.42)  with your blessed apostles and glorious martyrs,\n(1221.42, 1224.78)  with St. Alphonsus Liguori, and with all the saints,\n(1224.78, 1227.22)  on whose constant intercession in your presence\n(1227.22, 1229.26)  we rely for unfailing help.\n(1229.26, 1232.8)  May this sacrifice of our reconciliation, we pray, O Lord,\n(1232.8, 1235.7)  advance the peace and salvation of all the world.\n(1235.7, 1237.7)  Be pleased to confirm in faith and charity\n(1237.7, 1240.36)  your pilgrim church on earth, with your servant Leo,\n(1240.36, 1243.74)  our pope, and Richard, our bishop, the order of bishops,\n(1243.74, 1245.62)  all the clergy, and the entire people\n(1245.62, 1247.38)  you have gained for your own.\n(1247.38, 1250.5)  Listen graciously to the prayers of this family,\n(1250.5, 1252.46)  whom you have summoned before you.\n(1252.46, 1254.74)  In your compassion, oh merciful Father,\n(1254.74, 1256.42)  gather to yourself all your children\n(1256.42, 1258.14)  scattered throughout the world.\n(1258.14, 1260.24)  To our departed brothers and sisters,\n(1260.24, 1261.56)  and to all who are pleasing to you\n(1261.56, 1263.46)  at their passing from this life,\n(1263.46, 1265.4)  give kind admittance to your kingdom.\n(1265.4, 1268.34)  There we hope to enjoy forever the fullness of your glory,\n(1268.34, 1269.74)  through Christ our Lord,\n(1269.74, 1272.5)  through whom you bestow on the world all that is good.\n(1275.74, 1278.5)  Through him, and with him, and in him,\n(1278.5, 1282.54)  O God, Almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\n(1282.54, 1286.18)  all glory and honor is yours forever and ever.\n(1288.44, 1292.38)  At the Savior's command, informed by divine teaching,\n(1292.38, 1296.76)  we dare to say, our Father, who art in heaven,\n(1296.76, 1298.46)  hallowed be thy name.\n(1298.46, 1301.34)  Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,\n(1301.34, 1303.5)  on earth as it is in heaven.\n(1303.5, 1306.1)  Give us this day our daily bread,\n(1306.1, 1308.5)  and forgive us our trespasses,\n(1308.5, 1311.86)  as we forgive those who trespass against us,\n(1311.86, 1314.22)  and lead us not into temptation,\n(1314.22, 1316.14)  but deliver us from evil.\n(1316.14, 1318.78)  Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil.\n(1318.78, 1320.92)  Graciously grant peace in our days,\n(1320.92, 1322.3)  that by the help of your mercy,\n(1322.3, 1325.88)  we may be always free from sin and safe from all distress,\n(1325.88, 1327.14)  as we await the blessed hope\n(1327.14, 1329.94)  and the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ.\n(1333.98, 1329.94) \n(1337.78, 1341.9)  Lord Jesus Christ who said to your apostles peace I leave you my peace I give you look not in our sins but on the faith of your church and graciously\n(1341.9, 1345.14)  grant her peace and unity in accordance with your will who live and reign\n(1345.14, 1350.82)  forever and ever the peace of the Lord be with you always let us offer each\n(1350.82, 1359.78)  other the sign of peace Lamb of God you take away the sins of the world have\n(1359.78, 1361.74)  Have mercy on us.\n(1361.74, 1364.94)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world.\n(1364.94, 1367.06)  Have mercy on us.\n(1367.06, 1370.32)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world.\n(1370.32, 1387.8)  Grant us peace.\n(1387.8, 1393.44)  the Lamb of God, behold him who takes away the sins of the world.

Jesus came to his native place\n(670.94, 673.14)  and taught the people in their synagogue.\n(673.14, 675.42)  They were astonished and said,\n(675.42, 678.4)  where did this man get such wisdom and mighty deeds?\n(678.4, 680.66)  Is he not the carpenter's son?\n(680.66, 682.6)  Is not his mother named Mary\n(682.6, 686.3)  and his brother James, Joseph, Simon and Judas?\n(686.3, 688.76)  Are not his sisters all with us?\n(688.76, 691.08)  Where did this man get all this?\n(691.08, 693.02)  And they took offense at him.\n(693.02, 694.54)  But Jesus said to them,\n(694.54, 698.02)  a prophet is not without honor except in his native place\n(698.02, 699.74)  and in his own house.\n(699.74, 702.18)  And he did not work many mighty deeds there\n(702.18, 704.5)  because of their lack of faith.\n(704.5, 705.98)  The gospel of the Lord.\n(710.54, 713.02)  I always feel a special connection\n(713.02, 714.58)  with St. Alphonsus Liguori,\n(714.58, 716.7)  the founder of the Redemptor's Order\n(716.7, 720.3)  and the great moral theologian of the 18th century\n(720.3, 722.22)  whose feast we celebrate today\n(722.22, 724.78)  because it was on this day 10 years ago\n(724.78, 727.74)  with a lot of encouragement from Father Jim DePerri\n(727.74, 730.28)  that I started to go to daily mass.\n(730.28, 734.56)  And attending daily mass really changed my life\n(734.56, 739.56)  because worship, what we worship, it shapes our hearts.\n(739.72, 743.32)  And prior to really leaning into the worship of God,\n(743.32, 747.52)  I, like many of us, was worshiping things of the world.\n(747.52, 749.88)  And so that's why the book of Leviticus,\n(749.88, 752.1)  which we hear from in the first reading today,\n(752.1, 754.88)  and we're going to be reading throughout the next few days\n(754.88, 760.88)  the daily mass is so detailed about all of these little intricate details that\n(760.88, 766.32)  center around worship because this is the trajectory in the spiritual life. In\n(766.32, 771.88)  the book of Exodus God calls the people out of slavery. He removes them from\n(771.88, 779.68)  their sin but then their whole hearts need to be reordered to him and that's\n(779.68, 782.82)  That's where worship comes into place.\n(782.82, 784.78)  The same is true for us.\n(784.78, 786.22)  The goal of the spiritual life\n(786.22, 790.22)  is not to just avoid moral evils.\n(790.22, 794.28)  It's to love worship, to love God.\n(794.28, 796.12)  And that's why every Friday,\n(796.12, 797.98)  the first Friday of the month,\n(797.98, 801.02)  we try to do these first Friday devotions\n(801.02, 803.52)  because these acts of devotions\n(803.52, 807.52)  which the Lord Himself gave detailed prescriptions\n(807.52, 812.64)  are ways of learning to love his worship and cling to his heart.\n(812.64, 815.6)  Saint Alphonsus Liguori, just like any saint,\n(815.6, 819.36)  becomes a saint because they remind the people around them\n(819.36, 823.24)  that they're made for God, that they need to worship him\n(823.24, 828.0)  with ardor and fervor to be transformed into his image\n(828.0, 830.32)  and to reflect that to the world.\n(830.32, 834.8)  And Alphonsus Liguori did this by two simple ways.\n(834.8, 837.24)  He promoted two things.\n(837.24, 840.54)  the Eucharist and the Blessed Virgin Mary.\n(840.54, 842.14)  St. Alphonsus Liguori said this,\n(842.14, 843.78)  if we don't have the Eucharist,\n(843.78, 847.68)  we don't have the Blessed Virgin Mary, we have nothing.\n(847.68, 850.78)  And if we have them, we have everything.\n(850.78, 853.56)  And so the spiritual life is really simple.\n(854.46, 859.36)  We cling to God daily in the worship of Him in the Eucharist\n(859.36, 862.9)  and as Alphonsus Liguori said, we go to Mary.\n(862.9, 864.1)  I'll leave you with this.\n(864.1, 867.22)  He often would remind people in his sermons\n(867.22, 870.3)  about the wedding feast at Cana,\n(870.3, 874.74)  because he said Mary came to the aid of the couple\n(874.74, 876.32)  without them even asking.\n(877.44, 878.98)  She noticed they were in trouble,\n(878.98, 880.9)  and she went and helped them.\n(880.9, 885.18)  He said imagine how much faster she would come in your life\n(885.18, 887.74)  if you asked for her help.\n(887.74, 891.46)  And so today we ask Alphonsus Liguori\n(891.46, 894.02)  and the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary\n(894.02, 897.02)  to teach us to love worship and cling to it\n(897.02, 899.48)  so we can be transformed and made anew.\n(899.48, 902.66)  So let us make our petitions known to our Heavenly Father.\n(903.94, 906.9)  We pray for Pope Leo and for Bishop Richard Henning\n(906.9, 909.02)  and for all bishops throughout the church.\n(909.02, 912.22)  May God give them the grace to be true shepherds of souls\n(912.22, 914.92)  who point us to the importance of the Eucharist and Mary.\n(914.92, 916.12)  We pray to the Lord.\n(917.62, 919.46)  We pray for all civil leaders, governments,\n(919.46, 921.52)  and elected officials throughout the world.\n(921.52, 924.1)  May they enact policies that protect the church\n(924.1, 925.94)  and give her the freedom to be herself\n(925.94, 927.54)  so the kingdom of God can be spread\n(927.54, 930.14)  to every corner of the globe, we pray to the Lord.\n(931.1, 932.94)  We pray for an increase of vocations\n(932.94, 935.06)  to the priesthood and to the religious life,\n(935.06, 937.16)  especially for members from our own parishes\n(937.16, 938.54)  and our own families.\n(938.54, 941.48)  May God call many men and women to give their lives\n(941.48, 944.18)  entirely to his worship, we pray to the Lord.\n(945.74, 947.14)  And we pray for our parishioners\n(947.14, 949.84)  for whom this mass is offered, we pray to the Lord.\n(951.22, 954.02)  Heavenly Father, we make these prayers with great confidence\n(954.02, 955.58)  as we ask them for the intercession\n(955.58, 957.66)  of St. Alphonsus Liguori and Mary,\n(957.66, 959.5)  our morning star and gate of heaven.\n(959.5, 961.8)  And we speak it in the name of Jesus, her son,\n(961.8, 963.66)  was Lord forever and ever.\n(963.66, 964.5)  Amen.\n(984.02, 985.02)  All right.\n(1013.02, 1015.02)  you\n(1043.02, 1059.8)  Pray, brothers and sisters, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God, the almighty\n(1059.8, 1068.8)  Father.\n(1068.8, 1071.84)  Be pleased, O Lord, to enkindle our hearts\n(1071.84, 1075.24)  with the celestial fire of your Spirit,\n(1075.24, 1077.88)  just as you granted that St. Alphonsus\n(1077.88, 1080.0)  should celebrate these mysteries,\n(1080.0, 1084.32)  and by them offer himself to you as a holy sacrifice,\n(1084.32, 1085.72)  through Christ our Lord.\n(1086.84, 1088.04)  The Lord be with you.\n(1089.08, 1090.58)  Lift up your hearts.\n(1091.76, 1094.08)  Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.\n(1095.4, 1098.52)  It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,\n(1098.52, 1100.96)  always and everywhere to give you thanks.\n(1100.96, 1103.32)  Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God,\n(1103.32, 1104.88)  through Christ our Lord.\n(1104.88, 1107.28)  For as on the festival of St. Alphonsus,\n(1107.28, 1109.42)  you bid your church rejoice.\n(1109.42, 1112.72)  So too you strengthen her by the example of his holy life,\n(1112.72, 1114.76)  teach her by his words of preaching,\n(1114.76, 1117.4)  and keep her safe in answer to his prayers.\n(1117.4, 1120.18)  And so with the company of angels and saints,\n(1120.18, 1121.92)  we sing to him of your praise,\n(1121.92, 1124.24)  as without end we acclaim.\n(1124.24, 1126.54)  Holy, holy, holy,\n(1126.54, 1128.5)  Lord God of hosts,\n(1128.5, 1130.98)  Heaven and Earth are full of your glory.\n(1130.98, 1132.94)  Hosanna in the highest.\n(1132.94, 1136.0)  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.\n(1136.0, 1137.92)  Hosanna in the highest.\n(1139.9, 1141.78)  You are indeed holy, O Lord,\n(1141.78, 1144.26)  and all you have created rightly gives you praise.\n(1144.26, 1147.02)  For through your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ,\n(1147.02, 1149.54)  by the power and working of the Holy Spirit,\n(1149.54, 1152.14)  you give life to all things and make them holy,\n(1152.14, 1154.94)  and you never cease to gather a people to yourself,\n(1154.94, 1157.74)  so that from the rising of the sun to its setting,\n(1157.74, 1161.14)  a pure sacrifice may be offered to your name.\n(1161.14, 1163.9)  Therefore, O Lord, we humbly implore you,\n(1163.9, 1166.78)  by the same Spirit graciously make holy these gifts\n(1166.78, 1169.06)  we have brought to you for consecration,\n(1169.06, 1171.98)  that they may become the body and blood\n(1171.98, 1174.7)  of your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ,\n(1174.7, 1177.74)  at whose command we celebrate these mysteries.\n(1177.74, 1180.26)  For on the night he was betrayed,\n(1180.26, 1183.38)  he himself took bread, and giving you thanks,\n(1183.38, 1186.04)  he said the blessing, broke the bread,\n(1186.04, 1188.64)  and gave it to his disciples, saying,\n(1189.7, 1193.98)  take this, all of you, and eat of it,\n(1193.98, 1198.98)  for this is my body, which will be given up for you.\n(1201.8, 1204.04)  And then, in a similar way,\n(1215.3, 1204.04) \n(1219.0, 1225.32)  in a similar way when supper was ended he took the chalice and giving you thanks he said the blessing and gave the chalice to his disciples saying take\n(1225.32, 1233.12)  this all of you and drink from it for this is the chalice of my blood the\n(1233.12, 1235.7)  the blood of the new and eternal covenant,\n(1235.7, 1238.14)  which will be poured out for you and for many\n(1238.14, 1240.52)  for the forgiveness of sins.\n(1240.52, 1243.16)  Do this in memory of me.\n(1246.38, 1243.16) \n(1262.84, 1268.92)  The mystery of faith. Save us, savior of the world, for by your cross and resurrection you have set us free.\n(1268.92, 1274.52)  Therefore, O Lord, as we celebrate the memorial of the saving passion of your son, his wondrous\n(1274.52, 1279.16)  resurrection and ascension into heaven, and as we look forward to his second coming, we\n(1279.16, 1282.16)  offer you in thanksgiving this holy and living sacrifice.\n(1282.16, 1287.58)  Look, we pray, upon the oblation of your church, in recognizing the sacrificial victim by whose\n(1287.58, 1292.68)  death you willed to reconcile us to yourself, grant that we who are nourished by the body\n(1292.68, 1297.36)  and blood of your son, and filled with his Holy Spirit, may become one body, one spirit\n(1297.36, 1303.36)  in Christ. May he make of us an eternal offering to you, so that we may obtain an inheritance\n(1303.36, 1308.76)  with her elect, especially with the most blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God, with blessed Joseph\n(1308.76, 1313.96)  her spouse, with your blessed apostles and glorious martyrs, with Saint Alphonsus Liguori,\n(1313.96, 1318.98)  and with all the saints, on whose constant intercession in your presence we rely for\n(1318.98, 1324.72)  unfailing help. May this sacrifice of our reconciliation, we pray, O Lord, advance the\n(1324.72, 1327.04)  peace and salvation of all the world.\n(1327.04, 1329.12)  Be pleased to confirm in faith and charity\n(1329.12, 1330.64)  your pilgrim church on earth,\n(1330.64, 1332.76)  with your servant Leo, our pope,\n(1332.76, 1335.32)  and Richard, our bishop, the order of bishops,\n(1335.32, 1337.24)  all the clergy, and the entire people\n(1337.24, 1339.04)  you have gained for your own.\n(1339.04, 1342.16)  Listen graciously to the prayers of this family,\n(1342.16, 1344.0)  whom you have summoned before you.\n(1344.0, 1346.48)  In your compassion and merciful father,\n(1346.48, 1348.2)  gather to yourself all your children\n(1348.2, 1349.9)  scattered throughout the world.\n(1349.9, 1352.1)  To our departed brothers and sisters,\n(1352.1, 1353.4)  and to all who are pleasing to you\n(1353.4, 1355.36)  at their passing from this light,\n(1355.36, 1357.32)  give kind admittance to your kingdom,\n(1357.32, 1360.36)  there we hope to enjoy forever the fullness of your glory,\n(1360.36, 1361.8)  through Christ our Lord,\n(1361.8, 1364.6)  through whom you bestow on the world all that is good.\n(1368.64, 1371.0)  Through him and with him and in him,\n(1371.0, 1375.04)  O God, almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\n(1375.04, 1378.64)  all glory and honor is yours, forever and ever.\n(1380.54, 1378.64) \n(1386.9, 1393.4)  At the Savior's command and formed by divine teaching we dare to say our Father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done on\n(1393.4, 1398.92)  earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our\n(1398.92, 1404.36)  trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us and lead us not into\n(1404.36, 1409.88)  into temptation but deliver us from evil. Deliver us Lord we pray from every evil.\n(1409.88, 1414.28)  Graciously grant peace in our days that by the help of your mercy we may be\n(1414.28, 1419.04)  always free from sin and safe from all distress as we await the blessed hope and\n(1419.04, 1423.32)  the coming of our Savior Jesus Christ.\n(1425.36, 1429.92)  Lord Jesus Christ who said to your apostles peace I leave you my peace I\n(1429.92, 1434.08)  give you look not on our sins but on the faith of your church and graciously\n(1434.08, 1438.56)  grant her peace and unity in accordance with your will, who live and reign forever and ever.\n(1439.2, 1444.24)  The peace of the Lord be with you always. Let us offer each other the sign of peace.\n(1447.44, 1454.8)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us. Lamb of God, you take away the\n(1454.8, 1462.08)  sins of the world, have mercy on us. Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, grant us peace.\n(1464.08, 1484.4)  Behold the Lamb of God. Behold him who takes away the sins of the world. Blessed are those\n(1484.4, 1489.12)  called to the supper of the Lamb. Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under\n(1489.12, 1492.88)  my root, but only say the word and my soul shall be healed.\n(1519.12, 1542.62)  It was not you who chose me, says the Lord, but I who chose you and appointed you to go\n(1542.62, 1549.62)  and bear fruit, fruit that will last.\n(1752.62, 1775.96)  Let us pray.\n(1775.96, 1784.96)  O God, who gave us St. Alphonsus to be a faithful steward and preacher of this great mystery,\n(1784.96, 1790.96)  grant that your faithful may receive it often, and receiving it, to praise you without end,\n(1790.96, 1792.96)  through Christ our Lord.\n(1792.96, 1794.96)  The Lord be with you.\n(1794.96, 1799.96)  May almighty God bless you, the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit.\n(1799.96, 1802.96)  Go forth, the Mass has ended.\n(1802.96, 1808.4)  St. Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle.\n",

        "transcript": "(0.0, 3.06)  The Lord be with you.\n(3.06, 7.14)  As we gather this beautiful morning, we ask the Lord to strengthen us with His love and\n(7.14, 8.34)  forgiveness.\n(8.34, 12.8)  As we celebrate these sacred mysteries, we call to my God's love for us.\n(12.8, 14.44)  Lord have mercy.\n(14.44, 16.44)  Christ have mercy.\n(16.44, 17.44)  Lord have mercy.\n(17.44, 19.84)  May Almighty God have mercy on us.\n(19.84, 24.96)  May the Lord forgive us our sins and bring us to everlasting life.\n(24.96, 26.96)  Let us pray.\n(26.96, 35.06)  O God, who through the grace of adoption shows us to be children of light, grant, we pray,\n(35.06, 39.7)  that we may not be wrapped in the darkness of error, but always be seen to stand in the\n(39.7, 44.3)  bright light of truth, through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with\n(44.3, 49.26)  you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God forever and ever.\n(49.26, 50.26)  Amen.\n(50.26, 60.98)  Let's now be attentive to God's sacred word.\n(60.98, 65.42)  A reading from the book of Genesis.\n(65.42, 70.94)  Abraham and the men who visited him by the terebinth of Mamre set out from there and\n(70.94, 74.06)  looked down towards Sodom.\n(74.06, 78.06)  Abraham was walking with them to see them on their way.\n(78.06, 85.78)  The Lord reflected, Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do, now that he is to become\n(85.78, 92.86)  a great and populous nation, and all the nations of the earth are to find blessing in him?\n(92.86, 99.94)  Indeed, I have singled him out, that he may direct his children and his household after\n(99.94, 107.86)  him to keep the way of the Lord by doing what is right and just, so that the Lord may carry\n(107.86, 113.86)  into effect for Abraham the promises he made about him.\n(113.86, 119.02)  Then the Lord said, the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah\n(119.02, 123.18)  is so great, and their sin so grave,\n(123.18, 125.66)  that I must go down and see whether or not\n(125.66, 130.3)  their actions fully correspond to the cry against them that\n(130.3, 132.1)  comes to me.\n(132.1, 135.1)  I mean to find out.\n(135.1, 138.9)  While the two men walked on farther toward Sodom,\n(138.9, 142.86)  the Lord remained standing before Abraham.\n(142.86, 146.86)  Then Abraham drew nearer to him and said,\n(146.86, 150.98)  will you sweep away the innocent with the guilty?\n(150.98, 155.1)  Suppose there were 50 innocent people in the city.\n(155.1, 157.34)  Would you wipe out the place rather than\n(157.34, 162.38)  spare it for the sake of the 50 innocent people within it?\n(162.38, 165.46)  Far be it from you to do such a thing,\n(165.46, 168.42)  to make the innocent die with the guilty,\n(168.42, 173.26)  so that the innocent and the guilty would be treated alike.\n(173.26, 178.3)  Should not the judge of all the world act with justice?\n(178.3, 183.06)  The Lord replied, if I find 50 innocent people\n(183.06, 186.74)  in the city of Sodom, I will spare the whole place\n(186.74, 188.8)  for their sake.\n(188.8, 191.36)  Abraham spoke up again.\n(191.36, 194.54)  See how I am presuming to speak to my lord,\n(194.54, 197.04)  though I am dust and ashes.\n(197.04, 200.88)  What if there are five less than 50 innocent people?\n(200.88, 204.84)  Will you destroy the whole city because of those five?\n(204.84, 210.64)  He answered, I will not destroy it if I find 45 there.\n(210.64, 213.32)  But Abraham persisted, saying, what\n(213.32, 215.76)  if only 40 are found there?\n(215.76, 221.96)  He replied, I will forbear doing it for the sake of the party.\n(221.96, 227.92)  Then Abraham said, let not my Lord grow impatient if I go on.\n(227.92, 230.6)  What if only 30 are found there?\n(230.6, 237.16)  He replied, I will forbear doing it if I can find but 30 there.\n(237.16, 239.76)  Still Abraham went on.\n(239.76, 242.88)  Since I have thus dared speak to my Lord,\n(242.88, 245.6)  what if there are no more than 20?\n(245.6, 250.24)  He answered, I will not destroy it for the sake of the 20.\n(250.24, 255.32)  But he persisted, please, let not my Lord grow angry\n(255.32, 258.4)  if I speak up this last time.\n(258.4, 261.28)  What if there are at least 10 there?\n(261.28, 267.84)  He replied, for the sake of those 10, I will not destroy it.\n(267.84, 269.76)  The Lord departed as soon as he had\n(269.76, 274.84)  finished speaking with Abraham, and Abraham returned home.\n(274.84, 280.28)  The Word of the Lord.\n(280.28, 282.68)  The Responsorial Psalm.\n(282.68, 289.12)  The Lord is kind and merciful.\n(289.12, 292.84)  Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all my being.\n(292.84, 295.08)  Bless His holy name.\n(295.08, 302.88)  Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all His benefits.\n(302.88, 305.4)  He pardons all your iniquities.\n(305.4, 307.96)  He heals all your ills.\n(307.96, 310.9)  He redeems your life from destruction.\n(310.9, 314.0)  He crowns you with kindness and compassion.\n(317.68, 320.72)  Merciful and gracious is the Lord,\n(320.72, 324.76)  slow to anger and abounding in kindness.\n(324.76, 327.28)  He will not always chide,\n(327.28, 329.82)  nor does he keep his wrath forever.\n(332.88, 340.88)  Not according to our sins does he deal with us, nor does he requite us according to our crimes.\n(340.88, 349.88)  For as the heavens are high above the earth, so surpassing is his kindness to those who fear him.\n(362.88, 370.56)  The Lord be with you.\n(370.56, 374.08)  A reading from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew.\n(374.08, 379.92)  When Jesus saw a crowd around him, he gave orders to cross to the other shore.\n(379.92, 385.84)  A scribe approached and said to him, Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.\n(385.84, 391.84)  Jesus answered him, Foxes have dens and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man\n(391.84, 394.4)  has nowhere to rest his head.\n(394.4, 396.68)  Another of the other disciples said to him,\n(396.68, 399.64)  Lord, let me go first to bury my father.\n(399.64, 403.52)  But Jesus answered him, follow me\n(403.52, 405.92)  and let the dead bury their dead.\n(405.92, 411.4)  The gospel of the Lord, praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ.\n(411.4, 413.16)  As we journey forth with Matthew,\n(413.16, 415.08)  as you know in the readings in Ordinary Time\n(415.08, 418.48)  that we begin this week 14, Sunday in Ordinary Time,\n(418.48, 421.68)  the whole golden thread through the scripture of Matthew\n(421.68, 422.98)  is discipleship.\n(422.98, 427.98)  To be a disciple is to imitate Christ, walk in his shoes.\n(428.92, 433.16)  And so today we have the situation that is very harsh.\n(433.16, 436.0)  I like one of the reflections I found that it says,\n(436.0, 437.42)  our friends in today's gospel,\n(437.42, 440.6)  a man who appears willing to become Jesus' disciple\n(440.6, 442.52)  makes a reasonable request.\n(442.52, 445.48)  Lord, let me go first and bury my father.\n(445.48, 448.96)  But the man receives a shocking rebuke from Jesus.\n(448.96, 452.06)  follow me and let the dead bury the dead.\n(453.0, 457.8)  There's kind of harsh words in that really, it's an incident.\n(457.8, 461.42)  But basically what Jesus is teaching his disciples,\n(461.42, 464.44)  that I'm sending you out into the most worth,\n(464.44, 468.18)  most difficult journey in the days to come.\n(468.18, 470.18)  And you're gonna be really disappointed\n(470.18, 473.26)  and overcome and want to escape.\n(473.26, 476.54)  You need to build trust at the highest level.\n(476.54, 480.2)  Now, mind you, we don't usually have to make\n(480.2, 483.06)  such a terrible choice like in the gospel today.\n(483.06, 485.64)  Normally, our love for God and our love for family\n(485.64, 488.26)  don't come into conflict, but this is a sort\n(488.26, 491.42)  of spiritual exercise and experiment.\n(491.42, 494.68)  What if it came down to God, what do you choose?\n(494.68, 496.94)  Your family or do you choose God?\n(496.94, 499.58)  Well, we choose God, but when I was preaching\n(499.58, 503.82)  on this one time in a retreat for college students,\n(503.82, 506.0)  one of the students said to me, you know,\n(506.0, 510.2)  but yesterday you said God is a God of second chances\n(510.2, 511.8)  when it comes to reconciliation.\n(511.8, 515.32)  The woman at the well that he forgave her had let her go.\n(515.32, 517.68)  He said, I take my chance and bury my father.\n(517.68, 520.3)  Well, I said, well, you're listening to the gospel\n(520.3, 523.2)  and that's fine, but he's building a foundation\n(523.2, 524.72)  for us to trust.\n(524.72, 528.12)  When I read this reading, I thought about my uncle,\n(528.12, 532.0)  as you've heard me speak before, when my grandmother died\n(532.0, 535.96)  and it was 1965 and we were so looking forward\n(535.96, 540.32)  for my uncle, who never came out of the abbey in 35 years,\n(540.32, 542.6)  we were hoping he'd come to the funeral.\n(542.6, 546.24)  But the rule and regulation was that he couldn't come home\n(546.24, 549.66)  from Spencer, and we felt so bad.\n(549.66, 554.64)  But that was the idea of ministry and vocation.\n(554.64, 556.56)  And later on, the Sisters of Notre Dame\n(556.56, 559.1)  or the Sisters of Saint Joseph will tell you other stories\n(559.1, 561.2)  that some of them could go to a funeral\n(561.2, 563.9)  but stay in the back, some of them could never go\n(563.9, 567.94)  to a gathering, you know, for a social after the funeral,\n(567.94, 570.48)  and they were all doing it for the vocation\n(570.48, 573.44)  of dedication to Christ first.\n(573.44, 576.48)  I remember about a few years ago,\n(576.48, 579.76)  I went to the anniversary of the Trappistine Abbey,\n(579.76, 581.48)  and Cardinal Law was there.\n(581.48, 583.08)  And he said, oh, Michael, I know you're friendly\n(583.08, 584.0)  with the Trappistines.\n(584.0, 586.96)  I said, oh, yes, I'm looking forward to the social\n(586.96, 590.04)  and the lawn because, you know, I know some of them,\n(590.04, 591.9)  but I don't know a lot of them.\n(591.9, 595.8)  And so I got to the lawn party and I said to the superior,\n(595.8, 597.82)  where are the other sisters?\n(597.82, 601.46)  Oh, she said, father, we have a consecrated life.\n(601.46, 604.4)  She said, they weren't allowed to come.\n(604.4, 606.92)  I said, well, who made that decision?\n(606.92, 608.4)  She said, Cardinal Law did.\n(608.4, 611.32)  I said, oh my God, I felt so bad.\n(611.32, 613.28)  A big celebration and they weren't able\n(613.28, 616.1)  to leave the climate to come to the beautiful lawn party.\n(616.1, 617.56)  You know what, I left.\n(617.56, 620.36)  I said, I'm not, I'm shaking the dust from my feet.\n(620.36, 622.88)  but their dedication to Christ,\n(622.88, 624.96)  but their many forms of dedication.\n(624.96, 626.56)  Now with the Vatican Council thing,\n(626.56, 628.86)  God, things have changed, you know,\n(628.86, 630.42)  so we look forward to that.\n(630.42, 634.68)  But even when I was ordained a priest 48 years ago,\n(634.68, 636.56)  I said they certainly would let my uncle\n(636.56, 638.28)  come home to my ordination.\n(638.28, 639.32)  Guess what?\n(639.32, 641.32)  He wasn't allowed to come home.\n(641.32, 642.48)  So what did I do?\n(642.48, 643.96)  The next week I went to the Abbey\n(643.96, 646.24)  and celebrated my first Mass there as well.\n(646.24, 648.96)  So God always gives us another way out,\n(648.96, 652.58)  But this is to build foundation, not just the story,\n(652.58, 654.78)  the more difficult things beyond this\n(654.78, 657.42)  that we have to deal with, trusting in God's grace.\n(657.42, 659.28)  Where do we get that trust?\n(659.28, 661.08)  The Eucharist, God's prayer.\n(661.08, 663.68)  We give it to him and say, let me get through this.\n(663.68, 666.6)  I don't agree with it, Lord, but show me another way.\n(666.6, 668.76)  Let us stand for our prayer of the faithful.\n(668.76, 670.84)  Loving God, show me another way.\n(670.84, 672.74)  When we have a difficulty in situations\n(672.74, 674.48)  that we feel are correct and right,\n(674.48, 676.76)  and sometimes we're certainly right,\n(676.76, 679.64)  May the Lord guide us always in gentleness, kindness,\n(679.64, 681.52)  and openness, we pray to the Lord.\n(682.54, 685.2)  For those who carry heavy crosses,\n(685.2, 687.5)  dealing with family members and Alzheimer's\n(687.5, 689.92)  and difficulty and pain and suffering,\n(689.92, 692.16)  may God give them the strength they need each day,\n(692.16, 693.48)  we pray to the Lord.\n(694.46, 697.36)  For this beautiful parish in St. Bridget's in St. Augustine,\n(697.36, 700.12)  for the wonderful faith and the wonderful image\n(700.12, 702.92)  you give to the whole diocese, the archdiocese,\n(702.92, 706.16)  you're in such a beautiful place of prayer\n(706.16, 709.0)  for the whole church to see by your dedication\n(709.0, 711.36)  and all the wonderful work that Father Casey\n(711.36, 715.04)  and all the associates have done for the church.\n(715.04, 717.12)  We pray to the Lord.\n(717.12, 718.84)  First parishioners and the sisters\n(718.84, 721.06)  and all those that have been dedicating their lives\n(721.06, 723.88)  to build this beautiful church in the memory of our faith,\n(723.88, 725.9)  we pray to the Lord.\n(725.9, 728.16)  We pray for this hot weather for those that are alone\n(728.16, 730.8)  in need of our prayer, we pray to the Lord.\n(731.76, 733.28)  Let us pray to our Lady.\n(733.28, 736.2)  Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.\n(736.2, 737.48)  Blessed art thou among women,\n(737.48, 739.5)  and blessed are the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.\n(739.5, 742.22)  Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for our sinners,\n(742.22, 744.06)  now at the hour of our death, amen.\n(763.28, 765.28)  All right, we're going to go ahead and take a few minutes to\n(765.28, 767.28)  take a few more minutes to\n(792.28, 799.28)  Pray, my brothers and sisters, that this sacrifice may be acceptable to God the Almighty Father.\n(806.28, 819.28)  O God, who graciously accomplished the effects of your mysteries, grant, we pray, that the deeds by which we serve you may be worthy of these sacred gifts through Christ our Lord.\n(822.28, 835.76)  The Lord be with you, lift up your hearts, let us give thanks to the Lord our God.\n(835.76, 840.36)  It is truly right in just our duty and our salvation, always and everywhere to give you\n(840.36, 845.68)  thanks, Father most holy, through your beloved Son Jesus Christ, your Word to whom you made\n(845.68, 850.8)  all things, whom you sent as our Savior and Redeemer, incarnate by the Holy Spirit and\n(850.8, 851.8)  born of the Virgin.\n(851.8, 854.98)  fulfilling your will and gaining for your holy people.\n(854.98, 857.78)  He stretched out his hands as he enjoyed his passion,\n(857.78, 861.32)  so to break the bonds of death and manifest the resurrection.\n(861.32, 863.62)  And so with all the angels and all the saints,\n(863.62, 867.42)  we declare your glory as with one voice we acclaim.\n(867.42, 871.0)  Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts,\n(871.0, 873.24)  heaven and earth are full of your glory,\n(873.24, 874.96)  Hosanna in the highest.\n(874.96, 877.36)  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord,\n(877.36, 878.96)  Hosanna in the highest.\n(881.8, 886.4)  You are indeed holy, O Lord, the fount of all holiness.\n(886.4, 891.3)  May holy these gifts, we pray, by sending down Your Spirit upon them like the dewfall,\n(891.3, 897.4)  that they may become for us the body and blood of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.\n(897.4, 901.8)  At the time He was betrayed and entered willingly into His passion,\n(901.8, 905.8)  He took bread and giving thanks, broke it, gave it to His disciples, saying,\n(905.8, 911.8)  Take this, all of you, and eat of it, for this is My body, which will be given up for you.\n(917.8, 921.8)  In a similar way, when supper was ended, He took the chalice, once more giving thanks.\n(921.8, 926.8)  He gave it to His disciples, saying, Take this, all of you, and drink from it.\n(926.8, 931.8)  For this is the chalice of My blood, the blood of the new and eternal covenant,\n(931.8, 936.8)  which will be put out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins.\n(936.8, 938.8)  Do this in memory of me.\n(947.8, 949.8)  The mystery of faith.\n(949.8, 955.8)  We proclaim your death, O Lord, and profess your resurrection until you come again.\n(961.8, 965.16)  Therefore, as we celebrate the memorial of his death\n(965.16, 968.44)  and resurrection, we offer you, Lord, the bread of life\n(968.44, 971.44)  and the chalice of salvation, giving thanks\n(971.44, 974.6)  that you held us worthy to be in your presence\n(974.6, 976.24)  and minister to you.\n(976.24, 980.08)  Humbly, we pray that partaking of the body and blood\n(980.08, 984.68)  of Christ, we may be gathered into one by the Holy Spirit.\n(984.68, 988.0)  Remember, Lord, your church spread throughout the world.\n(988.0, 990.52)  Bring her to the fullness of charity,\n(990.52, 993.16)  Together with Leo, our Pope, your servant,\n(993.16, 995.48)  our Bishop Richard, and all the clergy,\n(995.48, 997.76)  remember this morning our prayers\n(997.76, 1000.1)  for the parishioners of our parish this day.\n(1002.12, 1004.28)  Remember also our brothers and sisters\n(1004.28, 1007.2)  who have fallen asleep in the hope of the resurrection\n(1007.2, 1009.5)  and all who have died in your mercy.\n(1009.5, 1011.84)  Welcome them into the light of your face.\n(1011.84, 1013.88)  Have mercy on us all, we pray,\n(1013.88, 1017.04)  with the blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God,\n(1017.04, 1020.28)  Saint Joseph, her chaste spouse, with the apostles,\n(1020.28, 1022.68)  gay to heaven, Saint Augustine, Saint Bridget,\n(1022.68, 1024.8)  and all your saints who have pleased you\n(1024.8, 1027.68)  throughout the ages, that we may merit to be coheirs\n(1027.68, 1031.8)  to eternal life, and praise and glorify you\n(1031.8, 1034.24)  through your Son, Jesus Christ.\n(1036.04, 1039.0)  Through him, with him, in him, O God, almighty Father,\n(1039.0, 1041.16)  in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\n(1041.16, 1046.16)  all glory and honor is yours forever and ever, amen.\n(1047.04, 1056.24)  At the Savior's command, informed by divine teaching, we dare to say our Father, who art\n(1056.24, 1062.64)  in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is\n(1062.64, 1063.64)  in heaven.\n(1063.64, 1069.12)  Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who\n(1069.12, 1075.2)  trespass against us, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.\n(1075.2, 1080.78)  Remember us, Lord, we pray from every evil, graciously grant peace in our days, that by\n(1080.78, 1087.7)  the help of your mercy we may be always free from sin, safe from all distress, as we await\n(1087.7, 1094.14)  the blessed hope and the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ, for the kingdom, the power and\n(1094.14, 1096.9)  the glory are yours now and forever.\n(1096.9, 1104.82)  Lord Jesus Christ, you said to your apostles, peace I leave you, my peace I give you.\n(1104.82, 1112.3)  Look not on our sins, but on the faith of your church, and graciously grant her peace\n(1112.3, 1118.7)  and unity in accordance with your will to live and reign forever and ever.\n(1118.7, 1122.62)  On this beautiful day, may the peace of the Lord be with you always.\n(1122.62, 1134.34)  Let us offer each other a sign of that peace.\n(1134.34, 1138.34)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1138.34, 1142.34)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1142.34, 1147.34)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, grant us peace.\n(1151.34, 1155.34)  Behold the Lamb of God, behold him who takes away the sins of the world.\n(1155.34, 1158.34)  How blessed are we who are called to the supper of the Lamb.\n(1158.34, 1160.34)  Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof,\n(1160.34, 1163.34)  but only say the word and my soul shall be healed.\n(1163.34, 1176.86)  be healed. May the volume of Christ keep us safe for each other.\n(1193.34, 1195.34)  Thank you so much for joining us, and we'll see you next time.\n(1223.34, 1235.34)  Spirit and grace, here in this year,\n(1235.34, 1242.34)  You are the wind that breathes through the field.\n(1242.34, 1252.34)  Gather the wheat and form us in Christ.\n(1252.34, 1260.34)  Come be our source and breath of life.\n(1260.34, 1269.34)  In the breathless, broken and shared,\n(1269.34, 1277.34)  Christ is our life, whose presence we bear.\n(1277.34, 1286.84)  Come, O Spirit, make your praise reveal,\n(1286.84, 1291.84)  all is holy near.\n(1297.34, 1304.84)  Spirit and Grace, here in this field,\n(1304.84, 1312.32)  You are the life that flows through the vine.\n(1312.32, 1321.8)  Gather this drink and form a soup of rice.\n(1321.8, 1329.78)  Come, be our source and God of life.\n(1329.78, 1338.26)  In the bread that's broken and shattered,\n(1338.26, 1346.24)  Christ is our life, whose presence we bear.\n(1346.24, 1355.72)  Come, O Spirit, make your grace reveal.\n(1355.72, 1361.72)  in this holy way.\n(1365.72, 1373.72)  Spirit and praise, here in this place,\n(1373.72, 1380.72)  who are the light that shines in this place,\n(1380.72, 1389.7)  Gather your feet, come and form us in Christ.\n(1389.7, 1397.68)  Come, we the heart, we come alive.\n(1397.68, 1405.66)  In the faithless covenant shine.\n(1405.66, 1413.64)  Jesus is our God, whose presence we bear.\n(1413.64, 1419.6)  The Holy Spirit, thank your grace,\n(1419.6, 1425.58)  we bear in his holy being.\n(1432.56, 1425.58) \n(1439.58, 1446.58)  Spirit of God, send me thus far.

        "transcript": "(60.0, 67.0)  So, thank you very much for joining us today, and we'll see you in the next session.\n(179.0, 186.0)  So, thank you very much for your time.\n(238.0, 267.0)  So, thank you very much for your time and I'll see you in the next session.\n(267.0, 287.64)  You have redeemed us Lord by your blood from every tribe and tongue and people and nation\n(287.64, 290.08)  and have made us into a kingdom for our God.\n(290.08, 293.52)  In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, amen.\n(293.52, 296.14)  The Lord be with you.\n(296.14, 300.1)  Today's Mass is offered for the repose of the soul of John Ridge and we celebrate a\n(300.1, 303.28)  votive Mass of the most precious blood of Jesus.\n(303.28, 307.4)  My brothers and sisters, let us acknowledge our sins and so prepare ourselves to celebrate\n(307.4, 310.8)  the sacred mysteries.\n(310.8, 317.52)  I confess to Almighty God and to you, my brothers and sisters, that I have greatly sinned in\n(317.52, 322.94)  my thoughts and in my words and what I have done and what I have failed to do through\n(322.94, 328.48)  my fault, through my fault, through my most grievous fault. Therefore, I ask the Blessed\n(328.48, 334.66)  Mary of a virgin, all the angels and saints, and you, my brothers and sisters, to pray\n(334.66, 340.08)  for me to the Lord our God. May Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us our sins, and\n(340.08, 350.42)  bring us to everlasting life. Lord have mercy, Christ have mercy, Lord have mercy, let us\n(350.42, 357.38)  pray. O God, who by the precious blood of your only begotten Son have redeemed the\n(357.38, 362.26)  whole world, preserve in us the work of your mercy so that ever honoring the\n(362.26, 367.14)  mystery of our salvation we may merit to obtain its fruits through our Lord Jesus\n(367.14, 371.94)  Christ your Son who lives in range with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit God\n(371.94, 374.94)  forever and ever.\n(380.42, 392.78)  A reading from the book of Genesis.\n(392.78, 398.14)  In the course of the night, Jacob arose, took his two wives with the two maidservants and\n(398.14, 402.42)  his eleven children and crossed the ford to Jabok.\n(402.42, 407.82)  After he had taken them across the sea and had brought over all his possessions, Jacob\n(407.82, 410.14)  was left there alone.\n(410.14, 413.98)  Then some man wrestled with him until the break of dawn.\n(413.98, 420.5)  When the man saw that he could not prevail over him, he struck Jacob's hip in the socket\n(420.5, 424.46)  so that the hip socket was wrenched as they wrestled.\n(424.46, 428.56)  The man then said, let me go for it is daybreak.\n(428.56, 432.52)  But Jacob said, I will not let you go until you bless me.\n(432.52, 435.02)  The man asked, what is your name?\n(435.02, 436.94)  He answered Jacob.\n(436.94, 443.58)  Then the man said, You shall no longer be spoken of as Jacob, but as Israel, because\n(443.58, 448.1)  you have contended with divine and human beings and have prevailed.\n(448.1, 453.06)  Jacob then asked him, Do you tell me your name, please?\n(453.06, 457.26)  He answered, Why should you want to know my name?\n(457.26, 459.46)  With that he bade him farewell.\n(459.46, 466.38)  Jacob named the place Penuel, because I have seen God face to face, and yet my life has\n(466.38, 470.58)  has been speared.\n(495.0, 470.58) \n(473.34, 476.02)  Jacob limped along because of his hip. That is why, to this day, the children of Israel\n(476.02, 480.26)  do not eat the sciatic muscle that is on the hip socket,\n(480.26, 483.58)  inasmuch as Jacob's hip socket was struck\n(483.58, 485.54)  at the sciatic muscle.\n(485.54, 486.76)  The word of the Lord.\n(489.98, 491.98)  Responsorial Psalm.\n(491.98, 495.62)  In justice, I shall behold your face, O Lord.\n(495.62, 499.14)  In justice, I shall behold your face, O Lord.\n(499.14, 503.46)  Hear, O Lord, a just suit, attend to my outcry,\n(503.46, 507.58)  hearken to my prayer from lips without deceit.\n(507.58, 510.94)  In justice I shall behold your face, O Lord.\n(510.94, 512.98)  From you let my judgment come,\n(512.98, 515.42)  your eyes behold what is right.\n(515.42, 518.62)  Though you test my heart, searching it in the night,\n(518.62, 520.74)  though you are triming with fire,\n(520.74, 523.62)  you shall find no malice in me.\n(523.62, 527.22)  In justice I shall behold your face, O Lord.\n(527.22, 530.64)  I call upon you, for you will answer me, O God.\n(530.64, 533.66)  Incline your ear to me, hear my word.\n(533.66, 535.54)  Show your wondrous mercies,\n(535.54, 539.22)  O Savior of those who flee from their foes.\n(539.22, 541.84)  O justice in the house, call your mercy.\n(543.28, 545.52)  Hide me in the shadow of your wings.\n(545.52, 548.26)  I, in justice, shall behold your face.\n(548.26, 552.02)  On waking, I shall be content in your presence.\n(552.02, 555.0)  In justice, I shall behold your face, O Lord.\n(557.22, 572.1)  The Lord be with you.\n(572.1, 577.22)  A reading from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew.\n(577.22, 582.32)  A demoniac who could not speak was brought to Jesus, and when the demon was driven out,\n(582.32, 583.98)  the mute man spoke.\n(583.98, 589.4)  The crowds were amazed, and said, Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel.\n(589.4, 594.06)  But the Pharisees said, He drives out demons by the prince of demons.\n(594.06, 598.82)  Jesus went around to all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming\n(598.82, 603.52)  the gospel of the kingdom, and curing every disease and illness.\n(603.52, 607.9)  At the sight of the crowds his heart was moved with pity for them, because they were troubled\n(607.9, 611.64)  and abandoned, like sheep without a shepherd.\n(611.64, 617.48)  And he said to his disciples the harvest is abundant but the laborers are few so ask the\n(617.48, 627.36)  master of the harvest to send out laborers for his harvest the gospel of the Lord.\n(627.36, 633.34)  We can't understand the Bible and therefore the root of the spiritual life without understanding\n(633.34, 637.68)  something about the character Jacob from the book of Genesis.\n(637.68, 643.04)  Jacob was one of the patriarchs of Israel. He was the son of Isaac and the grandson of Abraham.\n(643.6, 647.84)  And Jacob is a very important character to understand because you see, Jacob\n(648.96, 654.88)  was very rebellious against God and he relied on himself for most of his life.\n(655.52, 660.48)  And he just couldn't catch a break because of this. Because of his self-reliance, he was in\n(660.48, 668.88)  exile for 20 years and he tried to fix every problem on his own and then he has this profound\n(668.88, 677.36)  encounter with God because God intervenes on behalf of his people and so he wrestles with God\n(677.36, 682.24)  and that's what we hear in this passage which is a critical passage in the entire Bible\n(682.24, 689.6)  in the first reading and in this wrestling match Jacob receives a new name and that new name is\n(689.6, 696.96)  Israel and Jacob then becomes the father of the 12 tribes of Israel and Israel\n(696.96, 702.8)  the new name the new name that God gives him means those who wrestle with God.\n(702.8, 709.28)  This is so important because as members of the Catholic Church we are the new\n(709.28, 717.12)  Israel and so that name still applies. I share this with you because wrestling\n(717.12, 722.54)  with God is an essential part of the spiritual life, and don't we do that? We\n(722.54, 726.42)  wrestle with doubts, different temptations, struggles, our vocations,\n(726.42, 731.58)  whatever it may be, and this is not a sign of a defective spiritual life. In\n(731.58, 738.34)  fact, Israel, those who wrestle with God, are his chosen people because they're\n(738.34, 744.94)  engaged in this spiritual combat. And so we would do well today to reflect on, in\n(744.94, 748.6)  in our own spiritual life, are we wrestling with a question?\n(749.8, 752.74)  That's a good thing because it means\n(752.74, 755.26)  that we're taking the most essential thing,\n(755.26, 758.7)  our relationship with God, very seriously.\n(758.7, 761.14)  It's not something that we just float through\n(761.14, 762.9)  and rely on ourselves.\n(762.9, 764.58)  This is why God intervenes\n(764.58, 766.9)  and Jacob has this profound encounter.\n(766.9, 770.58)  And it is from this new name, from this engagement with God,\n(770.58, 773.22)  that him and his nation is blessed.\n(773.22, 775.78)  And so let us stand and make our petitions\n(775.78, 777.46)  known to our Heavenly Father.\n(778.58, 781.54)  We pray for Pope Leo and for Bishop Richard Henning\n(781.54, 783.82)  and for all bishops throughout the church.\n(783.82, 786.82)  May God give them the grace to be true shepherds of souls\n(786.82, 788.86)  so all can come to know the love of Christ.\n(788.86, 790.02)  We pray to the Lord.\n(791.48, 793.42)  We pray for all civil leaders, governments,\n(793.42, 795.3)  and elected officials throughout the world.\n(795.3, 797.94)  May they enact policies that protect the church\n(797.94, 799.82)  and give her the freedom to be herself\n(799.82, 801.56)  so the kingdom of God can be spread\n(801.56, 807.22)  every corner of the globe. We pray to the Lord. We pray for an increase of\n(807.22, 811.34)  vocations to the priesthood into the religious life, especially for members\n(811.34, 815.86)  from our own parishes and our own families. May God hear these prayers to\n(815.86, 821.96)  send out many laborers for the harvest. We pray to the Lord. And we pray for our\n(821.96, 826.02)  beloved dead, especially for John Ridge for whom this Mass is offered through\n(826.02, 829.88)  the mercy of God and with the help of our prayers. May he come to see Christ\n(829.88, 835.92)  face to face, we pray to the Lord. Heavenly Father, we make these prayers\n(835.92, 839.88)  with great confidence as we ask them through the intercession of Mary, our\n(839.88, 843.4)  Morning Star and Gate of Heaven, and we speak them in the name of Jesus, her Son,\n(843.4, 847.6)  who is Lord forever and ever.\n(918.88, 946.36)  Pray, brothers and sisters, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God, the Almighty\n(946.36, 947.36)  Father.\n(947.36, 959.46)  May we offer our oblation to your majesty, O Lord.\n(959.46, 965.46)  May we draw near in these mysteries to Jesus, the mediator of the new covenant, and celebrate\n(965.46, 971.2)  anew the sprinkling of his blood, in which lies all our salvation, through Christ our\n(971.2, 972.86)  Lord.\n(972.86, 975.54)  The Lord be with you.\n(975.54, 982.86)  up your hearts. Let us give thanks to the Lord our God. It is truly right and just\n(982.86, 987.68)  our duty and our salvation, always and everywhere to give you thanks, Lord Holy\n(987.68, 991.68)  Father Almighty and Eternal God, for through the saving passion of your Son,\n(991.68, 996.24)  the whole world has received a heart to confess the infinite power of your\n(996.24, 1001.22)  majesty, since by the wondrous power of the cross, your judgment on the world is\n(1001.22, 1005.42)  now revealed in the authority of Christ crucified. And so, Lord, with all the\n(1005.42, 1010.66)  the angels and saints. We too give you thanks as an exaltation we acclaim. Holy,\n(1010.66, 1016.9)  holy, holy, Lord God of hosts, heaven and earth are full of your glory.\n(1016.9, 1022.4)  Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.\n(1022.4, 1029.14)  Hosanna in the highest. You are indeed holy, O Lord, and all you have created\n(1029.14, 1033.98)  rightly gives you praise. For through your Son our Lord Jesus Christ, by the\n(1033.98, 1038.18)  power and working of the Holy Spirit you give life to all things and make them\n(1038.18, 1042.56)  holy and you never cease to gather a people to yourself so that from the\n(1042.56, 1047.42)  rising of the Sun to its setting a pure sacrifice may be offered to your name\n(1047.42, 1052.7)  therefore Oh Lord we humbly implore you by the same spirit graciously make holy\n(1052.7, 1056.42)  these gifts we have brought to you for consecration that they may become the\n(1056.42, 1062.1)  body and blood of your son our Lord Jesus Christ at whose command we\n(1062.1, 1067.68)  celebrate these mysteries for on the night he was betrayed he himself took\n(1067.68, 1072.72)  bread and giving you thanks he said the blessing broke the bread and gave it to\n(1072.72, 1082.08)  his disciples saying take this all of you and eat of it for this is my body\n(1082.08, 1086.96)  which will be given up for you\n(1092.1, 1104.58)  In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took the chalice, and giving you\n(1104.58, 1109.98)  thanks, he said the blessing, and gave the chalice to his disciples, saying,\n(1109.98, 1118.44)  Take this, all of you, and drink from it, for this is the chalice of my blood, the\n(1118.44, 1123.0)  blood of the new and eternal covenant, which will be poured out for you and for\n(1123.0, 1130.08)  many for the forgiveness of sins. Do this in memory of me.\n(1142.84, 1130.08) \n(1150.38, 1154.72)  The mystery of faith. Save us, Savior of the world, for by your cross and resurrection you have set us free. Therefore, O Lord, as we celebrate the memorial\n(1154.72, 1159.62)  of the saving Passion of your Son, his wondrous resurrection and ascension into heaven, and\n(1159.62, 1163.6)  And as we look forward to His Second Coming, we offer you in thanksgiving this holy and\n(1163.6, 1165.38)  living sacrifice.\n(1165.38, 1169.94)  Look we pray upon the oblation of your Church, and recognizing the sacrificial victim by\n(1169.94, 1173.46)  whose death you willed to reconcile us to yourself.\n(1173.46, 1177.22)  Grant that we who are nourished by the Body and Blood of your Son, and filled with His\n(1177.22, 1181.12)  Holy Spirit, may become one Body, one Spirit in Christ.\n(1181.12, 1185.32)  May He make of us an eternal offering to you, so that we may obtain an inheritance with\n(1185.32, 1189.76)  your elect, especially with the most blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God, with\n(1189.76, 1193.96)  blessed Joseph, her spouse, with your blessed apostles and glorious martyrs, and\n(1193.96, 1198.48)  with all the saints, on whose constant intercession in your presence we rely\n(1198.48, 1203.16)  for unfailing help. May this sacrifice of our reconciliation, we pray, O Lord,\n(1203.16, 1207.84)  advance the peace and salvation of all the world. Be pleased to confirm in faith\n(1207.84, 1211.92)  and charity your pilgrim church on earth, with your servant Leo, our Pope, and\n(1211.92, 1216.96)  Richard our bishop, the order of bishops, all the clergy, and the entire people you\n(1216.96, 1221.04)  have gained for your own. Listen graciously to the prayers of this\n(1221.04, 1225.6)  family, whom you have summoned before you, and your compassionate, merciful Father.\n(1225.6, 1229.96)  Gather to yourself all your children scattered throughout the world, to our\n(1229.96, 1233.84)  departed brothers and sisters, and to all who are pleasing to you at their passing\n(1233.84, 1237.76)  from this life. Give kind admittance to your kingdom. There we hope to enjoy\n(1237.76, 1241.72)  forever the fullness of your glory, through Christ our Lord, through whom you\n(1241.72, 1245.76)  bestow on the world all that is good.\n(1247.92, 1253.72)  Through him and with him and in him, O God Almighty Father, in the unity of the\n(1253.72, 1262.2)  Holy Spirit, all glory and honor is yours forever and ever. At the Savior's command\n(1262.2, 1269.6)  and formed by divine teaching, we dare to say, Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed\n(1269.6, 1277.52)  be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily\n(1277.52, 1285.36)  bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us and lead us not into\n(1285.36, 1292.0)  temptation but deliver us from evil deliver us lord we pray from every evil graciously grant\n(1292.0, 1297.52)  peace in our days that by the help of your mercy we may be always free from sin and safe from all\n(1297.52, 1301.88)  distress as we await the blessed hope and the coming of our Savior Jesus\n(1301.88, 1310.8)  Christ Lord Jesus Christ who said to your apostles peace I leave you my peace\n(1310.8, 1315.16)  I give you look not in our sins but on the faith of your church and graciously\n(1315.16, 1318.64)  grant her peace and unity in accordance with your will who live and reign\n(1318.64, 1324.2)  forever and ever the peace of the Lord be with you always let us offer each\n(1324.2, 1332.0)  other the sign of peace. Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have\n(1332.0, 1338.0)  mercy on us. Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1338.0, 1344.68)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, grant us peace.\n(1354.2, 1365.76)  Behold the Lamb of God, behold him who takes away the sins of the world.\n(1365.76, 1368.16)  Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb.\n(1368.16, 1373.92)  Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof, but only say the word and my\n(1373.92, 1380.92)  my soul shall be healed.\n(1403.92, 1419.88)  The chalice that we will bless is a communion in the blood of Christ, and the bread that\n(1419.88, 1426.88)  we break is a sharing in the body of the Lord.\n(1568.88, 1575.88)  So, thank you very much.\n(1627.88, 1654.0)  Let us pray.\n(1657.88, 1661.6)  Refreshed, O Lord, by this saving food and drink,\n(1661.6, 1663.72)  we pray that we may always be bathed\n(1663.72, 1665.94)  in the blood of our Savior,\n(1665.94, 1668.4)  so that it may become for us a spring of water\n(1668.4, 1672.72)  welling up to eternal life through Christ our Lord.\n(1672.72, 1674.02)  The Lord be with you.\n(1675.02, 1676.76)  May almighty God bless you,\n(1676.76, 1680.4)  the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit.\n(1680.4, 1682.2)  Go forth, the mass is ended.\n(1684.48, 1682.2) \n(1690.16, 1696.04)  Saint Michael, the archangel, defend us in battle. Be our protection against the wickedness and snares of the devil. May God rebuke him, we humbly pray. And do thou, O the prince\n(1696.04, 1702.84)  of the heavenly hosts, by the power of God cast into hell Satan and all the evil spirits\n(1702.84, 1706.36)  who prowl about the world, seeking the ruin of souls. Amen.\n(1772.2, 1797.12)  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n",

        "transcript": "(270.0, 298.56)  Good morning, everyone.\n(298.56, 300.86)  I'm in one piece, thank God.\n(300.86, 303.5)  We ask the Lord to be with us this beautiful day,\n(303.5, 306.62)  asking God to strengthen us in our evangelization.\n(306.62, 308.9)  We're sent out to the vineyard to bring the good word\n(308.9, 311.58)  to God's people, as we do every day,\n(311.58, 313.7)  and certainly you come so faithfully\n(313.7, 315.72)  as laborers in the field of Christ.\n(315.72, 317.66)  In the name of the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit,\n(317.66, 318.98)  amen, the Lord be with you.\n(318.98, 319.94)  And with your spirit.\n(319.94, 322.22)  As we come to celebrate our liturgy this morning,\n(322.22, 324.7)  we ask the Lord for the forgiveness of our sins\n(324.7, 327.12)  as we prepare for these sacred mysteries.\n(327.12, 329.08)  Lord, have mercy.\n(329.08, 331.08)  Christ, have mercy.\n(331.08, 333.0)  Lord, have mercy.\n(333.0, 335.34)  May Almighty God have mercy on us.\n(335.34, 337.04)  May the Lord forgive us our sins\n(337.04, 339.8)  and bring us to everlasting life.\n(339.8, 341.0)  Let us pray.\n(341.0, 342.98)  O God, who showed the light of your truth\n(342.98, 345.0)  to those who go astray,\n(345.0, 347.96)  so that they may return to the right path,\n(347.96, 350.46)  give all who, for the faith of their provest,\n(350.46, 352.04)  are accounted as Christians,\n(352.04, 354.78)  the grace to reject whatever is contrary\n(354.78, 356.32)  to the name of Christ,\n(356.32, 359.56)  and to strive after all that does its honor.\n(359.56, 361.88)  Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\n(361.88, 363.8)  who lives and reigns with you in the unity\n(363.8, 368.64)  of the Holy Spirit, one God, forever and ever, amen.\n(368.64, 369.48)  Please be seated.\n(369.48, 371.88)  Let us now be attentive to God's sacred word.\n(381.54, 383.8)  A reading from the book of Genesis.\n(384.96, 383.8) \n(393.8, 396.8)  In the course of the night, Jacob arose, took his two wives with the two maidservants and his eleven children, and crossed the ford of the Jabbok.\n(396.8, 405.8)  After he had taken them across the stream and had brought over all his possessions, Jacob was left there alone.\n(405.8, 411.8)  Then some man wrestled with him until the break of dawn.\n(411.8, 420.16)  When the man saw that he could not prevail over him, he struck Jacob's hip at its socket,\n(420.16, 424.52)  so that the hip socket was wrenched as they wrestled.\n(424.52, 429.56)  The man then said, Let me go, for it is daybreak.\n(429.56, 435.1)  But Jacob said, I will not let you go until you bless me.\n(435.1, 438.44)  The man asked, What is your name?\n(438.44, 441.82)  He answered, Jacob.\n(441.82, 449.66)  Then the man said, You shall no longer be spoken of as Jacob, but as Israel, because\n(449.66, 456.42)  you have contended with divine and human beings and have prevailed.\n(456.42, 461.46)  Jacob then asked him, Do tell me your name, please.\n(461.46, 465.94)  He answered, Why should you want to know my name?\n(465.94, 470.12)  With that he bade him farewell.\n(470.12, 478.24)  Jacob named the place Peniel because I have seen God face to face, he said, yet my life\n(478.24, 482.14)  has been spared.\n(482.14, 488.76)  At sunrise, as he left Penuel, Jacob limped along because of his hip.\n(488.76, 494.8)  That is why to this day the children of Israel do not eat the sciatic muscle that is on the\n(494.8, 501.64)  hip socket, inasmuch as Jacob's hip socket was struck at the sciatic muscle.\n(501.64, 505.32)  The word of the Lord.\n(505.32, 512.16)  In justice I shall behold your face, O Lord.\n(512.16, 523.64)  Hear O Lord a just suit, attend to my outcry, harken to my prayer from lips without deceit.\n(523.64, 531.5)  From you let my judgment come, your eyes behold what is right, though you test my heart, searching\n(531.5, 541.52)  it in the night, though you try me with fire, you shall find no malice in me.\n(541.52, 549.2)  I call upon you for you will answer me, O God, incline your ear to me, hear my word,\n(549.2, 559.08)  Show your wondrous mercies, O Savior of those who flee from their foes.\n(559.08, 561.6)  Hide me in the shadow of your wings.\n(561.6, 565.8)  I, in justice, shall behold your face.\n(565.8, 569.8)  on waking, I shall be content in your presence.\n(591.8, 593.8)  Hallelujah, hallelujah.\n(593.8, 594.8)  Hallelujah, hallelujah.\n(594.8, 596.66)  I am the good shepherd, says the Lord.\n(596.76, 599.0)  I know my sheep, and mine know me.\n(599.1, 600.8)  Hallelujah, hallelujah.\n(600.9, 602.64)  The Lord be with you.\n(602.74, 607.7)  A reading from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew.\n(607.8, 611.44)  A demonic who could not speak was brought to Jesus.\n(611.54, 614.72)  And when the demon was driven out, the mute man spoke.\n(614.82, 617.92)  The crowds were amazed and said, nothing like this\n(618.02, 620.38)  has ever been seen in Israel.\n(620.48, 623.52)  But the Pharisees said, he drives out demons\n(623.62, 623.52) \n(625.58, 628.14)  by the prince of demons. Jesus went around to all the towns and villages,\n(628.14, 629.82)  teaching in their synagogues,\n(629.82, 632.48)  proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom,\n(632.48, 635.22)  and curing every disease and illness.\n(635.22, 636.5)  At the sight of the crowds,\n(636.5, 639.22)  his heart was moved with pity for them,\n(639.22, 641.74)  because they were troubled and abandoned,\n(641.74, 643.82)  like sheep without a shepherd.\n(643.82, 645.62)  Then he said to his disciples,\n(645.62, 649.86)  the harvest is abundant, but labor is a few,\n(649.86, 653.0)  so the master of the harvest.\n(653.0, 655.42)  So ask the master of the harvest\n(655.42, 658.08)  to send out laborers for the harvest.\n(658.08, 659.48)  The gospel of the Lord.\n(662.66, 666.12)  Well today it's really about you and myself\n(666.12, 670.36)  and others that we know that try to get to mass every day\n(670.36, 673.72)  or several times during the week and of course Sunday.\n(673.72, 676.12)  And that gift of the Eucharist encourages us\n(676.12, 678.52)  to be really laborers in the field.\n(678.52, 681.24)  I think that if you tell your family by now\n(681.24, 682.68)  They know your routine.\n(682.68, 684.56)  What did you do this morning, Mom or Dad\n(684.56, 688.08)  or Aunt Sarah or Kevin or it could be anyone?\n(688.08, 690.08)  Well, I had mass in the morning.\n(690.08, 693.96)  That image of saying I had mass in the morning,\n(693.96, 697.0)  that when they have difficulty in life,\n(697.0, 700.88)  they know who to call because they know you believe\n(700.88, 702.68)  and you're a witness to Christ.\n(702.68, 704.28)  And so that's an important thing\n(704.28, 705.46)  because you might be saying,\n(705.46, 707.88)  well, I'm not as active as I'd like to be.\n(707.88, 710.16)  Just by your presence in your faithfulness,\n(710.16, 714.48)  even on Sunday, today is an icon, a light,\n(714.48, 716.36)  that brings us great faith.\n(716.36, 718.6)  The gospel today talks about, friends,\n(718.6, 721.96)  today the Lord directs his disciples to ask the Father\n(721.96, 724.92)  to send laborers for the work of evangelization.\n(724.92, 727.76)  Now, evangelization means to break open the word of God,\n(727.76, 729.68)  to speak about God's love.\n(729.68, 732.96)  The Christian life is lived between these two imperatives,\n(732.96, 735.3)  conversion and mission.\n(735.3, 738.48)  Conversion is when we are really turned to Christ\n(738.48, 740.38)  and we know that we believe in him\n(740.38, 742.96)  and we want to speak and give witness to that,\n(742.96, 745.38)  and we do that by our everyday life.\n(745.38, 749.46)  And the mission is to take that and put it into practice.\n(749.46, 752.22)  Today, going to Boston College\n(753.06, 755.78)  in a program in spirituality for the last two years,\n(755.78, 757.94)  and I'll continue this year,\n(757.94, 762.5)  the director of youth ministry spoke to us in May\n(762.5, 767.42)  and said there were 37 different organizations on campus\n(767.42, 769.98)  where people get involved through witnessing\n(769.98, 773.98)  by doing works of charity and soup kitchens, you name it,\n(773.98, 777.02)  70%, that's a wonderful gift.\n(777.02, 780.82)  Now, when you ask how many of that 70% go to Mass on Sunday,\n(780.82, 782.58)  I'm not gonna tell you.\n(782.58, 784.9)  But the fact that their hearts have been touched\n(784.9, 788.18)  to do Christian service is so important.\n(788.18, 790.82)  It's the beginning in looking at Christ.\n(790.82, 793.92)  And that's what Christ is saying to us in the gospel.\n(793.92, 797.44)  To the best of your ability, give me your praise.\n(797.44, 800.84)  And when you can and when you hear Christ in your heart\n(800.84, 803.18)  that turns your heart, Christian service\n(803.18, 806.52)  makes you realize with your eyes, this is important.\n(806.52, 809.2)  Maybe it will bring me to another level of faith\n(809.2, 811.8)  to nurture that, and that's conversion.\n(811.8, 815.0)  So today we talk about mission and conversion,\n(815.0, 818.56)  and we thank you this morning for being here\n(818.56, 821.92)  in the works that you do without even realizing it.\n(821.92, 825.6)  In the silence of my heart, may I be your witness.\n(825.6, 827.98)  Let us stand now for a prayer of the faithful.\n(827.98, 830.04)  Loving God, summer days are few\n(830.04, 832.0)  and green fields have turned to gold.\n(832.0, 833.98)  The time is here for the harvesting.\n(833.98, 836.5)  Loving God, make us members of your church\n(836.5, 839.98)  that bring Christ to others, we pray to the Lord.\n(839.98, 842.62)  For our neighbors in this community in need of prayers,\n(842.62, 846.52)  may God abide them with mercy and love, we pray to the Lord.\n(847.52, 850.12)  For those who have died, may they be raised to heaven\n(850.12, 853.44)  and accompany the angels and saints, we pray to the Lord.\n(854.28, 856.84)  For those who struggle to forgive themselves,\n(856.84, 860.44)  may God's healing grace comfort them, we pray to the Lord.\n(861.36, 864.46)  And for you and I, for those who are witnesses to us,\n(864.46, 867.24)  we have our faith because someone in our life\n(867.24, 869.0)  gave us that example of faith,\n(869.0, 872.2)  and thanksgiving for those people, we pray to the Lord.\n(873.06, 875.46)  Loving God, we open our hearts to your love this day,\n(875.46, 878.98)  offering our prayers through Christ our Lord, amen.\n(878.98, 879.82)  Let us celebrate.\n(880.12, 908.12)  We offer a master's day from Botley Keene.\n(938.12, 964.12)  Pray, my brothers and sisters, that this sacrifice may be acceptable to God the Almighty Father.\n(964.12, 967.58)  May the Lord accept the sacrifice at your hands.\n(967.58, 969.5)  Pray this in the order of His name,\n(969.5, 971.84)  and forever and ever.\n(971.84, 974.84)  Look upon our offerings to the Church, O Lord,\n(974.84, 976.6)  as she makes her prayer to you.\n(976.6, 979.84)  And grant that when consumed by those who believe,\n(979.84, 983.48)  may they bring everlasting holiness to us\n(983.48, 985.64)  through Christ our Lord.\n(985.64, 988.2)  My friends, the Lord be with you.\n(988.2, 990.3)  Lift up your hearts.\n(990.3, 992.84)  Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.\n(994.08, 992.84) \n(999.16, 1004.48)  It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, always and everywhere to give you thanks, Father most holy, through your beloved Son, Jesus Christ, your Word through whom\n(1004.48, 1009.38)  you made all things, whom you sent as our Savior and Redeemer, incarnate by the Holy\n(1009.38, 1011.88)  Spirit and born of the Virgin.\n(1011.88, 1016.4)  Fulfilling your will and gaining to your holy people, he stretched out his hands as he enjoyed\n(1016.4, 1020.68)  his passion so to break the bonds of death and manifest the resurrection.\n(1020.68, 1026.12)  And so, with all the angels and all the saints, we declare Your glory, as with one voice we\n(1026.12, 1027.12)  acclaim.\n(1027.12, 1034.08)  Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts, heaven and earth are full of Your glory, Hosanna\n(1034.08, 1035.08)  in the highest.\n(1035.08, 1041.26)  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, Hosanna in the highest.\n(1041.26, 1044.7)  You are indeed holy, O Lord, the fount of all holiness.\n(1044.7, 1049.82)  Make holy these gifts, we pray, by sending down Your Spirit upon them like the dewfall,\n(1049.82, 1056.02)  that they may become for us the body and blood of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.\n(1056.02, 1061.1)  At the time he was betrayed and entered willingly into his passion, he took bread and, giving\n(1061.1, 1064.46)  thanks, broke it, gave it to his disciples, saying,\n(1064.46, 1070.46)  Take this, all of you, and eat of it, that this is my body, which will be given up for you.\n(1078.46, 1070.46) \n(1081.82, 1086.58)  In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took the chalice. Once more giving thanks, he gave it to his disciples, saying take this, all of you, and\n(1086.58, 1087.58)  drink from it.\n(1087.58, 1092.74)  For this is the chalice of my blood, the blood of the new and eternal covenant, which will\n(1092.74, 1097.66)  be poured out for you and for many, for the forgiveness of sins.\n(1097.66, 1109.5)  Do this in memory of me.\n(1109.5, 1111.02)  The mystery of faith.\n(1111.02, 1116.86)  We proclaim your death, O Lord, and profess your resurrection until you come again.\n(1116.86, 1122.14)  Therefore, as we celebrate the memorial of his death and resurrection, we offer you,\n(1122.14, 1126.94)  Lord, the bread of life and the chalice of salvation, giving thanks that you held\n(1126.94, 1133.26)  us worthy to be in your presence and minister to you. Humbly we pray that\n(1133.26, 1138.86)  partaking of the body and blood of Christ we may be gathered into one by the\n(1138.86, 1144.06)  Holy Spirit. Remember Lord your church spread throughout the world. Bring her to\n(1144.06, 1148.5)  the fullest of charity together with Leo our Pope, Richard our Bishop and all the\n(1148.5, 1155.04)  Today, in prayer, let us remember our brother in Christ bodily this day, whom you call from\n(1155.04, 1160.24)  this world to yourself, grant that he who is united with your son in a death like his\n(1160.24, 1164.18)  may also be one with him in his resurrection.\n(1164.18, 1169.2)  Remember also our brothers and sisters who have fallen asleep in the hope of the resurrection\n(1169.2, 1172.08)  and all who have died in your mercy.\n(1172.08, 1174.28)  Welcome them into the light of your face.\n(1174.28, 1179.72)  Have mercy on us all, we pray, with the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God, with the Blessed\n(1179.72, 1185.4)  Apostles and all of the saints who have pleased you throughout the ages, St. Augustine, St.\n(1185.4, 1191.16)  Brigid, Gate of Heaven, may we merit to be coheirs to eternal life and praise and glorify\n(1191.16, 1195.64)  you through your Son, Jesus Christ.\n(1195.64, 1200.4)  For it is through him with and in him, O God Almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy\n(1200.4, 1207.4)  Holy Spirit, all glory and honor is Yours, forever and ever. Amen.\n(1208.9, 1213.9)  At the Savior's command, informed by divine teaching, we dare to say,\n(1213.9, 1218.4)  Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name.\n(1218.4, 1223.4)  Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.\n(1223.4, 1227.9)  Give us this day our dearly bred, and forgive us our trespasses,\n(1227.9, 1235.34)  as we forgive those who trespass against us and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.\n(1235.34, 1241.5)  Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil. Graciously grant peace in our days,\n(1241.5, 1247.9)  that by the help of your mercy we may be always free from sin, safe from all distress,\n(1248.54, 1254.38)  as we await the blessed hope and the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ.\n(1257.9, 1261.9)  Lord Jesus Christ, who said to your apostles,\n(1261.9, 1264.9)  Peace I leave you, might peace I give you.\n(1264.9, 1268.9)  Look not on our sins, but on the faith of your church,\n(1268.9, 1272.9)  and graciously grant her peace and unity in accordance with your will,\n(1272.9, 1275.9)  who live and reign forever and ever.\n(1275.9, 1278.9)  May the peace of Christ be with all of you.\n(1278.9, 1281.9)  Let us offer each other a sign of that peace.\n(1287.9, 1296.4)  The Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world. Have mercy on us.\n(1296.4, 1300.9)  The Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world. Have mercy on us.\n(1300.9, 1305.9)  The Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world. Grant us peace.\n(1305.9, 1312.9)  Behold the Lamb of God. Behold him who takes away the sins of the world.\n(1312.9, 1315.9)  How blessed are we who are called to the supper of the Lamb.\n(1315.9, 1322.9)  Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter into my group, but only say the word and my soul shall be healed.\n(1322.9, 1325.9)  May the body and blood of Christ keep us safe for eternal life.\n(1345.9, 1374.5)  The fields are high and summer's days are few, green fields have turned to gold.\n(1374.5, 1382.34)  The time is here for the harvesting,\n(1382.34, 1390.5)  for gathering, holding to barns.\n(1390.5, 1398.82)  The harvest is plenty, labor as a few.\n(1398.82, 1406.3)  Come with me into the fields.\n(1406.3, 1414.78)  Your arms may grow weary, your shoes will wear thin.\n(1414.78, 1419.28)  Come with me into the fields.\n(1428.82, 1454.06)  The seeds they were sown by other hands than yours nurture and cared for they grow.\n(1454.06, 1461.82)  But those who have sown will not harvest them.\n(1461.82, 1469.82)  The reaping will not be their care.\n(1469.82, 1478.3)  The harvest is plenty, laborers of you.\n(1478.3, 1485.78)  Come with me into the fields.\n(1485.78, 1489.76)  Your arms may grow weary.\n(1489.76, 1494.26)  Your shoes will wear thin.\n(1494.26, 1498.76)  Come with me into the fields.\n(1508.3, 1533.3)  The eyes have seen the holy face of love hidden from those who are wise.\n(1533.3, 1541.28)  The rain of God is within your heart.\n(1541.28, 1549.76)  The kingdom of heaven is near.\n(1549.76, 1558.24)  The harvest is plenty when the lads are few.\n(1558.24, 1565.94)  Come with me into the fields.\n(1565.94, 1574.34)  Your arms they grow weary, your shoes will wear thin.\n(1574.34, 1582.54)  Come with me into the fields.\n(1582.54, 1590.38)  Come with me into the fields\n(1612.54, 1624.14)  Let us pray.\n(1624.14, 1629.38)  Having consumed these gifts, we pray, O Lord, that by our participation in this mystery,\n(1629.38, 1631.7)  its saving effects upon us may grow.\n(1631.7, 1633.1)  Through Christ our Lord.\n(1633.1, 1637.54)  The Lord be with you as we bow our heads and pray for God's blessings.\n(1637.54, 1639.02)  May the Lord bless you and keep you.\n(1639.02, 1643.26)  May his face shine upon you and be gracious to you, blessing you in the name of the Father,\n(1643.26, 1645.26)  the Son, and the Holy Spirit.\n(1645.26, 1646.26)  Amen.\n(1646.26, 1647.26)  Our celebration has ended.\n(1647.26, 1649.26)  Let us go in the peace of Christ.\n(1649.26, 1650.66)  Thanks be to God.\n(1650.66, 1653.62)  The ending today was much better than it was last week.\n(1653.62, 1655.98)  Thank you for assisting me at the altar.\n(1655.98, 1656.98)  Amen.\n(1656.98, 1657.58)  Have a great day.\n",

In your prayers today we'd ask you to remember Donny\n(214.6, 220.76)  Higgins for whom this Mass is offered. In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,\n(221.64, 227.16)  the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the communion of the Holy Spirit be\n(227.16, 233.48)  with all of you. Preparing ourselves for the Eucharist today, we call to mind God's love\n(233.48, 240.78)  and ask his mercy and his forgiveness you were sent to heal the contrite of\n(240.78, 249.38)  heart Lord have mercy you came to call sinners Christ have mercy you are seated\n(249.38, 255.38)  at the right hand of the Father to intercede for us Lord have mercy may\n(255.38, 260.58)  Almighty God have mercy on us forgive us our sins and bring us to everlasting\n(260.58, 269.96)  life. Let us pray. Oh God, who in the abasement of your Son have raised up a\n(269.96, 276.32)  fallen world, fill your faithful with holy joy, for on those you have rescued\n(276.32, 282.68)  from slavery to sin, you bestow eternal gladness through our Lord Jesus Christ,\n(282.68, 287.12)  your Son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God\n(287.12, 290.5)  forever and ever.\n(304.3, 309.74)  A reading from the book of Genesis. Abraham was a hundred years old when his\n(309.74, 315.06)  son Isaac was born to him. Isaac grew when on the day of the child's weaning\n(315.06, 321.5)  Abraham held a great feast Sarah noticed the son whom Hagar the Egyptian had born\n(321.5, 327.98)  to Abraham playing with her son Isaac so she demanded of Abraham drive out that\n(327.98, 333.74)  slave in her son no son of that slave is going to share the inheritance with my\n(333.74, 339.66)  son Isaac Abraham was greatly distressed especially on account of his son Ishmael\n(339.66, 345.08)  but God said to Abraham do not be distressed about the boy or about your\n(345.08, 351.48)  slave woman heed the demands of Sarah no matter what she is asking of you for is\n(351.48, 356.36)  through Isaac that descendants shall bear your name as for the son of the\n(356.36, 361.68)  slave woman I will make a great nation of him also since he too is your\n(361.68, 367.4)  offspring early the next morning Abraham got some bread and a skin of water and\n(367.4, 374.4)  gave them to Hagar. Then placing the child on her back, he sent her away. As she roamed\n(374.4, 380.74)  aimlessly in the wilderness of Beersheba, the water and the skin was used up. So she\n(380.74, 386.04)  put the child down under a shrub and then went and sat down opposite him about a bow\n(386.04, 392.96)  shot away. For she said to herself, let me not watch to see the child die. As she sat\n(392.96, 399.28)  opposite Ishmael he began to cry. God heard the boys cry and God's messenger\n(399.28, 404.84)  called to Hagar from heaven. What is the matter Hagar? Don't be afraid God has\n(404.84, 411.72)  heard the boys cry in this plight of his. Arise, lift up the boy and hold him by\n(411.72, 417.66)  the hand for I will make of him a great nation. Then God opened her eyes and she\n(417.66, 422.8)  saw a well of water. She went and filled the skin with water and then let the boy\n(422.8, 430.1)  drink. God was with the boy as he grew up. This is the word of the Lord.\n(430.1, 439.24)  Responsorial Psalm, the Lord hears the cry of the poor. When the poor one called\n(439.24, 445.26)  out the Lord heard and from all his distress he saved him. The angel of the\n(445.26, 453.62)  Lord and camps around those who fear him and delivers them. Fear the Lord, you holy\n(453.62, 458.26)  ones, for not as lacking to those who fear him. The great grow poor and hungry,\n(458.26, 468.26)  but those who seek the Lord want for no good thing. Come, children, hear me. I will\n(468.26, 473.46)  teach you the fear of the Lord. Which of you desires life and takes delight in\n(473.46, 499.42)  and prosperous days.\n(499.42, 502.06)  The Lord be with you.\n(502.06, 510.18)  reading from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew. When Jesus came to the\n(510.18, 516.9)  territory of Gadarenes, two demon acts were coming from the tomb and\n(516.9, 523.66)  met him. They were so savage that no one could travel by that road. They cried out,\n(523.66, 530.26)  What have you done to us, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the\n(530.26, 532.86)  appointed time.\n(532.86, 537.46)  Some distance away a herd of many swine was feeding.\n(537.46, 544.22)  The demons pleaded with him, if you drive us out, send us into the herd of swine.\n(544.22, 547.34)  And he said to them, go then.\n(547.34, 552.3)  They came out and entered the swine and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into\n(552.3, 555.7)  the sea where they drowned.\n(555.7, 562.54)  The swineherds ran away, and when they came to the town, they reported everything, including\n(562.54, 565.42)  what had happened to the demons.\n(565.42, 570.5)  Thereupon the whole town came out to meet Jesus, and when they saw him, they begged\n(570.5, 573.18)  him to leave their district.\n(573.18, 581.9)  The Gospel of the Lord.\n(581.9, 590.42)  and uncertainty and jealousy, these are emotions that really can gnaw at us and interfere with\n(590.42, 597.94)  our ability to understand what God is asking of us or how He is working in us and around\n(597.94, 599.58)  our life.\n(599.58, 607.14)  We and others can suffer as a result of those things like fear and jealousy.\n(607.14, 616.02)  The Eucharist we have to celebrate today hopefully fills us with that hope that God who loves\n(616.02, 621.4)  and cares for each of us will be our companion through those dark times of our lives when\n(621.4, 625.86)  we struggle with some of those issues in our life.\n(625.86, 631.0)  And we see in today's readings as we encounter people who are not quite sure that God brings\n(631.0, 633.94)  hope in troubled times.\n(633.94, 640.42)  First in that first reading we have Sarah, whose jealousy drives Hagar and Ishmael out\n(640.42, 646.14)  into the wilderness where they shall surely perish by themselves.\n(646.14, 653.92)  And that fact doesn't dissuade Sarah, for she is too concerned about her own son to\n(653.92, 660.74)  recognize as Abraham's only heir and sole beneficiary to the blessing bestowed upon\n(660.74, 662.44)  them by God.\n(662.44, 668.1)  God does not punish Sarah though, however, nor does he remove the blessings he promised\n(668.1, 669.6)  to her son.\n(669.6, 676.36)  Instead, we see God's blessing as an unlimited and truly abundant, while Sarah frets God,\n(676.36, 683.96)  hears the distress of Hagar and Ishmael, and sends a messenger to bring them comfort.\n(683.96, 689.36)  God is with them just as he is for Sarah and Abraham.\n(689.36, 695.54)  In the Gospel, we hear of Jesus caring for two people, driving demons out of them and\n(695.54, 698.3)  into the swine.\n(698.3, 703.98)  The demon pigs rush into the sea and perish.\n(703.98, 711.26)  Those whom Jesus freed from distress were not Jewish, but they were Gentile, and not\n(711.26, 717.9)  just that, they were the dirtiest of all Gentiles, working and caring for the swine, the dirtiest\n(717.9, 728.5)  of animals. It was forbidden for Jews to touch or consume. Yet Jesus had pity on them, loved\n(728.5, 735.28)  them and healed them because God's mercy is not bound by tribal affiliation like it was\n(735.28, 742.64)  back in those days or royal energy. God's mercy and care is for all of us. So these\n(742.64, 750.16)  These two stories, the Gospel and the first reading, teach us, I think, about God and\n(750.16, 752.6)  how he deals with us.\n(752.6, 761.7)  Even in our darkest moments, when we sin, when we are fearful, jealous, or don't care\n(761.7, 768.2)  for others the way we should, Jesus is always there for us.\n(768.2, 774.5)  Remember the word at Christmas time, Immanuel, God is with us.\n(774.5, 780.06)  God is always with us in the good times and in the bad times.\n(780.06, 784.38)  And God's mercy and care is always there for us.\n(784.38, 789.86)  So as we celebrate this Eucharist and receive the body of Christ this morning, may the Eucharist\n(789.86, 795.74)  we are about to receive fill us with the grace to know that God watches over all\n(795.74, 806.78)  of us. Let us pray. We now offer our prayers to God for the church and for\n(806.78, 811.34)  the world and we pray for the church throughout the world. May the Holy Spirit\n(811.34, 819.38)  help us recognize one another as the body of Christ. We pray to the Lord. For\n(819.38, 824.26)  civic leaders, may the Holy Spirit open their eyes to truth and justice, we pray\n(824.26, 832.34)  to the Lord. For all who suffered discord in families or communities, may God\n(832.34, 840.22)  reconcile them to one another, we pray to the Lord.

Abraham\n(445.8, 453.36)  was greatly distressed, especially on account of his son Ishmael. But God\n(453.36, 460.36)  said to Abraham, do not be distressed about the boy or about your slave woman.\n(460.36, 466.8)  Heed the demands of Sarah, no matter what she is asking of you, for it is through\n(466.8, 474.2)  True Isaac, that descendants shall bear your name, as for the son of the slave woman, I\n(474.2, 481.56)  will make a great nation of him also, since he too is your offspring.\n(481.56, 489.8)  Early the next morning, Abraham got some bread and a skin of water and gave them to Hagar.\n(489.8, 495.4)  Then placing the child on her back, he sent her away.\n(495.4, 502.36)  As she roamed aimlessly in the wilderness of Beersheba, the water in the skin was used\n(502.36, 504.0)  up.\n(504.0, 510.68)  So she put the child down under a shrub and then went and sat down opposite him about\n(510.68, 513.04)  a bow shot away.\n(513.04, 519.22)  For she said to herself, let me not watch to see the child die.\n(519.22, 524.68)  As she sat opposite Ishmael, he began to cry.\n(524.68, 531.22)  God heard the boys cry, and God's messenger called to Hagar from heaven.\n(531.22, 533.48)  What is the matter, Hagar?\n(533.48, 535.4)  Don't be afraid.\n(535.4, 539.4)  God has heard the boys cry in this plight of his.\n(539.4, 548.24)  Arise, lift up the boy and hold him by the hand, for I will make of him a great nation.\n(548.24, 553.64)  Then God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water.\n(553.64, 559.42)  She went and filled the skin with water and then let the boy drink.\n(559.42, 562.78)  God was with the boy as he grew up.\n(562.78, 563.78)  The word of the Lord.\n(563.78, 567.08)  Thanks be to God.\n(567.08, 569.64)  The Responsorial Psalm.\n(569.64, 572.8)  The Lord hears the cry of the poor.\n(572.8, 575.84)  The Lord hears the cry of the poor.\n(575.84, 583.0)  When the poor one called out, the Lord heard, and from all his distress he saved him.\n(583.0, 589.3)  The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear Him and delivers them.\n(589.3, 599.1)  Fear the Lord, you His holy ones, for naught is lacking to those who fear Him.\n(599.1, 609.56)  The great, broke, poor, and hungry, but those who seek the Lord want for no good thing.\n(609.56, 611.68)  Come children, hear me.\n(611.68, 619.72)  I will teach you the fear of the Lord, which of you desires life and takes delight in prosperous\n(619.72, 620.72)  God's peace.\n(620.72, 621.72)  Alleluia.\n(621.72, 622.72)  Alleluia.\n(622.72, 623.72)  Alleluia.\n(623.72, 624.72)  Alleluia.\n(624.72, 625.72)  Alleluia.\n(625.72, 626.72)  Alleluia.\n(626.72, 627.72)

 that we may be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.\n(672.16, 678.96)  Alleluia, Alleluia.\n(678.96, 681.64)  The Lord be with you.\n(681.64, 687.32)  A reading from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew.\n(687.32, 692.36)  When Jesus came to the territory of the Gadarenes,\n(692.36, 697.36)  two demoniacs who were coming from the tombs met him.\n(697.36, 701.92)  They were so savage that no one could travel by that road.\n(701.92, 706.3)  They cried out, what have you to do with us, Son of God?\n(706.3, 708.52)  Have you come here to torment us\n(708.52, 711.36)  before the appointed time?\n(711.36, 716.36)  Some distance away a herd of many swine was feeding.\n(716.9, 719.06)  The demons pleaded with him.\n(719.06, 724.06)  If you drive us out, send us into the herd of swine.\n(724.52, 727.32)  And he said to them, go then.\n(727.32, 729.6)  They came out and entered the swine\n(729.6, 734.0)  and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank\n(734.0, 736.64)  into the sea where they drowned.\n(737.72, 741.76)  The swineheads ran away, and when they came to the town,\n(741.76, 743.76)  they reported everything,\n(743.76, 747.2)  including what had happened to the demoniacs.\n(747.2, 752.2)  Thereupon, the whole town came out to meet Jesus,\n(753.18, 756.4)  and when they saw him, they begged him\n(756.4, 758.6)  to leave their district.\n(758.6, 761.46)  the Gospel of the Lord.\n(765.5, 767.32)  In the psalm response today,\n(767.32, 772.32)  we prayed the words the Lord hears the cry of the poor.\n(774.88, 777.88)  And how fortunate it is.\n(777.88, 782.32)  All of us are poor in the eyes of God.\n(782.32, 787.32)  We're trying hard to live in accordance with his mandates,\n(787.84, 787.32) \n(792.32, 794.32)  mandates his direction and his help. We're not always successful,\n(794.32, 798.32)  but as long as we're trying to do this,\n(798.32, 804.32)  follow Jesus in all the aspects of our life,\n(804.32, 807.32)  we're making progress.\n(807.32, 811.32)  And he, who is the just judge of us all,\n(811.32, 815.32)  will reward us for the efforts we make.\n(815.32, 820.24)  We should never forget that he does hear indeed\n(820.24, 824.64)  the cries of the poor, the cries of all of us.\n(825.6, 827.84)  And so with confidence in him,\n(827.84, 831.28)  we turn to him so often in asking his help\n(832.16, 835.4)  and guiding us and drawing us closer to himself\n(837.04, 841.4)  as we travel along this journey that we call life.\n(841.4, 846.4)  how grateful we should be that he is indeed\n(846.82, 851.02)  listening to the cries of all of us.\n(851.02, 853.3)  We pray today for our deceased loved ones,\n(853.3, 856.22)  our benefactors, relatives, and friends.\n(856.22, 857.58)  For those who've been good to us\n(857.58, 860.18)  and good to our parish through the years,\n(860.18, 862.22)  let us pray to the Lord.\n(863.7, 866.02)  We pray especially for our parishioners,\n(866.02, 868.1)  all those who have gone to be with God,\n(868.1, 870.18)  and those who are living still,\n(870.18, 872.84)  for whom this Mass is being offered,\n(872.84, 874.76)  let us pray to the Lord.\n(876.94, 881.4)  For the repose of the soul of a very popular priest\n(881.4, 886.4)  who served in this parish in retirement,\n(888.36, 892.24)  or at least close to retirement, Father Daniel Sheehan.\n(892.24, 897.24)  Today is the 14th anniversary of his death.\n(899.0, 897.24) \n(904.28, 906.28)  And we pray for the repose of the soul of Father Daniel Sheehan, let us pray to the Lord.\n(906.28, 910.64)  For those who have asked us to pray for them, and those who have no one else to pray for\n(910.64, 915.76)  them except us, let us pray to the Lord.\n(915.76, 921.96)  For peace in the world and all these troubled places about which we hear so much, that God\n(921.96, 928.96)  will bring about peace all over the world. Let us pray to the Lord. For our own particular\n(930.02, 937.02)  intentions today that we kept quietly in our hearts, let us pray to the Lord. Oh God, we\n(939.24, 944.78)  ask you to hear our petitions and requests today and to grant them if it is your will.\n(944.78, 951.78)  We ask all these things through Jesus Christ our Lord.\n(981.96, 988.96)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through your goodness we have received\n(992.6, 999.24)  the bread we offer you. Fruit of the earth and work of human hands, it will become for\n(999.24, 1006.24)  us the bread of life. By the mystery of this water and wine may we come to share in the\n(1007.6, 1006.24) \n(1013.24, 1022.84)  may we come to share in the divinity of Christ, who humbled Himself to share in our humanity.\n(1028.52, 1035.52)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through your goodness we have received the wine we offer you, fruit of the vine and work of human hands, it will become our spiritual\n(1036.24, 1043.24)  drink. With humble spirit and contrite heart, may we be accepted by you, O Lord, and may\n(1046.34, 1053.34)  our sacrifice and your sight this day be pleasing to you, Lord God. Wash me, O Lord, from my\n(1054.3, 1061.3)  iniquity and cleanse me from my sin.\n(1066.24, 1085.24)  Pray, brothers and sisters, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God, the Almighty\n(1085.24, 1086.24)  Father.\n(1086.24, 1105.28)  O God, who graciously accomplished the effects of your mysteries, grant, we pray, that the\n(1105.28, 1112.8)  needs by which we serve you may be worthy of these sacred gifts through Christ our Lord.\n(1112.8, 1115.24)  The Lord be with you.\n(1115.24, 1117.8)  Lift up your heart.\n(1117.8, 1122.64)  Let us give thanks to the Lord, our God.\n(1122.64, 1126.2)  It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,\n(1126.2, 1129.76)  always and everywhere to give you thanks,\n(1129.76, 1134.08)  Lord, Holy Father, almighty and eternal God.\n(1134.08, 1137.36)  For although you have no need of our praise,\n(1137.36, 1141.36)  yet our thanksgiving is itself your gift.\n(1141.36, 1149.36)  Since our praises add nothing to Your greatness, but profit us for salvation through Christ our Lord.\n(1149.36, 1156.36)  And so, in company with the choirs of angels, we praise You, and with joy we proclaim,\n(1156.36, 1163.36)  Holy, holy, holy Lord God of hosts, heaven and earth are full of Your glory.\n(1163.36, 1169.36)  Hosanna in the highest, blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.\n(1169.36, 1179.36)  You are indeed holy, O Lord, the fount of all holiness.\n(1179.36, 1186.36)  Make holy, therefore, these gifts, we pray, by sending down your Spirit upon them like the dewfall,\n(1186.36, 1194.36)  so that they may become for us the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.\n(1194.36, 1198.36)  At the time he was betrayed and entered willingly into his passion,\n(1198.36, 1204.36)  He took bread, and giving thanks, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying,\n(1204.36, 1214.36)  Take this, all of you, and eat of it, for this is my body, which will be given up for you.\n(1228.36, 1236.5)  In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took the chalice, and once more, giving thanks,\n(1236.5, 1243.64)  he gave it to his disciples, saying, Take this, all of you, and drink from it, for this\n(1243.64, 1250.54)  is the chalice of my blood, the blood of the new and eternal covenant, which will be poured\n(1250.54, 1275.06)  out for you, and for many, for the forgiveness of sins. Do this in memory of me.\n(1275.06, 1282.06)  the mystery of faith. Save us, Savior of the world, for by your cross and resurrection\n(1283.78, 1290.4)  you have set us free. Therefore, as we celebrate the memorial of his death and resurrection,\n(1290.4, 1296.1)  we offer you, Lord, the bread of life and the chalice of salvation, giving thanks that\n(1296.1, 1303.1)  you have held us worthy to be in your presence and minister to you. Humbly we pray that partaking\n(1304.7, 1303.1) \n(1308.06, 1314.5)  pray that partaking of the body and blood of Christ we may be gathered into one by the Holy Spirit. Remember, Lord, your church spread throughout the world\n(1314.5, 1320.54)  and bring it to the fullness of charity together with Leo, our\n(1320.54, 1332.9)  Pope, and Richard, our Bishop, and all the clergy. Remember all your servant, he\n(1332.9, 1339.8)  people from this parish whom you have called of this world to yourself, granted they who\n(1339.8, 1346.8)  were united with your son in the death like his may also be one with him in his resurrection.\n(1348.44, 1354.92)  Remember also our brothers and sisters who have fallen asleep in the hope of the resurrection\n(1354.92, 1361.92)  and all who have died in your mercy, welcome them into the light of your face. Have mercy\n(1362.16, 1361.92) \n(1368.92, 1374.44)  on us all. We pray that with the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God, with Blessed Joseph her spouse, with the Blessed Apostles and all the saints who have pleased you throughout\n(1374.44, 1381.44)  the ages, we may merit to be coheirs to eternal life and may praise and glorify you through\n(1381.52, 1388.52)  your Son, Jesus Christ. Through him and with him and in him, O God Almighty Father, we\n(1391.92, 1401.92)  In the unity of the Holy Spirit, all glory and honor is Yours, forever and ever.\n(1401.92, 1406.92)  At the Savior's command, informed by divine teaching, we dare to say,\n(1406.92, 1411.92)  Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name.\n(1411.92, 1416.92)  Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.\n(1416.92, 1424.38)  Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who\n(1424.38, 1431.64)  trespass against us, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.\n(1431.64, 1436.96)  Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil.\n(1436.96, 1442.88)  Graciously grant peace in our days, that by the help of your mercy we may be always free\n(1442.88, 1449.88)  from sin and safe from all distress as we await the blessed hope and the coming of our\n(1450.24, 1454.24)  Savior, Jesus Christ.\n(1454.24, 1460.24)  Lord Jesus Christ, who said to your apostles,\n(1460.24, 1467.24)  peace I leave you, my peace I give you, look not on our sins but on the faith of your church\n(1468.44, 1467.24) \n(1471.68, 1473.82)  your church, and graciously grant her peace and unity in accordance with your will,\n(1473.82, 1476.56)  who live and reign forever and ever.\n(1477.4, 1480.86)  The peace of the Lord be with you always.\n(1482.24, 1485.2)  Let us offer each other some sign of peace.\n(1496.54, 1485.2) \n(1502.04, 1507.64)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us. Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1507.64, 1514.36)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, grant us peace.\n(1514.36, 1521.36)  mindful of the people who are with us through the streaming system. They are not able to\n(1524.64, 1531.64)  be here present in the church. They are located all over the world. We have no idea how many\n(1532.76, 1539.76)  of them are with us in Union as we celebrate this Eucharist. We are asked by the church\n(1542.68, 1539.76) \n(1543.62, 1546.36)  We are asked by the church to make sure that they have an opportunity to receive a,\n(1547.28, 1550.2)  make a spiritual act of Holy Communion\n(1550.2, 1552.8)  since they're not able to receive in their homes\n(1552.8, 1555.02)  as we do here in the church.\n(1555.02, 1559.82)  And so we pray together for them and for ourselves,\n(1559.82, 1563.1)  Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the living God,\n(1563.1, 1564.62)  who by the will of the Father\n(1564.62, 1567.18)  and the work of the Holy Spirit,\n(1567.18, 1569.94)  Through your death gave life to the world.\n(1569.94, 1572.94)  Free us by this, your most holy body and blood,\n(1572.94, 1576.9)  from all our sins and from every evil.\n(1576.9, 1580.74)  Keep us always faithful to your commandments,\n(1580.74, 1586.5)  and never let us be parted from you.\n(1586.5, 1589.42)  Behold the Lamb of God.\n(1589.42, 1593.58)  Behold him who takes away the sins of the world.\n(1593.58, 1598.34)  Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb.\n(1598.34, 1602.42)  Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof,\n(1602.42, 1606.42)  but only say the word and my soul shall be healed.\n(1653.58, 1669.58)  The communion verse for today bless the Lord over my soul and all within me his holy name.\n(1683.58, 1687.58)  And the body of Christ.\n(1713.58, 1734.58)  The body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body\n(1734.58, 1742.58)  of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ,\n(1742.58, 1745.56)  The body is high, sister.\n(1745.56, 1749.56)  The body is high, sweetie.\n(1749.56, 1753.56)  The body is high, sweetie.\n(1753.56, 1756.56)  The body is high, sweetie.\n(1756.56, 1760.54)  The body is high, sweetie.\n(1760.54, 1762.54)  The body is high, sweetie.\n(1861.58, 1873.58)  We ask you to remember the priests at Virginia Cleary, as we always do.\n(1873.58, 1884.58)  As we've said so often before, we are the ones who have served the church in Boston, the Archdiocese of Boston for so many years,\n(1884.58, 1890.58)  and there are many of us there who have no one else to pray for them except us.\n(1890.58, 1899.58)  the people of God like herself, who have benefited from the many years of service of these priests,\n(1899.58, 1904.58)  and we ask you please not to forget them.\n(1904.58, 1910.58)  We have a special guest with us today who has just celebrated Mass with us here,\n(1910.58, 1919.58)  sitting in the congregation, Monsignor Leonard Danvers, who is a close friend of mine for many years.\n(1919.58, 1926.58)  He came to Boston from as far away, as far as you can go, actually, on New Zealand.\n(1926.58, 1932.58)  He studied at Boston College 43 years ago, lived in the rectory where I was stationed.\n(1932.58, 1936.58)  We became great friends, and we've been back and forth, the two of us.\n(1936.58, 1944.58)  He, many times more, visiting Boston, and myself, many times, visiting in New Zealand.\n(1944.58, 1954.58)  He is the retired pastor of the parish of Cambridge in the diocese of Hamilton, New Zealand.\n(1954.58, 1965.58)  He is the vicar general of that diocese, which means that he is the first assistant and stands in for the bishop of the diocese when necessary.\n(1965.58, 1975.58)  and he has come to spend a month at Regina Clary with me and my brother and the priests who live there.\n(1975.58, 1982.58)  I'm happy to have him with us today and I ask you to pray for him and for the church in New Zealand,\n(1982.58, 1990.58)  of which he is such a prominent and loving servant.\n(1990.58, 1993.58)  Thank you for coming to pray with us today.\n(1993.58, 1998.22)  I hope you have a good and a safe and a happy day.\n(1998.22, 2001.94)  Let us pray.\n(2001.94, 2008.18)  May this divine sacrifice we have offered and received fill us with life, O Lord, we\n(2008.18, 2016.18)  pray, so that bound to you in lasting charity, we may bear fruit that lasts forever through\n(2016.18, 2019.26)  Christ our Lord.\n(2019.26, 2029.98)  May the Lord be with you.\n(2029.98, 2032.86)  May the Lord bless you and keep you.\n(2032.86, 2037.78)  May He let His face shine upon you and show you His mercy.\n(2037.78, 2042.26)  May He turn His countenance towards you and give you His peace.\n(2042.26, 2043.7)  the blessing of almighty God.\n",

        "transcript": "(90.0, 97.0)  So, thank you very much for joining us today, and we'll see you in the next session.\n(269.0, 282.92)  Good morning, everyone.\n(282.92, 288.08)  In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, the grace of our Lord\n(288.08, 294.9)  Jesus Christ and the love of God and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with all of you.\n(294.9, 299.98)  As we prepare to celebrate this Eucharist today, we acknowledge our sins and so prepare\n(299.98, 306.26)  ourselves to celebrate the Sacred Mysteries.\n(306.26, 308.92)  You were sent to heal the contrite of heart.\n(308.92, 311.46)  Lord have mercy.\n(311.46, 313.1)  You came to call sinners.\n(313.1, 315.9)  Christ have mercy.\n(315.9, 320.58)  You are seated at the right hand of the Father to intercede for us.\n(320.58, 323.1)  Lord have mercy.\n(323.1, 329.98)  May Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us our sins, and bring us to everlasting life.\n(329.98, 331.98)  Let us pray.\n(331.98, 338.98)  O God, who show the light of your truth to those who go astray, so that they may return\n(338.98, 346.06)  to the right path, give all who for their faith they profess are accounted Christians\n(346.06, 352.2)  the grace to reject what is contrary to their name of Christ, and to strive after all that\n(352.2, 356.72)  does it honor through our Lord Jesus Christ your son who lives and reigns\n(356.72, 362.84)  with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit God forever and ever\n(374.64, 379.62)  reading from the book of Genesis when hunger came to be felt throughout the\n(379.62, 383.96)  land of Egypt, and the people cried to Pharaoh for bread.\n(383.96, 389.44)  Pharaoh directed all the Egyptians to go to Joseph and do whatever he told them.\n(389.44, 393.74)  When the famine had spread throughout the land, Joseph opened all the cities that had\n(393.74, 400.46)  grain and rationed it to the Egyptians, since the famine had gripped the land of Egypt.\n(400.46, 405.8)  In fact, all the world came to Joseph to obtain rations of grain, for famine had gripped the\n(405.8, 407.62)  whole world.\n(407.62, 412.46)  The sons of Israel were among those who came to procure rations.\n(412.46, 418.48)  It was Joseph, as governor of the country, who dispensed the rations to all the people.\n(418.48, 423.72)  When Joseph's brothers came and knelt down before him with their faces to the ground,\n(423.72, 426.78)  he recognized them as soon as he saw them.\n(426.78, 432.4)  But Joseph concealed his own identity from them and spoke sternly to them.\n(432.4, 437.72)  With that, he locked them up in the guard house for three days.\n(437.72, 443.92)  On the third day, Joseph said to his brothers, do this and you shall live, for I am a God-fearing\n(443.92, 445.18)  man.\n(445.18, 450.72)  If you have been honest, only one of your brothers needs to be confined in this prison,\n(450.72, 455.88)  while the rest of you may go and take home provisions for your starving families.\n(455.88, 459.64)  But you must come back to me with your youngest brother.\n(459.64, 463.46)  Your words will thus be verified, and you will not die.\n(463.46, 465.24)  To this they agreed.\n(465.24, 471.06)  To one another, however, they said, alas, we are being punished because of our brother.\n(471.06, 476.82)  We saw the anguish of his heart when he pleaded with us, yet we paid no heed.\n(476.82, 480.58)  That is why this anguish has now come upon us.\n(480.58, 481.58)  Reuben broke in.\n(481.58, 485.18)  Did I not tell you not to do wrong to the boy?\n(485.18, 487.14)  But you would not listen.\n(487.14, 490.08)  Now comes the reckoning for his blood.\n(490.08, 494.8)  The brothers did not know, of course, that Joseph understood what they said, since he\n(494.8, 497.82)  spoke with them through an interpreter.\n(497.82, 500.72)  But turning away from them, he wept.\n(500.72, 506.72)  The word of the Lord.\n(506.72, 517.9)  psalm, Lord let your mercy be on us as we place our trust in you. Give thanks to\n(517.9, 524.38)  the Lord on the harp with the ten string lyre, chant his praises, sing to him a new\n(524.38, 535.78)  song, pluck the strings skillfully with shouts of gladness, the Lord brings to\n(535.78, 541.06)  not the plans of nations he foils the designs of people but the plan of the\n(541.06, 552.1)  Lord stands forever the design of his heart through all generations but see\n(552.1, 557.18)  the eyes of the Lord are upon those who fear him upon those who hope for his\n(557.18, 564.18)  kindness to deliver them from death and preserve them in spite of famine\n(565.78, 590.74)  The Lord be with you.\n(590.74, 594.7)  A reading from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew.\n(594.7, 602.88)  Jesus summoned his 12 disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits to\n(602.88, 608.68)  drive them out and to cure every disease and every illness. The names of the 12\n(608.68, 615.82)  apostles are these. First Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew. James the\n(615.82, 621.76)  son of Zebedee and his brother John. Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas and\n(621.76, 628.88)  Matthew the tax collector, James the son of Alphaeus and Thaddeus, Simon the\n(628.88, 636.28)  Canaanan and Judas Iscariot who betrayed Jesus. Jesus sent out these twelve\n(636.28, 642.6)  after instructing them thus, do not go into pagan territory or enter a\n(642.6, 650.16)  Samaritan town, go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. As you go\n(650.16, 660.2)  make this proclamation. The kingdom of heaven is at hand. The Gospel of the Lord.\n(663.8, 669.56)  In today's Gospel, Jesus calls his 12 apostles and sends them out with a\n(669.56, 674.48)  mission to proclaim the kingdom of heaven is at hand. It's striking that\n(674.48, 680.18)  Jesus chooses very ordinary men, fishermen, tax collectors, even one who\n(680.18, 684.92)  would later betray him. He doesn't wait for them to be perfect, he equips them\n(684.92, 689.5)  with authority and sends them out just as they are to be messengers of his\n(689.5, 695.66)  kingdom. I think this reminds us that our mission too is not about being perfect\n(695.66, 702.46)  but rather being willing. Jesus still sends out his disciples today, he sends\n(702.46, 708.82)  us. Whether at home or at work or in our communities or even through those small\n(708.82, 715.26)  acts of kindness, each of us is called to witness to the nearness of God's kingdom\n(715.26, 721.22)  here on earth. Notice also that Jesus tells them to begin with the lost sheep\n(721.22, 727.06)  of the house of Israel. In other words, begin where you're at, begin where you\n(727.06, 732.94)  are here right now begin where you are in your homes and your families in your\n(732.94, 739.78)  workplace among your own people your own circle of friends evangelization doesn't\n(739.78, 745.92)  always mean going far away or standing on the corner on a soapbox preaching the\n(745.92, 753.34)  good news it often begins with loving those closest to us so maybe we can ask\n(753.34, 759.22)  the Lord today for the grace to be faithful to our mission not necessarily\n(759.22, 765.58)  to do great things but to bring the good news to those around us one person at a\n(765.58, 773.86)  time the kingdom of God is at hand may our lives be a sign that this is true\n(773.86, 783.26)  let us pray and with faith that God desires only our good we come to him\n(783.26, 787.86)  with our prayers and petitions and we pray for the church may God help us\n(787.86, 795.42)  remain faithful to his commands we pray to the Lord for leaders of nations may\n(795.42, 800.74)  the Holy Spirit guide them in working to protect all human life we pray to the\n(800.74, 807.58)  Lord for those who find it difficult to break with sinful habits may God guide\n(807.58, 814.62)  them and give them strength we pray to the Lord for our faith community may God\n(814.62, 821.3)  lead us in living our calling with generosity we pray to the Lord for all\n(821.3, 825.46)  the sick those in hospital or nursing home those undergoing surgery or\n(825.46, 830.2)  treatment today that God's healing presence may be with them we pray to the\n(830.2, 837.54)  Lord and for all who have died in Christ our parishioners family and friends may\n(837.54, 844.86)  they rest in his peace forever we pray to the Lord Heavenly Father we entrust\n(844.86, 852.06)  all these prayers into your loving hands and we ask them through Christ our Lord\n(867.54, 891.62)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through your goodness we have received\n(891.62, 895.78)  the bread we offer you, fruit of the earth and work of human hands.\n(895.78, 903.34)  will become for us the bread of life. Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through\n(903.34, 908.9)  your goodness we have received the wine we offer you, fruit of the vine and work of human\n(908.9, 913.62)  hands, it will become our spiritual drink.\n(926.94, 932.42)  Pray, brothers and sisters, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to\n(932.42, 935.78)  God the Almighty Father.\n(938.9, 948.54)  Look upon the offerings of your church, O Lord, as she makes her prayer to you, and\n(948.54, 954.56)  grant that when consumed by those who believe, they may bring ever greater holiness through\n(954.56, 956.98)  Christ our Lord.\n(956.98, 959.48)  The Lord be with you.\n(959.48, 962.62)  Lift up your hearts.\n(962.62, 966.8)  Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.\n(966.8, 972.24)  It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, always and everywhere to give you\n(972.24, 977.12)  thanks, Lord, Holy Father, Almighty and Eternal God.\n(977.12, 982.8)  For although you have no need of our praise, yet our thanksgiving is itself your gift,\n(982.8, 988.08)  since our praises add nothing to your greatness, but profit us for salvation through Christ\n(988.08, 989.5)  our Lord.\n(989.5, 996.4)  And so, in company with the choirs of angels, we praise you, and with joy we now proclaim.\n(996.4, 1004.0)  Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts, heaven and earth are full of your glory, Hosanna\n(1004.0, 1006.0)  in the highest.\n(1006.0, 1013.9)  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, Hosanna in the highest.\n(1013.9, 1017.44)  You are indeed holy, O Lord, the fount of all holiness.\n(1017.44, 1022.76)  Make holy, therefore, these gifts, we pray, by sending down your Spirit upon them like\n(1022.76, 1029.76)  the dewfall, so that they may become for us the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.\n(1029.76, 1035.38)  At the time he was betrayed and entered willingly into his passion, he took bread and, giving\n(1035.38, 1041.48)  thanks, broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying, Take this, all of you, and eat of\n(1041.48, 1055.48)  it for this is my body which will be given up for you in a similar way when\n(1055.48, 1059.68)  supper was ended he took the chalice and once more giving thanks he gave it to\n(1059.68, 1065.28)  his disciples saying take this all of you and drink from it for this is the\n(1065.28, 1069.76)  chalice of my blood the blood of the new and eternal covenant which will be\n(1069.76, 1074.0)  poured out for you and for many, for the forgiveness of sins.\n(1074.0, 1076.24)  Do this in memory of me.\n(1086.48, 1088.28)  The mystery of faith.\n(1088.28, 1093.32)  We proclaim your death, O Lord, and profess your resurrection\n(1093.32, 1095.84)  until you come again.\n(1095.84, 1098.12)  Therefore, as we celebrate the memorial\n(1098.12, 1099.74)  of his death and resurrection, we\n(1099.74, 1104.38)  offer you, Lord, the bread of life and the chalice of salvation, giving thanks that\n(1104.38, 1110.42)  you have held us worthy to be in your presence and minister to you. Humbly we\n(1110.42, 1115.1)  pray that, partaking of the body and blood of Christ, we may be gathered into\n(1115.1, 1120.7)  one by the Holy Spirit. Remember, Lord, your Church, spread throughout the world\n(1120.7, 1126.46)  and bring her to the fullness of charity, together with Leo our Pope and Richard\n(1126.46, 1132.06)  our bishop and all the clergy. Remember also our brothers and sisters who have\n(1132.06, 1136.7)  fallen asleep in the hope of the resurrection, and all who have died in\n(1136.7, 1143.14)  your mercy. Welcome them into the light of your face, and have mercy on us all, we\n(1143.14, 1147.7)  pray, that with the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God, Saint Joseph, her spouse,\n(1147.7, 1153.22)  with the Blessed Apostles, Saint Bridget, Saint Augustine, and all the saints who\n(1153.22, 1157.9)  have pleased you throughout the ages, that we may merit to be co-heirs to\n(1157.9, 1164.62)  eternal life and may praise and glorify you through your Son, Jesus Christ.\n(1164.62, 1170.18)  Through him and with him and in him, O God Almighty Father, in the unity of the\n(1170.18, 1176.74)  Holy Spirit all glory and honor is yours forever and ever.\n(1178.74, 1176.74) \n(1185.14, 1189.64)  At the Savior's command and formed by divine teaching, we dare to pray now. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.\n(1189.64, 1195.24)  Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.\n(1195.24, 1202.0)  Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who\n(1202.0, 1207.0)  who trespass against us, and lead us not into temptation,\n(1207.04, 1209.36)  but deliver us from evil.\n(1209.36, 1212.28)  Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil.\n(1212.28, 1214.94)  Graciously grant peace in our days,\n(1214.94, 1217.0)  that by the help of your mercy,\n(1217.0, 1221.16)  we may be always free from sin and safe from all distress,\n(1221.16, 1222.76)  as we await the blessed hope\n(1222.76, 1226.0)  in the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ.\n(1226.0, 1230.34)  The kingdom, the power, and the glory of God is power.\n(1230.34, 1232.86)  Lord Jesus Christ, who said to your apostles,\n(1232.86, 1235.66)  peace I leave you, my peace I give you.\n(1235.66, 1239.02)  Look not now on our sins, but on the faith of your church,\n(1239.02, 1241.46)  and graciously grant your peace and unity\n(1241.46, 1243.38)  in accordance with your will,\n(1243.38, 1246.7)  who live and reign forever and ever.\n(1246.7, 1249.54)  The peace of the Lord be with you always.\n(1250.58, 1253.7)  Let's offer each other some sign of Christ's peace.\n(1260.34, 1278.7)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1278.7, 1284.5)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1284.5, 1289.62)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, grant us peace.\n(1290.34, 1300.94)  Behold the Lamb of God, behold him who takes away the sins of the world, blessed are those\n(1300.94, 1303.22)  called to the Supper of the Lamb.\n(1303.22, 1308.82)  Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof, but only say the word and my\n(1308.82, 1310.82)  my soul shall be healed.\n(1338.82, 1366.82)  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n(1398.82, 1422.82)  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,\n(1422.82, 1427.82)  yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,\n(1457.82, 1485.82)  I'm going to go ahead and turn it over to you, and I'm going to turn it over to you.\n(1515.82, 1545.42)  Hail Mary,\n(1545.42, 1551.54)  full of grace, the Lord is with thee, blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit\n(1551.54, 1559.54)  of thy womb, Jesus, Holy Mary, Mother of God. Pray for us now and at the hour of our death.\n(1559.54, 1568.22)  Amen. Let us pray. Having consumed these gifts, we pray, O Lord, that by our participation\n(1568.22, 1575.3)  in this mystery, its saving effects upon us may grow through Christ our Lord. The Lord\n(1575.3, 1581.42)  be with you. May Almighty God bless you, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.\n(1581.42, 1588.58)  Our Mass has ended. We go in peace.

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah,\n(651.82, 663.82)  Hallelujah. The kingdom of God is at hand. Repent and believe in the gospel. Hallelujah.\n(663.82, 668.82)  Hallelujah.\n(668.82, 677.82)  The Lord be with you. A reading from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew.\n(677.82, 684.42)  Jesus summoned his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits to drive\n(684.42, 690.3)  them out and to cure every disease and every illness.\n(690.3, 698.22)  The names of the twelve apostles are these, first Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew,\n(698.22, 707.02)  James the son of Zebedee and his brother John, Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas and Matthew\n(707.02, 714.02)  the tax collector, James, the son of Alphaeus and Thaddeus, Simon the Cananean, and Judas\n(717.5, 724.5)  Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus. Jesus sent out these twelve after instructing them thus,\n(725.34, 732.34)  Do not go into pagan territory or enter a Samaritan town, go rather to the last sheep\n(735.18, 732.34) \n(739.34, 741.38)  rather, to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. As you go, make this proclamation,\n(748.38, 752.78)  the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\" The Gospel of the Lord.\n(759.78, 760.06)  We could add to that long list the names of each one of us here today. We are the apostles\n(759.78, 763.78)  of the present moment and the present generation,\n(763.78, 770.78)  and we are because of our baptism in the family of God.\n(770.78, 778.78)  As baptized followers of Jesus, we have the mandate, each of us,\n(778.78, 782.78)  by virtue of that baptism, to spread the good news\n(782.78, 788.78)  that Jesus taught in His time and continues to teach\n(788.78, 795.78)  in our time. It depends on us to do just what the apostles did, to spread and proclaim the\n(800.76, 807.76)  good news. How we do it is up to each one of us in the situation and circumstances in\n(808.92, 815.92)  which we find ourselves. By the good example we give, by the encouragement and support\n(816.14, 815.92) \n(818.92, 823.92)  of the poor and the unfortunate, by kindness to the people that we meet along the way,\n(823.92, 826.92)  and so many other ways that we can discover,\n(826.92, 828.92)  if we think about it,\n(828.92, 832.92)  the reason for and the purpose of\n(832.92, 835.92)  and the mandate that Jesus has given to us\n(835.92, 838.92)  as he did to these apostles.\n(838.92, 842.92)  As you go make this proclamation,\n(842.92, 846.92)  The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.\n(846.92, 854.92)  It's just as much at hand today as it was when these words were first proclaimed.\n(854.92, 861.92)  And so my question to you is, what are you doing to spread the good news?\n(861.92, 863.92)  How are you doing it?\n(863.92, 872.92)  How serious are you about the purpose of living out the mandate of your baptism?\n(872.92, 876.92)  God will help you to do this.\n(876.92, 881.92)  And we have in the psalm response,\n(881.92, 889.92)  Lord, let your mercy be on us as we place our trust in you.\n(889.92, 892.92)  We pray today for our deceased loved ones,\n(892.92, 898.52)  our benefactors, relatives and friends, for those who have been good to our parish through\n(898.52, 905.52)  the years, and particularly today for the living and deceased members of the Gate of\n(905.6, 912.6)  Heaven Memorial Society, let us pray to the Lord. For those who have no one else to pray\n(912.88, 919.88)  for them except us, and those who have asked us to pray for them, let us pray to the Lord.\n(920.88, 919.88) \n(934.44, 940.12)  to the suffering people throughout the world from all the effects of poverty, hunger, war, all the different situations in which people throughout the world are suffering, let us\n(940.12, 942.8)  pray to the Lord.\n(942.8, 949.32)  For all those who have been affected by the terrible tragedy these days in Texas, through\n(949.32, 953.82)  the terrible flooding there, the loss of lives,\n(953.82, 957.72)  and all that goes with that terribly sad situation,\n(957.72, 960.38)  that God will help them and be with them\n(960.38, 962.84)  and guide them and direct them.\n(962.84, 964.7)  Let us pray to the Lord.\n(966.46, 970.54)  For our own personal needs and intentions today,\n(970.54, 972.9)  especially for an increase in vocations\n(972.9, 975.1)  to the priesthood and religious life,\n(975.1, 977.94)  especially from our own parish,\n(977.94, 984.94)  us pray to the Lord. Oh God we ask you to hear our petitions and requests today and\n(985.86, 992.86)  to grant them if it is your will. We ask all these things through Jesus Christ our Lord.\n(1007.94, 1037.9)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation.\n(1037.9, 1043.5)  For through your goodness we have received the bread we offer you, fruit of the earth\n(1043.5, 1050.5)  and work of human hands, it will become for us the bread of life.\n(1051.7, 1057.82)  By the mystery of this water and wine, may we come to share in the divinity of Christ,\n(1057.82, 1064.82)  who humbled himself to share in our humanity.\n(1067.9, 1083.9)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, but through your goodness we have received the wine we offer you, fruit of the vine and work of human hands. It will become our spiritual drink.\n(1083.9, 1092.9)  With humble spirit and contrite heart, may we be accepted by you, O Lord.\n(1092.9, 1098.9)  And may our sacrifice in your sight this day be pleasing to you, Lord God.\n(1098.9, 1104.9)  Wash me, O Lord, from my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin.\n(1113.9, 1136.52)  Pray, brothers and sisters, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God, the Almighty\n(1136.52, 1137.52)  Father.\n(1137.52, 1156.52)  Look upon the offerings of the Church, O Lord, as she makes her prayer to you.\n(1156.52, 1166.52)  And grant that when consumed by those who believe, they may bring ever greater holiness through Christ our Lord.\n(1166.52, 1176.52)  The Lord be with you, lift up your hearts, let us give thanks to the Lord our God.\n(1196.52, 1203.52)  It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, always and everywhere, to give\n(1206.76, 1213.76)  you thanks, Lord Holy Father, Almighty and Eternal God. For in goodness you created man,\n(1214.28, 1220.92)  and when he was justly condemned, in mercy you redeemed him through Christ our Lord.\n(1220.92, 1227.92)  him the angels praise your majesty, dominions adore and powers tremble before you, heaven\n(1228.8, 1235.52)  and the virtues of heaven and the blessed seraphim worship together with exaltation.\n(1235.52, 1242.52)  May our voices, we pray, join with theirs in humble praise as we acclaim Holy, Holy,\n(1243.72, 1250.72)  Holy Lord God of hosts, heaven and earth are full of your glory, Hosanna in the highest,\n(1250.92, 1254.92)  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord,\n(1254.92, 1259.92)  Hosanna in the highest.\n(1259.92, 1266.92)  It is truly right and just.\n(1266.92, 1270.92)  You are indeed holy, O Lord, the fount of all holiness.\n(1270.92, 1273.92)  Make holy, therefore, these gifts, we pray,\n(1273.92, 1278.92)  by sending down your Spirit upon them like the dewfall,\n(1278.92, 1285.92)  so that they may become for us the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.\n(1286.92, 1290.92)  At the time he was betrayed and entered willingly into his passion,\n(1290.92, 1296.92)  he took bread, and giving thanks, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying,\n(1297.92, 1306.92)  Take this, all of you, and eat of it, for this is my body which will be given up for you.\n(1308.92, 1327.76)  In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took the chalice, and once more giving thanks,\n(1327.76, 1334.28)  he gave it to his disciples, saying, Take this, all of you, and drink from it, for this\n(1334.28, 1347.28)  This is the chalice of my blood, the blood of the new and eternal covenant, which will be poured out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins.\n(1347.28, 1351.28)  Do this in memory of me.\n(1364.28, 1375.56)  The mystery of faith. Save us, Savior of the world, for by your cross and resurrection\n(1375.56, 1383.0)  you have set us free. Therefore, as we celebrate the memorial of his death and resurrection,\n(1383.0, 1388.6)  we offer you, Lord, the bread of life and the chalice of salvation, giving thanks that\n(1388.6, 1392.2)  you have held us worthy to be in your presence\n(1392.2, 1394.48)  and minister to you.\n(1394.48, 1397.08)  Humbly we pray that partaking of the body\n(1397.08, 1401.0)  and blood of Christ, we may be gathered into one\n(1401.0, 1402.38)  by the Holy Spirit.\n(1403.34, 1406.92)  Remember, Lord, your church spread throughout the world\n(1406.92, 1409.0)  and bring her to the fullness of charity\n(1409.0, 1413.4)  together with Leo our Pope\n(1414.68, 1413.4) \n(1418.4, 1419.76)  and Richard, our bishop, and all the clergy.\n(1423.46, 1427.58)  Remember your servants, particularly the members of the society for which we offer this mass,\n(1427.58, 1432.58)  who have been called from this world to yourself.\n(1432.66, 1435.86)  Grant that they who were united with your son\n(1435.86, 1439.38)  at a death like his may also be one with him\n(1439.38, 1441.3)  and his resurrection.\n(1441.3, 1445.32)  Remember also all the living members of that society\n(1445.32, 1448.2)  and also our brothers and sisters who have fallen asleep\n(1448.2, 1450.44)  in the hope of the resurrection\n(1450.44, 1453.04)  and all who have died in your mercy.\n(1453.04, 1455.8)  Welcome them into the light of your face.\n(1455.8, 1458.48)  Have mercy on us all, we pray,\n(1458.48, 1461.88)  that with the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God,\n(1461.88, 1464.04)  with the blessed apostles,\n(1464.04, 1469.04)  with her spouse, Saint Joseph, with the blessed apostles\n(1469.04, 1473.08)  and all the saints who have pleased you throughout the ages,\n(1473.08, 1476.8)  we may merit to be co-heirs to eternal life\n(1476.8, 1479.5)  and may praise and glorify you\n(1479.5, 1482.88)  through your son, Jesus Christ.\n(1484.44, 1488.76)  Through him and with him and in him,\n(1488.76, 1493.48)  oh God almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\n(1493.48, 1498.48)  all glory and honor is yours forever and ever.\n(1498.88, 1498.48) \n(1505.48, 1511.4)  At the Savior's command and formed by divine teaching, we dare to say our Father who art\n(1518.4, 1518.96)  in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in\n(1525.96, 1527.14)  heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those\n(1525.96, 1529.76)  as we forgive those who trespass against us.\n(1529.76, 1534.76)  And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.\n(1535.68, 1539.78)  Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil.\n(1539.78, 1542.68)  Graciously grant peace in our days,\n(1542.68, 1545.04)  that by the help of your mercy,\n(1545.04, 1550.04)  we may be always free from sin and safe from all distress,\n(1550.16, 1552.42)  as we await the blessed hope\n(1552.42, 1557.42)  in the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ.\n(1557.42, 1564.42)  Lord Jesus Christ, who said to your apostles,\n(1564.42, 1567.42)  Peace I leave you, my peace I give you,\n(1567.42, 1572.42)  look not on our sins, but on the faith of your Church,\n(1572.42, 1575.42)  and graciously grant her peace and unity\n(1575.42, 1578.42)  in accordance with your will,\n(1578.42, 1581.42)  who live and reign forever and ever.\n(1581.42, 1588.86)  the peace of the Lord be with you always let us offer each other the some some\n(1588.86, 1591.82)  sign of peace\n(1603.06, 1608.58)  I am of God you take away the sins of the world have mercy on us\n(1608.58, 1614.58)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1614.58, 1620.58)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, grant us peace.\n(1620.58, 1626.58)  We are mindful of those who are with us in celebrating the Eucharist today in their homes\n(1626.58, 1632.58)  through the streaming system throughout the country and even across the ocean and other\n(1632.58, 1634.58)  parts of the world.\n(1634.58, 1640.92)  They cannot receive Holy Communion in their homes and the church wants us to help them make us a\n(1644.28, 1645.92)  Spiritual\n(1645.92, 1647.56)  communion and\n(1647.56, 1652.64)  We do that by praying together Lord Jesus Christ son of the Living God\n(1653.28, 1659.44)  Who by the will of the Father and the work of the Holy Spirit through your death gave life to the world?\n(1660.08, 1659.44) \n(1666.44, 1674.44)  free us by this, your most holy body and blood, from all our sins and from every evil. Keep us always faithful to your commandments and never let us be parted from you.\n(1676.44, 1683.44)  Behold the Lamb of God. Behold him who takes away the sins of the world.\n(1683.44, 1688.44)  Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb.\n(1688.44, 1698.44)  I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof, but only say the word and my soul shall be healed.\n(1718.44, 1742.44)  All right, let's go to the next slide, please.\n(1742.44, 1770.28)  The communion breaths for today.\n(1770.28, 1776.72)  The sparrow finds a home and the swallow a nest for her young.\n(1776.72, 1781.6)  By our altars, O Lord of hosts, my King and my God,\n(1781.6, 1784.32)  blessed are they who dwell in your house,\n(1784.32, 1786.64)  forever singing your praise.\n(1800.28, 1807.28)  I'm going to go back to the slide.\n(1830.28, 1854.28)  The body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body\n(1854.28, 1881.28)  The body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body\n(1881.28, 1886.28)  the body of Christ, the body of Christ.\n(1971.28, 1998.08)  As I always do, I ask you to please remember the priest at Regina Cleary, the priest who\n(1998.08, 2002.08)  who have served the Archdiocese for so many years\n(2002.08, 2006.66)  and are living there in the evening of our lives,\n(2006.66, 2010.44)  preparing for the last journey that we will make,\n(2010.44, 2013.48)  which hopefully is to be with God.\n(2013.48, 2015.68)  We depend on the people like yourselves\n(2015.68, 2019.72)  to pray for us and remember us.\n(2019.72, 2022.64)  We have three priests at the moment in the hospital\n(2024.6, 2022.64) \n(2027.64, 2028.6)  who are in various stages of bad health,\n(2031.68, 2035.24)  we ask you to pray especially for them. Thank you for coming to pray with us here today.\n(2035.24, 2039.92)  I hope you have a good and a safe and a happy day.\n(2039.92, 2041.26)  Let us pray.\n(2048.32, 2052.56)  Having consumed these gifts, we pray, O Lord,\n(2052.56, 2055.98)  that by your participation in this mystery,\n(2055.98, 2060.98)  its saving effects upon us may grow through Christ our Lord.\n(2062.0, 2063.52)  The Lord be with you.\n(2070.36, 2073.56)  May the Lord bless you and keep you.\n(2073.56, 2076.32)  May he let his face shine upon you\n(2076.32, 2079.62)  and show you his mercy, amen.\n(2079.62, 2085.66)  May he turn his countenance towards you and give you his peace, and may the blessing of\n(2085.66, 2092.9)  Almighty God, the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, come down upon all of you\n(2092.9, 2095.94)  and remain with you forever.\n(2095.94, 2097.66)  The Mass has ended.\n(2097.66, 2099.46)  Let us go in peace to love.\n",

I confess to Almighty God and to you my brothers and\n(304.04, 309.8)  sisters that I have greatly sinned in my thoughts and in my words and what I have\n(309.8, 313.92)  done and what I have failed to do through my fault through my fault\n(313.92, 318.74)  through my most grievous fault therefore I ask the Blessed Mary ever\n(318.74, 324.98)  Virgin all the angels and Saints and you my brothers and sisters to pray for me\n(324.98, 329.98)  to the Lord our God. May almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us our sins, and\n(329.98, 340.66)  bring us to everlasting life. Lord have mercy. Christ have mercy. Lord have mercy.\n(340.86, 349.26)  Let us pray. Oh God, who guided St. Bridget of Sweden along different paths\n(349.26, 354.5)  of life and wondrously taught her the wisdom of the cross as she\n(354.5, 359.62)  contemplated the passion of your Son, grant us, we pray, that walking worthily in\n(359.62, 364.26)  our vocation, we may seek you in all things. Through our Lord Jesus Christ,\n(364.26, 368.82)  your Son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God\n(368.82, 371.98)  forever and ever.\n(384.5, 389.44)  A reading from the book of Exodus.\n(389.44, 394.42)  The children of Israel set out from Elam and came into the desert of sin, which is between\n(394.42, 400.02)  Elam and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departure from the\n(400.02, 402.18)  land of Egypt.\n(402.18, 406.54)  Here in the desert, the whole assembly of the children of Israel grumbled against Moses\n(406.54, 408.22)  and Aaron.\n(408.22, 412.86)  The children of Israel said to them, Would that we had died at the Lord's hand in the\n(412.86, 418.1)  land of Egypt as we sat by our flesh parts and ate our fill of bread, but you\n(418.1, 423.66)  had to lead us into this desert to make the whole community die of famine. Then\n(423.66, 429.14)  the Lord said to Moses, I will now rain down bread from heaven for you. Each day\n(429.14, 433.74)  the people are to go out and gather their daily portion, thus I will test\n(433.74, 438.98)  them to see whether they follow my instructions or not. On the sixth day\n(438.98, 443.98)  however, when they prepare what they bring in, let it be twice as much as they\n(443.98, 450.14)  gather on the other days. Then Moses said to Aaron, tell the whole congregation of\n(450.14, 454.82)  the children of Israel, present yourselves before the Lord for he has\n(454.82, 459.06)  heard your grumbling. When Aaron announces to the whole assembly of the\n(459.06, 463.78)  children of Israel, they turn toward the desert and lo, the glory of the Lord\n(463.78, 469.64)  Lord appeared in the cloud. The Lord spoke to Moses and said I have heard the\n(469.64, 475.18)  grumbling of the children of Israel. Tell them in the evening twilight you shall\n(475.18, 479.58)  eat flesh and in the morning you shall have your fill of bread so that you may\n(479.58, 486.34)  know that I the Lord am your God. In the evening quail came up and covered the\n(486.34, 491.74)  camp. In the morning a dew lay all about the camp and when the dew evaporated\n(491.74, 498.7)  There on the surface of the desert were fine flakes like hoar forest on the ground.\n(498.7, 503.56)  On seeing it, the children of Israel asked one another what is this, for they did not\n(503.56, 505.48)  know what it was.\n(505.48, 510.9)  But Moses told them, this is the bread which the Lord has given you to eat.\n(510.9, 514.3)  This is the word of the Lord.\n(514.3, 521.72)  Responsorial Psalm, the Lord gave them bread from heaven.\n(521.72, 525.78)  They tempted God in their hearts by demanding the food they craved.\n(525.78, 535.12)  Yes, they spoke against God saying, can God spread a table in the desert?\n(535.12, 539.5)  Yet he commanded the skies above and the doors of heaven he opened.\n(539.5, 547.32)  He rained manner upon them for food and gave them heavenly bread.\n(547.32, 551.6)  Man ate the bread of angels, food he sent them in abundance.\n(551.6, 561.08)  He stirred up the east wind in the heavens, and by his power brought on the south wind.\n(561.08, 567.88)  And he reigned to meet upon them like dust, and like the sand of the sea winged fowl,\n(567.88, 589.16)  which fell in the midst of their camp, round about their tents.\n(589.16, 591.76)  The Lord be with you.\n(591.76, 597.44)  A reading from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew.\n(597.44, 602.04)  On that day Jesus went out of the house and sat down by the sea.\n(602.04, 606.88)  Such large crowds gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat down, and the whole\n(606.88, 609.28)  crowd stood along the shore.\n(609.28, 612.16)  And he spoke to them at length in parables, saying,\n(612.16, 617.88)  A sower went out to sow, and as he sowed some seed fell on the path, and birds came and\n(617.88, 619.32)  ate it up.\n(619.32, 622.64)  Some fell on rocky ground, where it had little soil.\n(622.64, 627.08)  It sprang up at once, because the soil was not deep, and when the sun rose it was\n(627.08, 632.32)  scorched, and it withered for lack of roots. Some seed fell among thorns, and\n(632.32, 636.76)  the thorns grew and choked it, but some seed fell on rich soil and produced\n(636.76, 643.36)  fruit, a hundred or sixty or thirtyfold. Whoever has ears ought to hear the\n(643.36, 646.36)  Gospel of the Lord.\n(648.64, 654.44)  The Catechism makes it very clear that we can't understand sacred scripture, we\n(654.44, 658.92)  can't read the Bible accurately apart from the magisterium or the tradition of\n(658.92, 664.64)  the church. We need the church to help us interpret the sacred scriptures correctly\n(664.64, 669.64)  and so there are four senses to sacred scripture or four ways that all\n(669.64, 673.48)  intertwine in which we should use when we read the sacred scriptures\n(673.48, 677.82)  particularly the Old Testament and so two of those senses that are important\n(677.82, 683.2)  for us today are the literal sense and then the allegorical sense. The literal\n(683.2, 688.92)  sense is exactly what it sounds like, what is actually literally written in the text.\n(688.92, 695.32)  And so the literal sense of the first reading from the book of Exodus actually captures\n(695.32, 702.04)  a real historical event of Moses leading the people of Israel out of Egypt into the Promised\n(702.04, 703.04)  Land.\n(703.04, 709.44)  But then the allegorical sense, which is very important for us as well, points to what this\n(709.44, 714.86)  means for our spiritual life and how it points to Christ and our struggle to\n(714.86, 721.86)  fight sin and so the book of Exodus is accurately understood as all of our\n(721.86, 728.22)  journeys from the desert the life of sin to the promised land of heaven and all\n(728.22, 733.86)  of us as we move throughout that journey in life experience the hardships of the\n(733.86, 739.06)  people of Israel when they're in the desert they want to go back to their\n(739.06, 744.86)  life of comfort and isn't this so true in our lives as well as we move from our\n(744.86, 749.86)  old ways from our sinful habits there's this really big temptation to think\n(749.86, 756.16)  maybe I was better off where I was before because at least life was easier\n(756.16, 762.04)  or more comfortable but the Lord what he's doing in the desert is he's\n(762.04, 766.4)  teaching his people and he's teaching us in those moments of dryness the very\n(766.4, 773.1)  important virtue of fortitude, because as we hear from the Gospel, grace builds on\n(773.1, 779.58)  nature. For us to become saints, we need natural virtues as well. That is the\n(779.58, 784.98)  fertile soil for the Gospel. The saint we honor today, St. Bridget of Sweden,\n(784.98, 790.46)  understood this very well. She was a wife and a mother of eight children, and she\n(790.46, 797.9)  We kept a virtuous and loving home because it's in the home where we acquire these natural\n(797.9, 804.92)  virtues that make the voice of God clear and for these virtues to begin to grow.\n(804.92, 810.26)  And so we would do well today as we move in our journey from sin to union with the Lord\n(810.26, 816.5)  to think of where are those areas in my life where I could require or acquire more natural\n(816.5, 821.66)  virtue because that's the fertile soil for the gospel to take root and so let\n(821.66, 825.76)  us stand and call upon Saint Bridget of Sweden and ask for her intercession\n(825.76, 830.9)  today. We pray for Pope Leo and for Bishop Richard Henning and for all\n(830.9, 835.08)  bishops throughout the church. May God give him the grace to be true shepherds\n(835.08, 840.8)  of souls so all can come to know the love of Christ we pray to the Lord. We\n(840.8, 844.46)  pray for an increase of vocations to the priesthood into the religious life\n(844.46, 851.06)  especially from members from our own parishes, we pray to the Lord. We pray for\n(851.06, 853.82)  all civil leaders, governments, and elected officials throughout the world.\n(853.82, 857.72)  May they enact policies that protect the church and give her the freedom to be\n(857.72, 861.64)  herself so the kingdom of God can be spread to every corner of the globe. We\n(861.64, 867.16)  pray to the Lord. And we pray for our parishioners for whom this mass is\n(867.16, 873.08)  offered. We pray to the Lord. Heavenly Father, we make these prayers with great\n(873.08, 877.58)  confidence as we ask them through the intercession of Saint Bridget of Sweden\n(877.58, 881.14)  and Mary our Morning Star and Gate of Heaven and we speak them in the name of\n(881.14, 885.94)  Jesus her son who is Lord forever and ever.\n(963.08, 974.08)  Pray, brothers and sisters, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God, the Almighty\n(974.08, 983.32)  Father.\n(983.32, 989.4)  We bring you these sacrificial gifts, O Lord, to commemorate blessed Brigid of Sweden, humbly\n(989.4, 994.48)  entreating that they may bestow on us both pardon and salvation through Christ\n(994.48, 1003.38)  our Lord. The Lord be with you. Lift up your hearts. Let us give thanks to the\n(1003.38, 1009.92)  Lord our God. It is truly right and just our duty and our salvation always and\n(1009.92, 1013.82)  everywhere to give you thanks Lord Holy Father almighty and eternal God through\n(1013.82, 1018.44)  Christ our Lord for in the marvelous confession of your Saints you make your\n(1018.44, 1023.48)  Church, fruitful with strength ever new, and offer us sure signs of your love. And\n(1023.48, 1027.96)  that your saving mysteries may be fulfilled, their great example lends us\n(1027.96, 1033.16)  courage, their fervent prayers sustain us in all we do. And so, Lord, with all the\n(1033.16, 1038.84)  angels and saints, we too give you thanks as an exultation we acclaim. Holy, holy,\n(1038.84, 1044.52)  holy, Lord God of hosts, heaven and earth are full of your glory.\n(1044.52, 1049.98)  Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.\n(1049.98, 1056.64)  Hosanna in the highest. You are indeed holy O Lord and all you have created\n(1056.64, 1061.3)  rightly gives you praise for through your son our Lord Jesus Christ by the\n(1061.3, 1065.54)  power and working of the Holy Spirit you give life to all things and make them\n(1065.54, 1069.84)  holy and you never cease to gather a people to yourself so that from the\n(1069.84, 1074.8)  rising of the Sun to its setting, a pure sacrifice may be offered to your name.\n(1074.8, 1080.04)  Therefore, O Lord, we humbly implore you, by the same Spirit graciously make holy\n(1080.04, 1083.92)  these gifts we have brought to you for consecration, that they may become the\n(1083.92, 1089.4)  body and blood of your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, at whose command we\n(1089.4, 1094.8)  celebrate these mysteries. For on the night he was betrayed, he himself took\n(1094.8, 1100.12)  bread and giving you thanks he said the blessing broke the bread and gave it to\n(1100.12, 1109.6)  his disciples saying take this all of you and eat of it for this is my body\n(1109.6, 1114.4)  which will be given up for you\n(1124.8, 1136.8)  In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took the chalice, and giving you thanks, he said the blessing, and gave the chalice to his disciples, saying,\n(1136.8, 1151.8)  Take this, all of you, and drink from it, for this is the chalice of my blood, the blood of the new and eternal covenant, which will be poured out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins.\n(1151.8, 1157.04)  Do this in memory of me.\n(1169.52, 1175.88)  The mystery of faith. Save us, Savior of the world, for by your cross and\n(1175.88, 1180.88)  resurrection you have set us free. Therefore, O Lord, as we celebrate the\n(1180.88, 1184.76)  memorial of the saving passion of your Son, his wondrous resurrection and\n(1184.76, 1188.68)  ascension into heaven, and as we look forward to his second coming, we offer\n(1188.68, 1192.88)  you in thanksgiving this holy and living sacrifice. Look, we pray, upon the\n(1192.88, 1197.08)  oblation of your Church, in recognizing the sacrificial victim by whose death\n(1197.08, 1201.48)  you willed to reconcile us to yourself. Grant that we who are nourished by the\n(1201.48, 1205.76)  body and blood of your Son, and filled with his Holy Spirit, may become one body,\n(1205.76, 1210.56)  one spirit in Christ. May he make of us an eternal offering to you, so that we\n(1210.56, 1215.44)  You may obtain an inheritance with your elect, especially with the Most Blessed Virgin Mary,\n(1215.44, 1220.96)  Mother of God, with Blessed Joseph, her spouse, with your blessed apostles and glorious martyrs,\n(1220.96, 1224.16)  with St. Brigid of Sweden, and with all the saints.\n(1224.16, 1228.8)  Under its constant intercession in your presence, we rely for unfailing help.\n(1228.8, 1233.88)  May this sacrifice of our reconciliation, we pray, O Lord, advance the peace and salvation\n(1233.88, 1235.14)  of all the world.\n(1235.14, 1239.32)  Be pleased to confirm in faith and charity your pilgrim church on earth, with your servant\n(1239.32, 1243.36)  Leo, our Pope, and Richard, our Bishop, the Order of Bishops,\n(1243.36, 1245.2)  all the clergy, and the entire people\n(1245.2, 1247.18)  you have gained for your own.\n(1247.18, 1250.44)  Listen graciously to the prayers of this family, whom\n(1250.44, 1253.0)  you have summoned before you, and your compassionate,\n(1253.0, 1254.44)  merciful Father.\n(1254.44, 1256.12)  Gather to yourself all your children\n(1256.12, 1257.72)  scattered throughout the world.\n(1257.72, 1259.64)  To our departed brothers and sisters,\n(1259.64, 1261.88)  and to all who are pleasing to you at their passing\n(1261.88, 1265.04)  from this life, give kind admittance to your kingdom.\n(1265.04, 1268.0)  There we hope to enjoy forever the fullness of your glory\n(1268.0, 1269.4)  through Christ our Lord,\n(1269.4, 1272.24)  through whom you bestow on the world all that is good.\n(1275.2, 1278.04)  Through him and with him and in him,\n(1278.04, 1281.6)  O God, almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\n(1281.6, 1285.12)  all glory and honor is yours forever and ever.\n(1286.96, 1291.06)  At the Savior's command, informed by divine teaching,\n(1291.06, 1295.54)  we dare to say, our Father, who art in heaven,\n(1295.54, 1298.7)  hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come,\n(1298.7, 1302.14)  thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.\n(1302.14, 1304.82)  Give us this day our daily bread\n(1304.82, 1307.18)  and forgive us our trespasses\n(1307.18, 1310.7)  as we forgive those who trespass against us\n(1310.7, 1315.06)  and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.\n(1315.06, 1317.38)  Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil.\n(1317.38, 1319.62)  Graciously grant peace in our days,\n(1319.62, 1321.06)  that by the help of your mercy,\n(1321.06, 1324.86)  we may be always free from sin and safe from all distress\n(1324.86, 1333.82)  we await the blessed hope and the coming of our Savior Jesus Christ. Lord Jesus\n(1333.82, 1338.18)  Christ who said to your apostles peace I leave you my peace I give you look not\n(1338.18, 1342.18)  in our sins but on the faith of your church and graciously grant her peace and\n(1342.18, 1346.58)  unity in accordance with your will who live and reign forever and ever. The\n(1346.58, 1353.34)  peace of the Lord be with you always. Let us offer each other the sign of peace.\n(1354.34, 1353.34) \n(1360.18, 1365.26)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us. Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1365.26, 1369.62)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, grant us peace.\n(1383.34, 1391.38)  Behold, the Lamb of God, behold Him who takes away the sins of the world.\n(1391.38, 1394.26)  Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb.\n(1394.26, 1399.94)  Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof, but only say the word and my\n(1399.94, 1406.94)  my soul shall be healed.\n(1429.94, 1451.18)  The kingdom of heaven is like a merchant who travels in search of fine pearls and who on\n(1451.18, 1456.78)  finding one of great price, sold everything and bought it.\n(1629.18, 1657.18)  So, thank you very much for your attention and we'll see you in the next session.\n(1717.18, 1727.02)  Let us pray.\n(1727.02, 1732.68)  May the working of this divine sacrament enlighten and inflame us, Almighty God, on this feast\n(1732.68, 1738.66)  day of Blessed Brigid of Sweden, that we may be ever fervent with holy desires, and abound\n(1738.66, 1742.14)  in good works, through Christ our Lord.\n(1742.14, 1744.42)  The Lord be with you.\n(1744.42, 1746.18)  May Almighty God bless you.\n(1746.18, 1749.62)  the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit.\n(1749.62, 1751.5)  Go forth, the Mass has ended.\n(1753.56, 1757.12)  Saint Michael, the archangel, defend us in battle.\n(1757.12, 1759.38)  Be our protection against the wickedness\n(1759.38, 1761.18)  and snares of the devil.\n(1761.18, 1763.94)  May God rebuke him, we humbly pray,\n(1763.94, 1766.78)  and do thou the prince of the heavenly hosts\n(1766.78, 1770.3)  by the power of God, cast into hell Satan\n(1770.3, 1773.42)  and all the evil spirits who prowl about the world\n(1773.42, 1775.46)  seeking the ruin of souls.\n(1775.46, 1776.3)  Amen.\n(1835.46, 1863.46)  Yeah.\n(1895.46, 1896.46)  You were right.\n(1896.46, 1897.46)  You didn't say all that.\n(1897.46, 1898.46)  You were right.\n(1898.46, 1899.46)  You were right.\n(1899.46, 1900.46)  You didn't say all that.\n(1900.46, 1901.46)  You were right.\n(1901.46, 1902.46)  You were right.\n(1902.46, 1903.46)  You were right.\n(1903.46, 1904.46)  You were right.\n(1904.46, 1905.46)  You were right.\n(1905.46, 1906.46)  You were right.\n(1906.46, 1907.46)  You were right.\n(1907.46, 1908.46)  You were right.\n(1908.46, 1909.46)  You were right.\n(1909.46, 1910.46)  You were right.\n(1910.46, 1911.46)  You were right.\n(1911.46, 1912.46)  You were right.\n(1912.46, 1913.46)  You were right.\n(1913.46, 1914.46)  You were right.\n(1914.46, 1915.46)  You were right.\n(1915.46, 1916.46)  You were right.\n(1916.46, 1917.46)  You were right.\n(1917.46, 1918.46)  You were right.\n(1918.46, 1919.46)  You were right.\n(1919.46, 1920.46)  You were right.\n(1920.46, 1921.46)  You were right.\n(1921.46, 1922.46)  You were right.\n(1922.46, 1923.46)  You were right.\n(1923.46, 1924.46)  You were right.\n(1924.46, 1931.46)  Okay, thank you so much for having me.\n",

He takes away every branch in me\n(634.52, 641.16)  that does not bear fruit and everyone that does he prunes so that it bears\n(641.16, 648.32)  more fruit. You are already pruned because of the word that I spoke to you.\n(648.32, 657.82)  Remain in me as I remain in you just as a branch cannot bear fruit on its own\n(657.82, 666.08)  home, unless it remains on the vine, so neither can you unless you remain in me.\n(666.08, 671.62)  I am the vine, you are the branches.\n(671.62, 679.44)  Whoever remains in me and I in him will bear much fruit because without me you can do nothing.\n(679.44, 685.6)  Anyone who does not remain in me will be thrown out like a branch and wither.\n(685.6, 691.24)  People will gather them and throw them into a fire and they will be burned.\n(691.24, 698.32)  If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask for whatever you want and it will\n(698.32, 700.6)  be done for you.\n(700.6, 710.4)  By this is my Father glorified that you bear much fruit and become my disciples.\"\n(710.4, 712.84)  the Gospel of the Lord.\n(718.8, 724.44)  Remain in me as I remain in you is a very simple and direct\n(724.44, 728.72)  mandate on the part of our blessed Lord.\n(728.72, 730.44)  In the words of the Gospel today,\n(730.44, 738.44)  we are reminded that if we do make an effort to follow Jesus\n(738.44, 741.62)  as he has asked us to do,\n(741.62, 745.86)  then certainly we will benefit from that.\n(745.86, 750.06)  Following Jesus for you and for me in our day\n(750.06, 752.98)  is to be the best of what we can be,\n(752.98, 756.42)  mindful of the fact that God lives in us\n(756.42, 760.46)  and that we are his disciples.\n(760.46, 765.46)  As we go, so will go others if we give them the example\n(765.7, 765.46) \n(772.46, 778.46)  that we should be giving by living a faithful and loyal and devoted life. How blessed we are, my dear friends, to have such a mission, all of us,\n(778.46, 784.46)  from different places and different types and shapes and forms.\n(784.46, 788.46)  All of us, however, are the children of God.\n(788.46, 792.46)  He loves us and he wants us to follow him.\n(792.46, 797.46)  And so I ask the question, what are you doing to make sure\n(799.26, 804.26)  that you are walking day in and day out with Jesus?\n(806.66, 809.06)  We pray today for our deceased loved ones,\n(809.06, 812.26)  our benefactors, relatives, and friends.\n(812.26, 813.74)  For those who've been good to us\n(813.74, 816.5)  and good to our parish through the years,\n(816.5, 818.88)  let us pray to the Lord.\n(820.34, 818.88) \n(826.9, 833.54)  For an increase in vocations to the priesthood and religious life, particularly from among the families of our own parish, let us pray to the Lord.\n(833.54, 839.54)  For those who are sick and suffering and dying, those who live nearby, shut up in their own\n(839.54, 848.02)  homes, those who are in the hospitals and in the nursing homes nearby, those suffering\n(848.02, 855.54)  Going throughout the world from all the effects of poverty, tragedy, hunger, homelessness,\n(855.54, 856.54)  and war.\n(856.54, 863.7)  For all of these, let us pray to the Lord.\n(863.7, 874.74)  For an increase in vocations to the priesthood, for every blessing you and I need to walk\n(874.74, 880.26)  more faithfully in the footsteps of Jesus, let us pray to the Lord.\n(883.06, 890.5)  For the repose of the soul of Kenneth Blasey, for whom we offer our Mass today, let us pray to the\n(890.5, 899.94)  Lord. And for all our own needs and intentions that we've kept quietly in our hearts, let us pray\n(899.94, 907.46)  to the Lord. Oh God, we ask you to hear these petitions in request of ours and to grant them\n(907.46, 925.46)  if it is your will. We ask all these things through Jesus Christ our Lord.\n(929.94, 959.58)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through your goodness we have received\n(959.58, 963.12)  the bread we offer you, fruit of the earth and work\n(963.12, 970.28)  of human hands, it will become for us the bread of life.\n(970.28, 972.88)  By the mystery of this water and wine,\n(972.88, 976.76)  may we come to share in the divinity of Christ, who humbled\n(976.76, 980.28)  himself to share in our humanity.\n(986.76, 980.28) \n(987.28, 993.04)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through your goodness we have received\n(1000.04, 1000.24)  the wine we offer you, fruit of the vine and work of human hands, it will become our spiritual\n(1007.24, 1009.8)  drink. With humble spirit and contrite heart, may we be accepted by you, O Lord, and may\n(1007.24, 1014.24)  be accepted by you, O Lord, and may our sacrifice in your sight this day be pleasing to you,\n(1015.32, 1022.32)  Lord God. Wash me, O Lord, from my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin.\n(1037.24, 1059.24)  Pray, brothers and sisters, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God, the Almighty\n(1059.24, 1061.24)  Father.\n(1061.24, 1068.24)  O Lord, we pray the offerings which we bring from the abundance of your gifts, that through\n(1069.14, 1076.14)  the powerful working of your grace, these most sacred mysteries may sanctify our present\n(1077.34, 1084.34)  way of life and lead us to eternal gladness through Christ our Lord.\n(1084.98, 1084.34) \n(1093.34, 1105.34)  The Lord be with you. Lift up your hearts. Let us give thanks to the Lord our God. It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, always and everywhere, to give you thanks, Lord Holy Father, Almighty and Eternal God.\n(1105.34, 1113.5)  For we know it belongs to your boundless glory that you came to the aid of mortal beings\n(1113.5, 1120.94)  with your divinity and even fashioned for us a remedy out of mortality itself that the\n(1120.94, 1129.26)  cause of our downfall might become the means of our salvation through Christ our Lord.\n(1129.26, 1138.18)  Through Him, the host of angels adores your majesty and rejoices in your presence forever.\n(1138.18, 1146.82)  May our voices, we pray, join with theirs in one chorus of exultant praise as we acclaim\n(1146.82, 1154.38)  Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts, heaven and earth full of your glory, whose honor\n(1154.38, 1161.9)  in the highest. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, Hosanna in the highest.\n(1163.98, 1169.66)  You are indeed holy, O Lord, the fount of all holiness. Make holy, therefore, these gifts,\n(1169.66, 1178.06)  we pray, by sending down your Spirit upon them like the dewfall, so that they may become for us\n(1178.06, 1183.5)  the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.\n(1183.5, 1189.32)  At the time he was betrayed and entered willingly into his passion, he took bread and giving\n(1189.32, 1196.32)  thanks broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying take this, all of you, and eat of it,\n(1198.52, 1205.52)  for this is my body which will be given up for you.\n(1208.06, 1223.06)  In a similar way when supper was ended he took the chalice and once more giving thanks\n(1223.06, 1230.38)  he gave it to his disciples saying take this all of you and drink from it for this is the\n(1230.38, 1237.38)  chalice of my blood, the blood of the new and eternal covenant which will be poured\n(1237.82, 1244.82)  out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Do this in memory of me.\"\n(1260.38, 1276.38)  The mystery of faith. Save us, Savior of the world, for by your cross and resurrection you have set us free.\n(1276.38, 1287.38)  Therefore, as we celebrate the memorial of his death and resurrection, we offer you, Lord, the bread of life and the chalice of salvation,\n(1287.38, 1295.06)  giving thanks that you have held us worthy to be in your presence and minister to you.\n(1295.06, 1299.46)  Humbly we pray that, partaking of the Body and Blood of Christ,\n(1299.46, 1303.3)  we may be gathered into one by the Holy Spirit.\n(1304.66, 1310.74)  Remember, Lord, your Church spread throughout the world, and bring it to the fullness of charity\n(1310.74, 1318.74)  together with Leo, our Pope, and Richard, our Bishop, and all the Clergy.\n(1318.74, 1325.74)  Remember your servant, Kenneth Blasey, whom you have called from this world to yourself.\n(1325.74, 1335.74)  Grant that he who was united with your son in a death like his may also be one with him in his resurrection.\n(1335.74, 1346.24)  Remember also our brothers and sisters who have fallen asleep in the hope of the resurrection and all who have died in your mercy.\n(1346.24, 1350.24)  Welcome them into the light of your face.\n(1350.24, 1355.74)  Have mercy on us all, we pray, that with the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God,\n(1355.74, 1363.74)  with Blessed Joseph, her spouse, with the Blessed Apostles and all the saints who have pleased you throughout the ages,\n(1363.74, 1374.74)  we may merit to be co-heirs to eternal life and may praise and glorify You through Your Son, Jesus Christ.\n(1374.74, 1385.74)  Through Him and with Him and in Him, O God, Almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\n(1385.74, 1392.74)  all glory and honor is Yours forever and ever.\n(1392.74, 1398.74)  Amen.\n(1398.74, 1403.24)  At the Savior's command informed by divine teaching,\n(1403.24, 1409.58)  we dare to say our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.\n(1409.58, 1411.44)  Thy kingdom come.\n(1411.44, 1415.24)  Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.\n(1415.24, 1420.52)  Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses\n(1420.52, 1424.52)  as we forgive those who trespass against us.\n(1424.52, 1429.88)  And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.\n(1429.88, 1433.52)  Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil.\n(1433.52, 1436.68)  Graciously grant peace in our days,\n(1436.68, 1441.44)  that by the help of your mercy we may be always free from sin\n(1441.44, 1447.08)  and safe from all distress as we await the blessed hope\n(1447.08, 1451.64)  and the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ.\n(1451.64, 1455.08)  For the kingdom, the power and the glory are yours,\n(1455.08, 1456.64)  now and forever.\n(1456.64, 1460.08)  Lord Jesus Christ, who said to your apostles,\n(1460.08, 1464.24)  peace I leave you, my peace I give you,\n(1464.24, 1468.72)  look not on our sins, but on the faith of your church,\n(1468.72, 1472.3)  and graciously grant her peace and unity\n(1472.3, 1474.6)  in accordance with your will,\n(1474.6, 1478.32)  who live and reign forever and ever.\n(1478.32, 1482.48)  The peace of the Lord be with you always.\n(1482.48, 1485.48)  Let us offer each other some sign of peace.\n(1500.92, 1485.48) \n(1506.68, 1512.86)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.

        "transcript": "(269.0, 292.78)  Good morning, everyone.\n(292.78, 298.66)  In your prayers today, we'd ask you to remember Adeline Callan for whom this Mass is offered.\n(298.66, 303.5)  In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, the grace of our Lord\n(303.5, 310.26)  Jesus Christ and the love of God and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with all of you.\n(310.26, 315.3)  Today we celebrate the feast of St. Benedict Abbot, of course the patriarch of Western\n(315.3, 319.38)  monasticism and also a patron of Europe.\n(319.38, 323.82)  As we honor St. Benedict today, we take a moment as we ask the Lord's forgiveness for\n(323.82, 332.58)  So those times that we have failed to love God have failed to love one another.\n(332.58, 335.42)  Lord have mercy.\n(335.42, 337.9)  Christ have mercy.\n(337.9, 340.74)  Lord have mercy.\n(340.74, 347.74)  May almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us our sins, and bring us to everlasting life.\n(347.74, 351.58)  Let us pray.\n(351.58, 359.5)  O God who made the abbot St. Benedict an outstanding master in the school of divine service, grant\n(359.5, 365.18)  we pray that putting nothing before love of you, we may hasten with a loving heart in\n(365.18, 367.94)  the way of your commands.\n(367.94, 372.1)  Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of\n(372.1, 393.34)  Holy Spirit God forever and ever a reading from the book of Genesis Israel\n(393.34, 399.1)  set out with all that was with all that was his when he arrived at Beersheba he\n(399.1, 404.46)  He offered sacrifices to the God of his father, Isaac, their God, speaking to Israel in a\n(404.46, 408.78)  vision by night, called, Jacob, Jacob.\n(408.78, 410.62)  He answered, Here I am.\n(410.62, 414.66)  Then he said, I am God, the God of your father.\n(414.66, 419.66)  Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for there I will make you a great nation.\n(419.66, 424.32)  Not only will I go down to Egypt with you, I will also bring you back here, after Joseph\n(424.32, 426.54)  has closed your eyes.\n(426.54, 430.8)  So Jacob departed from Beersheba, and the sons of Israel put their father and their\n(430.8, 436.22)  wives and children on the wagons that Pharaoh had sent for their transport.\n(436.22, 439.9)  They took with them their livestock and the possessions they had acquired in the land\n(439.9, 440.9)  of Canaan.\n(440.9, 444.92)  Thus Jacob and all his descendants migrated to Egypt.\n(444.92, 450.12)  His sons and his grandsons, his daughters and his granddaughters, all his descendants,\n(450.12, 453.28)  he took with them to Egypt.\n(453.28, 458.22)  Israel had sent Judah ahead to Joseph, so that he might meet him in Goshen.\n(458.22, 463.48)  On his arrival in the region of Goshen, Joseph hitched the horses to his chariot and rode\n(463.48, 466.5)  to meet his father, Israel, in Goshen.\n(466.5, 472.5)  As soon as Joseph saw him, he flung himself on his neck and wept a long time in his arms.\n(472.5, 478.02)  And Israel said to Joseph, At last I can die, now that I have seen for myself that Joseph\n(478.02, 479.66)  is still alive.\n(479.66, 482.66)  The word of the Lord.\n(482.66, 491.94)  The salvation of the just comes from the Lord.\n(491.94, 497.44)  Trust in the Lord and do good, that you may dwell on the land and be fed in security.\n(497.44, 505.58)  Take delight in the Lord and he will grant you your heart's requests.\n(505.58, 508.44)  The Lord watches over the lives of the wholehearted.\n(508.44, 510.92)  Their inheritance lasts forever.\n(510.92, 513.22)  They are not put to shame at an evil time.\n(513.22, 515.38)  In days of famine, they have plenty.\n(520.38, 523.74)  Turn from evil and do good, that you may abide forever,\n(523.74, 525.42)  for the Lord loves what is right\n(525.42, 527.74)  and forsakes not his faithful ones.\n(532.54, 534.94)  The salvation of the just is from the Lord.\n(534.94, 537.66)  He is their refuge in time of distress,\n(537.66, 539.98)  and the Lord helps them and delivers them.\n(539.98, 545.72)  He delivers them from the\n(569.68, 545.72) \n(574.68, 575.72)  May the Lord be with you.\n(578.52, 580.56)  you.\" Jesus said to his apostles,\n(580.56, 585.86)  Behold, I am sending you like sheep in the midst of wolves.\n(585.86, 590.58)  So be shrewd as serpents and simple as doves.\n(590.58, 597.28)  But be aware of men, for they will hand you over to courts and scourge you in their synagogues,\n(597.28, 602.82)  and you will be led before governors and kings for my sake as a witness before them and the\n(602.82, 605.12)  pagans.\n(605.12, 610.78)  When they hand you over, do not worry about how you are to speak or what you are to say.\n(610.78, 615.46)  You will be given at that moment what you are to say.\n(615.46, 621.94)  For it will not be you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through me.\n(621.94, 625.86)  Brother will hand over brother to death and father his child.\n(625.86, 630.58)  Children will rise up against parents and have them put to death.\n(630.58, 638.3)  You will be hated by all because of my name, but whoever endures to the end will be saved.\n(638.3, 642.14)  When they persecute you in one town, flee to another.\n(642.14, 649.1)  Amen, I say to you, you will not finish the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.\n(649.1, 658.02)  The Gospel of the Lord.\n(658.02, 662.22)  as we celebrate the Feast of St. Benedict we remember not only a man who\n(662.22, 667.86)  shaped Western monasticism but really a spiritual father who taught the church\n(667.86, 674.26)  how to seek God in all things, even in the midst of a chaotic and hostile world\n(674.26, 680.9)  that he lived in 1,500 years ago. And how fitting is the gospel we hear today from\n(680.9, 687.18)  Matthew where Jesus sends his disciples and apostles out into a dangerous world,\n(687.18, 692.74)  world, a confused world, saying, Behold, I am sending you like sheep in the midst of\n(692.74, 697.34)  wolves, so be shrewd as serpents and simple as doves.\n(697.34, 704.9)  Of course, those words echo across centuries finding new life in every saint who dares\n(704.9, 709.74)  to follow Christ radically, especially like Saint Benedict.\n(709.74, 716.38)  Saint Benedict's famous rule, the rule of Saint Benedict, begins with an invitation\n(716.38, 725.18)  to the monk listen my son with the ear of your heart listen my son with the ear\n(725.18, 731.94)  of your heart that is the posture of the disciple Christ speaks of in today's\n(731.94, 740.62)  gospel someone who was attentive alert and surrendered to God's will Christ and\n(740.62, 747.52)  his command to both wise and the innocent find a profound expression in\n(747.52, 753.64)  St. Benedict's life. In that rule of St. Benedict written 1,500 years ago and\n(753.64, 759.58)  still followed today by many Benedictine monasteries around the world, the monk\n(759.58, 767.6)  was asked always to be watchful, not paranoid but watchful and discerning. And\n(767.6, 778.04)  His rule is deeply practical. It goes by the Latin aura et labora, aura et labora.\n(778.04, 787.0)  It's a balancing of prayer and work, prayer and labor, solitude and community,\n(787.0, 792.8)  authority and obedience. It teaches us how to live as citizens of heaven while\n(792.8, 799.28)  still walking the reality of this world here, and his rule taught monks to listen\n(799.28, 805.0)  with that ear of the heart, to live with balance and humility, and to seek God in\n(805.0, 811.4)  all things. Now we don't need to wear a habit or live in a monastery to be\n(811.4, 819.04)  Benedictine in spirit. You simply need to say yes to the slow and often unnoticed\n(819.04, 826.88)  work of God in your life. Whether you are a student, a parent, a worker, a priest,\n(826.88, 833.68)  like myself, your monastery really is where you're at right now. So today let\n(833.68, 840.84)  us follow Christ with courage, listen to Christ with the air of our hearts, and\n(840.84, 847.6)  like St. Benedict, seek God. Seek God above all things, so that in all things\n(847.6, 855.16)  things God may be glorified. Let us pray.\n(856.44, 862.56)  Together we join our hearts and minds in the presence of the Father and offer Him\n(862.56, 868.44)  these petitions. We pray for the church throughout the world, that like Saint\n(868.44, 873.16)  Benedict we may be a sign of wisdom, peace, and stability in a troubled world.\n(873.16, 880.9)  we pray to the Lord that national and international leaders may be empowered\n(880.9, 886.98)  by the Holy Spirit to serve their people after the example of Christ we pray to\n(886.98, 894.56)  the Lord for all those affected by the recent floods in Texas especially the\n(894.56, 900.42)  victims the displaced and emergency responders that they may find safety\n(900.42, 908.9)  comfort and aid in their time of need we pray to the Lord for all the sick that\n(908.9, 915.66)  God's healing presence may be with them we pray to the Lord for the faithful\n(915.66, 921.22)  departed especially today we remember Adeline Callan for whom this mass is\n(921.22, 926.42)  offered that they may enter into the heavenly reward promised by Jesus we\n(926.42, 933.02)  pray to the Lord. God, our Father, please hear our petitions and grant us your\n(933.02, 937.98)  grace. We ask this through Christ our Lord.\n(956.42, 970.1)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through your goodness we have received\n(970.1, 972.18)  the bread we offer you.\n(972.18, 979.18)  Fruit of the earth and work of human hands, it will become for us the bread of life.\n(979.18, 983.66)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through your goodness we have received\n(983.66, 985.66)  the wine we offer you.\n(985.66, 1006.06)  of the vine and work of human hands, it will become our spiritual drink.\n(1006.06, 1011.94)  Pray brothers and sisters that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God the Almighty\n(1011.94, 1026.18)  Father. Look kindly Lord upon these holy offerings which we make in honor of Saint\n(1026.18, 1032.58)  Benedict and grant that by following his example in seeking you we may merit the\n(1032.58, 1039.36)  gifts of unity in your service and of peace through Christ our Lord. The Lord be\n(1039.36, 1048.88)  with you. Lift up your hearts. Let us give thanks to the Lord our God. It is truly\n(1048.88, 1053.92)  right and just, our duty and our salvation, always and everywhere to give\n(1053.92, 1060.42)  you thanks, Lord, Holy Father, Almighty and Eternal God. For in the saints who\n(1060.42, 1065.64)  consecrated themselves to Christ for the sake of the kingdom of heaven, it is\n(1065.64, 1070.56)  right to celebrate the wonders of your providence by which you call human\n(1070.56, 1076.44)  nature back to its original holiness and bring it to experience on this earth the\n(1076.44, 1081.28)  gifts you promise in the new world to come. And so with all the angels and\n(1081.28, 1088.96)  saints we praise you as without end we now acclaim. Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of\n(1088.96, 1095.56)  hosts, heaven and earth are full of your glory, hosanna in the highest. Blessed\n(1095.56, 1098.48)  is he who comes in the name of the Lord,\n(1098.48, 1100.28)  Hosanna in the highest.\n(1103.04, 1106.54)  You are indeed holy, O Lord, the fount of all holiness.\n(1106.54, 1109.62)  Make holy, therefore, these gifts, we pray,\n(1109.62, 1113.44)  by sending down your Spirit upon them like the dewfall,\n(1113.44, 1116.16)  so that they may become for us the body and blood\n(1116.16, 1119.16)  of our Lord Jesus Christ.\n(1119.16, 1121.12)  At the time he was betrayed\n(1121.12, 1123.84)  and entered willingly into his passion,\n(1123.84, 1129.2)  He took bread, and giving thanks, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying,\n(1129.2, 1136.2)  Take this, all of you, and eat of it, for this is my body, which will be given up for you.\n(1145.32, 1150.04)  In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took the chalice, and once more, giving thanks,\n(1150.04, 1154.96)  He gave it to his disciples saying take this all of you and drink from it\n(1155.12, 1159.24)  For this is the chalice of my blood the blood of the new and eternal covenant\n(1159.76, 1166.68)  Which will be poured out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins do this in memory of me\n(1175.56, 1166.68) \n(1181.92, 1187.92)  the mystery of faith when we eat this bread and drink this cup we proclaim your death O Lord until you come again therefore as we celebrate the memorial\n(1187.92, 1192.3)  of his death and resurrection we offer you Lord the bread of life and the\n(1192.3, 1197.74)  chalice of salvation, giving thanks that you have held us worthy to be in your\n(1197.74, 1203.3)  presence and minister to you. Humbly we pray that partaking of the body and\n(1203.3, 1209.18)  blood of Christ we may be gathered into one by the Holy Spirit. Remember Lord\n(1209.18, 1213.66)  your church spread throughout the world and bring her to the fullness of charity\n(1213.66, 1219.92)  together with Leo our Pope and Richard our Bishop and all the clergy. Remember\n(1219.92, 1225.22)  For also our brothers and sisters who have fallen asleep in the hope of the resurrection\n(1225.22, 1231.64)  and all who have died in your mercy, welcome them into the light of your face.\n(1231.64, 1237.16)  Have mercy on us all, we pray, that with the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God, St. Joseph,\n(1237.16, 1242.84)  her spouse, with the Blessed Apostles, St. Benedict, St. Bridget, St. Augustine, and\n(1242.84, 1248.6)  all the saints who have pleased you throughout the ages, that we may merit to be co-heirs\n(1248.6, 1255.08)  eternal life and may praise and glorify you through your son Jesus Christ\n(1255.08, 1260.36)  through him and with him and in him Oh God Almighty Father in the unity of the\n(1260.36, 1271.32)  Holy Spirit all glory and honor is yours forever and ever at the Savior's command\n(1271.32, 1277.48)  informed by divine teaching we dare to pray now our father who art in heaven\n(1277.48, 1284.56)  hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.\n(1284.56, 1291.24)  Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive\n(1291.24, 1297.36)  those who trespass against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us\n(1297.36, 1303.48)  from evil. Deliver us Lord we pray from every evil graciously grant peace in our\n(1303.48, 1308.64)  days that by the help of your mercy we may be always free from sin and safe\n(1308.64, 1313.4)  from all distress as we await the blessed hope in the coming of our Savior\n(1313.4, 1316.28)  Jesus Christ.\n(1318.8, 1324.24)  Lord Jesus Christ who said to your apostles peace I leave you my peace I\n(1324.24, 1329.28)  give you look not now on our sins but on the faith of your church and graciously\n(1329.28, 1335.12)  grant your peace and unity in accordance with your will, live and reign forever and ever.\n(1336.0, 1353.12)  The peace of the Lord be with you always. Let's offer each other some sign of Christ's peace.\n(1359.28, 1368.28)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1368.28, 1373.76)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1373.76, 1382.16)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, grant us peace.\n(1382.16, 1387.28)  Behold the Lamb of God, behold him who takes away the sins of the world.\n(1387.28, 1390.4)  are those called to the supper of the Lamb.\n(1390.4, 1394.26)  Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof,\n(1394.26, 1398.42)  but only say the word and my soul shall be healed.\n(1447.28, 1451.28)  Thank you for joining us today, and we'll be getting started in\n(1451.28, 1453.28)  just a few minutes.\n(1537.28, 1544.28)  So, thank you very much.\n(1597.28, 1609.28)  Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.\n(1609.28, 1614.32)  Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.\n(1614.32, 1620.4)  Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death.\n(1620.4, 1621.4)  Amen.\n(1621.4, 1624.36)  Let us pray.\n(1624.36, 1629.8)  Having received this pledge of eternal life, we humbly beseech you, O Lord, that attentive\n(1629.8, 1636.04)  to the teaching of St. Benedict, we may faithfully serve your designs and love one another with\n(1636.04, 1640.44)  fervent charity, through Christ our Lord.\n(1640.44, 1642.98)  The Lord be with you.\n(1642.98, 1647.6)  May Almighty God bless you, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.\n(1647.6, 1648.94)  Our Mass has ended.\n(1648.94, 1649.94)  We go in peace.\n(1649.94, 1652.28)  Have a great day, everybody.\n",

        "transcript": "(90.0, 97.0)  Thank you for joining us today, and we'll be getting started in about a minute.\n(240.0, 261.5)  Good morning, everyone.\n(261.5, 267.04)  In your prayers today, we'd ask you to remember Evelyn Conley for whom this mass is offered.\n(267.04, 272.24)  In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, the grace of our Lord\n(272.24, 279.0)  Jesus Christ and the love of God and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with all of you.\n(279.0, 285.32)  Today we celebrate the feast of St. Benedict who was abbot of course and the patriarch\n(285.32, 295.38)  of western monasticism formed of course many Benedictine abbeys around Europe 1500 years\n(295.38, 300.5)  ago and they still survive today with many Benedictine abbeys all around the\n(300.5, 306.26)  country of the United States and all around the world. So as we honor St.\n(306.26, 311.22)  Benedict today we take a moment before we begin asking the Lord's forgiveness\n(311.22, 324.82)  for our sins. Lord have mercy. Christ have mercy. Lord have mercy. May Almighty God\n(324.82, 330.82)  May God have mercy on us, forgive us our sins, and bring us to everlasting life.\n(330.82, 332.82)  Let us pray.\n(332.82, 339.82)  O God who made the abbot Saint Benedict an outstanding master in the school of divine service,\n(339.82, 347.82)  grant, we pray, that putting nothing before love of you, we may hasten with a loving heart in the way of your commands.\n(347.82, 352.08)  our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy\n(352.08, 363.24)  Spirit, God forever and ever.\n(363.24, 367.52)  A reading from the book of Genesis.\n(367.52, 370.72)  Israel set out with all that was his.\n(370.72, 378.14)  When he arrived at Beersheba, he offered sacrifices to the God of his father, Isaac.\n(378.14, 385.42)  There God, speaking to Israel in a vision by night, called, Jacob, Jacob.\n(385.42, 388.3)  He answered, Here I am.\n(388.3, 392.94)  Then he said, I am God, the God of your father.\n(392.94, 399.46)  Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for there I will make you a great nation.\n(399.46, 406.22)  Not only will I go down to Egypt with you, I will also bring you back here after Joseph\n(406.22, 409.26)  has closed your eyes.\"\n(409.26, 414.86)  So Jacob departed from Beersheba, and the sons of Israel put their father and their\n(414.86, 421.7)  wives and children on the wagons that Pharaoh had sent for his transport.\n(421.7, 427.5)  They took with them their livestock and the possessions they had acquired in the land\n(427.5, 428.5)  of Canaan.\n(428.5, 436.5)  Thus Jacob and all his descendants migrated to Egypt, his sons and his grandsons, his\n(436.5, 444.46)  daughters and his granddaughters, all his descendants he took with him to Egypt.\n(444.46, 450.34)  Israel had sent Judah ahead to Joseph so that he might meet him in Goshen.\n(450.34, 457.3)  On his arrival in the region of Goshen, Joseph hitched the horses to his chariot and rode\n(457.3, 461.22)  to meet his father, Israel, in Goshen.\n(461.22, 466.14)  As soon as Joseph saw him, he flung himself on his neck\n(466.14, 469.9)  and wept a long time in his arms.\n(469.9, 474.78)  And Israel said to Joseph, at last I can die,\n(474.78, 480.3)  now that I have seen for myself that Joseph is still alive.\n(480.3, 483.7)  The word of the Lord.\n(483.7, 493.5)  The response to the real psalm, the salvation of the just comes from the Lord.\n(493.5, 500.3)  Trust in the Lord and do good that you may dwell in the land and be fed in security.\n(500.3, 509.74)  Take delight in the Lord and he will grant you your heart's requests.\n(509.74, 513.42)  The Lord watches over the lives of the wholehearted.\n(513.42, 516.38)  Their inheritance lasts forever.\n(516.38, 519.86)  They are not put to shame in an evil time.\n(519.86, 527.52)  In days of famine they have plenty.\n(527.52, 534.28)  Turn from evil and do good, that you may abide forever, for the Lord loves what is right\n(534.28, 541.84)  and forsakes not his faithful ones.\n(541.84, 545.6)  The salvation of the just is from the Lord.\n(545.6, 549.04)  He is their refuge in time of distress,\n(549.04, 552.04)  and the Lord helps them and delivers them.\n(552.04, 555.6)  He delivers them from the wicked and saves them,\n(555.6, 557.96)  because they take refuge in Him.\n(571.84, 589.44)  the Lord be with you a reading from the holy gospel according to Matthew Jesus\n(589.44, 596.0)  said to his apostles behold I am sending you like sheep in the midst of wolves so\n(596.0, 601.8)  be shrewd as serpents and simple as doves but beware of men for they will\n(601.8, 607.64)  will hand you over to courts and scourge you in their synagogues, and you will be led before\n(607.64, 614.64)  governors and kings for my sake, as a witness before them and the pagans.\n(614.64, 620.72)  When they hand you over, do not worry about how you are to speak or what you are to say.\n(620.72, 628.6)  You will be given at that moment what you are to say, for it will not be you who speak\n(628.6, 631.98)  but the spirit of your father speaking through you.\n(633.22, 635.46)  Brother will hand over brother to death\n(635.46, 636.98)  and father his child.\n(636.98, 639.46)  Children will rise up against parents\n(639.46, 641.86)  and have them put to death.\n(641.86, 645.46)  You will be hated by all because of my name,\n(645.46, 649.32)  but whoever endures to the end will be saved.\n(649.32, 653.88)  When they persecute you in one town, flee to another.\n(653.88, 657.46)  Amen, I say to you, you will not finish the towns of Israel\n(657.46, 662.3)  before the Son of Man comes, the Gospel of the Lord.\n(668.86, 672.26)  Today as we celebrate the Feast of Saint Benedict,\n(672.26, 677.26)  we remember not only a man who shaped Western monasticism,\n(678.3, 682.18)  but also a spiritual father who taught the church\n(682.18, 685.1)  how to seek God in all things,\n(685.1, 689.08)  even in the midst of a chaotic and hostile world\n(689.08, 692.54)  in which he lived 1500 years ago.\n(692.54, 695.6)  And how fitting is the gospel we hear today from Matthew\n(695.6, 700.2)  where Jesus sends his disciples out into a dangerous world,\n(700.2, 703.44)  saying, behold, I'm sending you like sheep\n(703.44, 705.8)  in the midst of wolves.\n(705.8, 709.5)  So be shrewd as serpents and simple as doves.\n(710.6, 713.48)  Those words echo over centuries,\n(713.48, 716.84)  finding new life in every saint, every follow\n(716.84, 719.68)  who is dared to follow Christ radically,\n(719.68, 724.22)  especially today as we celebrate Saint Benedict.\n(724.22, 728.38)  Saint Benedict's famous rule begins with an invitation.\n(729.6, 734.48)  Listen, my son, with the air of your heart.\n(734.48, 738.36)  Listen, my son, with the air of your heart.\n(739.36, 743.24)  That is the posture of the disciple Christ speaks of\n(743.24, 747.78)  in today's gospel, someone who is attentive, alert,\n(747.78, 751.54)  someone who surrenders to God's will in their lives.\n(752.64, 757.52)  Christ's command to be both wise and innocent\n(757.52, 761.72)  finds a profound expression in Saint Benedict's life.\n(761.72, 763.68)  In his Rule of Saint Benedict,\n(763.68, 768.68)  again written 1,500 years ago and still followed today\n(768.68, 772.68)  in many Benedictine monasteries around the world,\n(772.68, 775.4)  The monk, Saint Benedict would say,\n(775.4, 778.48)  must always be watchful.\n(778.48, 782.82)  Not paranoid, but watchful, discerning.\n(783.8, 787.06)  His rule is deeply practical,\n(787.06, 792.06)  and in Latin, he would say aura et labora.\n(792.36, 795.22)  Aura et labora.\n(796.32, 799.2)  Prayer and work.\n(799.2, 803.3)  balancing prayer and labor,\n(803.3, 806.68)  balancing solitude in the monastery\n(806.68, 810.38)  and also community in the monastery,\n(810.38, 813.32)  authority and obedience.\n(813.32, 816.66)  It teaches us how to live as citizens of heaven\n(816.66, 821.16)  while still walking in the reality of the world that we live.\n(822.32, 824.56)  His rule taught monks to listen\n(824.56, 827.48)  with the air of their hearts,\n(827.48, 830.32)  to live with balance and humility\n(830.32, 832.9)  and to seek God in all things.\n(833.88, 836.84)  Now you don't have to wear a habit\n(836.84, 841.54)  or live in a monastery to be Benedictine in spirit.\n(842.52, 846.66)  You simply need to say yes to that slow\n(846.66, 850.8)  and often unnoticed work of God in your life.\n(851.68, 855.36)  Whether you're a student or a parent or a worker,\n(855.36, 856.84)  a priest like myself.\n(856.84, 861.84)  Your monastery is where you are at at this moment.\n(861.84, 865.28)  So today let us follow Christ with courage,\n(865.28, 869.16)  listen to Christ with the ear of your heart,\n(869.16, 874.16)  and like Saint Benedict, seek God above all\n(874.8, 878.72)  so that in all things God may be glorified.\n(882.36, 883.32)  Let us pray.\n(885.36, 891.58)  Together we join our hearts and minds in the presence of God the Father and offer these petitions\n(892.48, 896.84)  We pray for the church throughout the world that like st. Benedict\n(897.0, 903.26)  We may be a sign of wisdom peace and stability in a troubled world. We pray to the Lord\n(905.44, 910.48)  That national and international leaders may be empowered by the Holy Spirit\n(911.08, 910.48) \n(918.88, 925.08)  spirit to serve their people after the example of Christ, we pray to the Lord. For all those affected in the recent floods in Texas, especially the victims, those who\n(925.08, 932.04)  have been displaced, those who are lost, and our emergency responders, that they may find\n(932.04, 939.52)  safety, comfort, and aid in their time of need, we pray to the Lord.\n(939.52, 942.78)  For all the sick, those in hospital or nursing home,\n(942.78, 946.12)  those undergoing surgery or treatment today,\n(946.12, 949.16)  that God's healing presence may be with them,\n(949.16, 950.82)  we pray to the Lord.\n(952.66, 954.86)  We pray for all the faithful departed.\n(954.86, 957.5)  Today we remember Evelyn Conley,\n(957.5, 959.84)  for whom this Mass is offered,\n(959.84, 962.64)  that they may enter into our heavenly reward\n(962.64, 965.88)  promised by Jesus, we pray to the Lord.\n(967.54, 965.88) \n(971.88, 974.88)  And God, our Father, please hear our petitions and grant us your grace. We ask our prayers through Christ our Lord.\n(995.88, 1014.24)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through your goodness we have received\n(1014.24, 1019.4)  the bread we offer you, fruit of the earth and work of human hands, it will become for\n(1019.4, 1023.64)  us the bread of life.\n(1023.64, 1028.26)  You Lord God of all creation for through your goodness. We have received the wine\n(1028.26, 1034.72)  We offer you fruit of the vine and work of human hands. It will become our spiritual drink\n(1053.64, 1057.14)  Pray, brothers and sisters, that my sacrifice and yours\n(1057.14, 1060.48)  may be acceptable to God, the almighty Father.\n(1070.32, 1073.6)  Look kindly, Lord, upon these holy offerings\n(1073.6, 1076.6)  which we make in honor of Saint Benedict,\n(1076.6, 1080.84)  and grant that by following his example and seeking you,\n(1080.84, 1083.96)  we may merit the gifts of unity in your service\n(1083.96, 1087.38)  and of peace, through Christ our Lord.\n(1089.72, 1091.08)  The Lord be with you.\n(1092.32, 1093.9)  Lift up your hearts.\n(1094.92, 1097.68)  Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.\n(1098.98, 1102.88)  It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,\n(1102.88, 1105.16)  always and everywhere to give you thanks,\n(1105.16, 1109.32)  Lord Holy Father, almighty and eternal God.\n(1109.32, 1112.52)  For in the saints who consecrated themselves to Christ\n(1112.52, 1115.08)  for the sake of the kingdom of heaven,\n(1115.08, 1118.24)  it is right to celebrate the wonders of your providence\n(1118.24, 1123.12)  by which you call human nature back to its original holiness\n(1123.12, 1125.56)  and bring it to experience on this earth\n(1125.56, 1129.26)  the gifts you promised in the new world to come.\n(1129.26, 1131.28)  And so with all angels and saints,\n(1131.28, 1135.2)  we praise you as without end we now acclaim.\n(1135.2, 1139.44)  Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts,\n(1139.44, 1142.32)  heaven and earth are full of your glory,\n(1142.32, 1144.32)  Hosanna in the highest.\n(1144.32, 1147.54)  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord,\n(1147.54, 1149.18)  Hosanna in the highest.\n(1151.52, 1155.08)  You are indeed holy, O Lord, the fount of all holiness.\n(1155.08, 1158.1)  Make holy, therefore, these gifts, we pray,\n(1158.1, 1161.84)  by sending down your Spirit upon them like the dewfall,\n(1161.84, 1163.66)  so that they may become for us\n(1163.66, 1166.8)  the body and blood of our Lord, Jesus Christ.\n(1167.74, 1169.74)  At the time He was betrayed\n(1169.74, 1172.6)  and entered willingly into His passion,\n(1172.6, 1175.1)  He took bread and giving thanks, broke it,\n(1175.1, 1177.9)  and gave it to His disciples saying,\n(1177.9, 1181.04)  take this, all of you, and eat of it.\n(1181.04, 1185.18)  For this is my body which will be given up for you.\n(1185.18, 1199.9)  In a similar way, when supper was ended, He took the chalice, and once more, giving thanks,\n(1199.9, 1205.74)  He gave it to His disciples, saying, Take this, all of you, and drink from it, for this\n(1205.74, 1211.22)  is the chalice of My blood, the blood of the new and eternal covenant, which will be poured\n(1211.22, 1226.74)  out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Do this in memory of me.\n(1226.74, 1233.46)  The mystery of faith. When we eat this bread and drink this cup, we proclaim your death,\n(1233.46, 1239.34)  O Lord, until you come again. Therefore, as we celebrate the memorial of His death and\n(1239.34, 1241.8)  and resurrection we offer you, Lord,\n(1241.8, 1245.1)  the bread of life and the chalice of salvation,\n(1245.1, 1247.42)  giving thanks that you have held us worthy\n(1247.42, 1251.1)  to be in your presence and minister to you.\n(1251.1, 1253.74)  Humbly we pray that partaking of the body\n(1253.74, 1256.78)  and blood of Christ, we may be gathered into one\n(1256.78, 1259.04)  by the Holy Spirit.\n(1259.04, 1262.66)  Remember, Lord, your church spread throughout the world\n(1262.66, 1265.34)  and bring her to the fullness of charity,\n(1265.34, 1268.92)  together with Leo, our pope, and Richard, our bishop,\n(1268.92, 1271.16)  and all the clergy.\n(1271.16, 1273.42)  Remember also our brothers and sisters\n(1273.42, 1277.3)  who have fallen asleep in the hope of the resurrection,\n(1277.3, 1280.2)  and all who have died in your mercy.\n(1280.2, 1283.68)  Welcome them into the light of your face.\n(1283.68, 1285.7)  Have mercy on us all, we pray,\n(1285.7, 1288.96)  that with the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God,\n(1288.96, 1292.92)  Saint Joseph, her spouse, with the blessed apostles,\n(1292.92, 1295.92)  Saint Benedict, Saint Bridget, Saint Augustine,\n(1295.92, 1298.4)  and all the saints who have pleased you\n(1298.4, 1302.12)  throughout the ages, that we may merit to be co-heirs\n(1302.12, 1305.8)  to eternal life, and may praise and glorify you\n(1305.8, 1308.36)  through your Son, Jesus Christ.\n(1309.88, 1312.12)  Through him, and with him, and in him,\n(1312.12, 1315.36)  O God, almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\n(1315.36, 1320.08)  all glory and honor is yours, forever and ever.\n(1323.64, 1326.72)  At the Savior's command, informed by divine teaching,\n(1326.72, 1333.0)  We dare to pray now, Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.\n(1333.0, 1338.42)  Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.\n(1338.42, 1344.96)  Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who\n(1344.96, 1352.68)  trespass against us, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.\n(1352.68, 1356.14)  Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil.\n(1356.14, 1360.98)  Graciously grant peace in our days that by the help of your mercy we may be always free\n(1360.98, 1366.06)  from sin and safe from all distress as we await the blessed hope and the coming of our\n(1366.06, 1373.18)  Savior, Jesus Christ.\n(1373.18, 1378.92)  Lord Jesus Christ, who said to your apostles, Peace I leave you, my peace I give you, look\n(1378.92, 1384.0)  not now on our sins but on the faith of your Church and graciously grant your peace and\n(1384.0, 1386.52)  in unity and accordance with your will,\n(1386.52, 1389.56)  to live and reign forever and ever.\n(1389.56, 1393.2)  The peace of the Lord be with you always.\n(1393.2, 1396.28)  Let's offer each other some sign of Christ's peace.\n(1414.0, 1420.0)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1420.0, 1425.0)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1425.0, 1431.0)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, grant us peace.\n(1431.0, 1438.0)  Behold the Lamb of God, behold Him who takes away the sins of the world.\n(1438.0, 1441.0)  Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb.\n(1441.0, 1447.8)  Lord I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof, but only say the word and my soul shall be healed\n(1591.0, 1619.84)  Hail Mary, full of grace.\n(1619.84, 1623.64)  The Lord is with thee, blessed art thou among women,\n(1623.64, 1626.52)  and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.\n(1626.52, 1630.02)  Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners,\n(1630.02, 1632.86)  now and at the hour of our death, amen.\n(1632.86, 1633.92)  Let us pray.\n(1637.1, 1640.54)  Having received this pledge of eternal life,\n(1640.54, 1642.46)  we humbly beseech you, O Lord,\n(1642.46, 1645.74)  that attentive to the teaching of Saint Benedict,\n(1645.74, 1648.94)  we may faithfully serve your designs\n(1648.94, 1651.92)  and love one another with fervent charity,\n(1651.92, 1654.52)  through Christ our Lord.\n(1654.52, 1656.04)  The Lord be with you.\n(1657.04, 1658.64)  May almighty God bless you.\n",

        "transcript": "(238.0, 246.1)  You have redeemed us Lord by your blood from every tribe and tongue and people\n(246.1, 250.38)  and nation and have made us into a kingdom for our God. In the name of the\n(250.38, 256.62)  Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, the Lord be with you. Today's Mass\n(256.62, 260.22)  is offered for our parishioners and we celebrate a votive Mass of the most\n(260.22, 264.82)  precious blood of Jesus. My brothers and sisters let us acknowledge our sins and\n(264.82, 269.58)  so prepare ourselves to celebrate the sacred mysteries.\n(269.58, 276.7)  I confess to Almighty God and to you my brothers and sisters that I have greatly sinned in\n(276.7, 282.04)  my thoughts and in my words and what I have done and what I have failed to do through\n(282.04, 286.62)  my fault, through my fault, through my most grievous fault.\n(286.62, 292.66)  Therefore I ask the blessed Mary ever virgin, all the angels and saints and you my brothers\n(292.66, 298.06)  and sisters to pray for me to the Lord our God. May almighty God have mercy on\n(298.06, 305.28)  us, forgive us our sins and bring us to everlasting life. Lord have mercy. Christ\n(305.28, 315.96)  have mercy. Lord have mercy. Let us pray. O God, who by the precious blood of your\n(315.96, 320.88)  only begotten Son have redeemed the whole world, preserve in us the work of\n(320.88, 325.54)  your mercy so that ever honoring the mystery of our salvation we may merit to\n(325.54, 330.54)  obtain its fruits through our Lord Jesus Christ your Son who lives and reigns\n(330.54, 336.14)  with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit God forever and ever.\n(350.18, 336.14) \n(354.82, 355.82)  A reading from the book of Exodus.\n(355.82, 357.86)  Moses, hearing the voice of the Lord from the burning bush, said to him,\n(357.86, 361.32)  When I go to the children of Israel and say to them,\n(361.32, 364.3)  The God of your fathers has sent me to you.\n(364.3, 368.88)  If they ask me what is his name, what am I to tell them?\n(368.88, 372.02)  God replied, I am who I am.\n(372.02, 379.42)  Then he added, this is what you shall tell the children of Israel, I am sent me to you.\n(379.42, 385.2)  God spoke further to Moses, thus shall you say to the children of Israel, the Lord the\n(385.2, 391.38)  God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob has sent me\n(391.38, 392.9)  to you.\n(392.9, 398.66)  This is my name forever, this is my title for all generations.\n(398.66, 403.98)  Go and assemble the elders of Israel and tell them, the Lord the God of your fathers, the\n(403.98, 410.86)  God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, has appeared to me and said, I am concerned about you and\n(410.86, 417.82)  about the way you have been treated in Egypt, so I have decided to lead you up out of the\n(417.82, 424.22)  the misery of Egypt and to the\n(446.44, 424.22) \n(429.52, 429.92)  Hevites, and Jezusites,\n(431.92, 436.92)  Thus they will heed your message. Then you and the elders of Egypt shall go to the King of Egypt and say to them,\n(436.92, 441.92)  The Lord, the God of the Hebrews, has sent us forward.\n(441.92, 445.92)  Permit us to go on a three days journey to the desert,\n(445.92, 449.92)  so that we may offer sacrifice to the Lord our God.\n(449.92, 452.92)  Yet I know that the King of Egypt will not allow you to go\n(452.92, 457.92)  unless he is forced.\n(481.42, 457.92) \n(463.26, 472.84)  by doing all kinds of wondrous deeds there. After that, he will send you away. The word of the Lord. Responsorial Psalm. The Lord remembers Covenant forever.\n(472.84, 478.46)  The Lord remembers his Covenant forever. Give thanks to the Lord, invoke his name,\n(478.46, 483.72)  make known among the nations his deeds. Recall the wondrous deeds that he has\n(483.72, 488.52)  has wrought his portents\n(512.34, 488.52) \n(491.52, 497.0)  Lord remembers his covenant forever. He remembers forever his covenant which he made binding for a thousand generations, which\n(497.0, 501.88)  he entered into with Abraham and by his oath to Isaac.\n(501.88, 504.98)  The Lord remembers his covenant forever.\n(504.98, 510.4)  He greatly increased his people and made them stronger than their foes, whose hearts he\n(510.4, 516.92)  changed so that they hated his people and dealt deceitfully with his servants.\n(516.92, 519.92)  The Lord remembers his sentiment forever.\n(519.92, 524.08)  He sent Moses' servants, Aaron whom he had chosen.\n(524.08, 526.2)  They wrought the signs among them\n(526.2, 528.92)  and wonders in the land of Ham.\n(528.92, 531.68)  The Lord remembers his sentiment forever.\n(546.92, 556.82)  the Lord be with you a reading from the holy gospel according to Matthew Jesus\n(556.82, 563.76)  said come to me all you who labor in our burden and I will give you rest take my\n(563.76, 568.96)  yoke upon you and learn from me for I am meek and humble of heart and you will\n(568.96, 575.56)  find rest for yourselves for my yoke is easy in my burden light the gospel of\n(575.56, 588.08)  the Lord. Every word that Jesus utters in the gospel reveals the very deep truth\n(588.08, 592.28)  about all of us and I think this is especially true with the first line he\n(592.28, 598.88)  says today. Come to me all you who labor and are burdened and I will give you\n(598.88, 605.92)  rest. Every human heart is labored and burdened and just desperately looking\n(605.92, 611.36)  for rest. And so Jesus tells us what we are to do if we want to find that rest.\n(611.36, 618.76)  We have to take his yoke upon us and learn from him. A yoke is what is\n(618.76, 624.96)  strapped to two beasts of burden to plow a field. There's always two beasts side\n(624.96, 631.68)  by side. This is the first lesson if we want to find rest. We need to walk side\n(631.68, 636.88)  by side with Jesus. What makes us feel labored and burdened is when we feel\n(636.88, 642.52)  alone and isolated and we fall into a very main spiritual trap of self-reliance.\n(642.52, 648.24)  We need to be tethered to the yoke of Christ in order to rest in his peace and\n(648.24, 655.48)  And secondly, in a yoke, the animals are not really able to look around anywhere.\n(655.48, 660.96)  Their eyes have to be faced forward because there's not really freedom of movement.\n(660.96, 667.12)  Oftentimes we get distracted by other things in the world and we take our eyes off of Christ.\n(667.12, 673.5)  And this leads to anxiety and to fear and to self-reliance, which can be very destructive.\n(673.5, 679.34)  And so a very practical thing for us today is to say what yoke am I tethered to?\n(679.34, 682.32)  Am I seeing the world through Christ's eyes?\n(682.32, 687.08)  Am I keeping my gaze faced on him and fixed on him?\n(687.08, 690.16)  Because that is the only way to find rest.\n(690.16, 695.72)  And so let us stand and make our petitions known to our Heavenly Father.\n(695.72, 700.16)  We pray for Pope Leo and for Bishop Richard Henning and for all bishops throughout the\n(700.16, 701.16)  church.\n(701.16, 706.3)  May God give them the grace to be true shepherds of souls, who help us be tethered to Christ\n(706.3, 707.9)  and find rest in his peace.\n(707.9, 710.96)  We pray to the Lord.\n(710.96, 715.08)  We pray for all civil leaders, governments, and elected officials throughout the world.\n(715.08, 719.46)  May they enact policies that protect the Church and give her the freedom to be herself, so\n(719.46, 722.44)  the Kingdom of God can be spread to every corner of the globe.\n(722.44, 725.18)  We pray to the Lord.\n(725.18, 730.38)  We pray for an increase of vocations to the priesthood and to the religious life, especially\n(730.38, 734.3)  from members from our own parishes and our own families. We pray to the Lord.\n(735.98, 740.3)  And we pray for our parishioners for whom this mass is offered. We pray to the Lord.\n(742.22, 746.3)  Heavenly Father, we make these prayers with great confidence as we ask them through the\n(746.3, 751.1)  intercession of Mary, our Morning Star and Gate of Heaven, and we speak them in the name of Jesus,\n(751.1, 755.66)  her son, who was Lord forever and ever.\n(841.1, 851.54)  Pray, brothers and sisters, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God, the Almighty\n(851.54, 861.76)  Father.\n(861.76, 867.18)  As we offer our oblation to your majesty, O Lord, may we draw near in these mysteries\n(867.18, 869.98)  to Jesus, the mediator of the new covenant,\n(869.98, 872.92)  and celebrate anew the sprinkling of his blood,\n(872.92, 877.32)  in which lies all our salvation, through Christ our Lord.\n(878.22, 879.6)  The Lord be with you.\n(880.86, 882.28)  Lift up your hearts.\n(883.44, 885.88)  Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.\n(887.32, 890.26)  It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,\n(890.26, 892.6)  always and everywhere to give you thanks,\n(892.6, 894.84)  Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God,\n(894.84, 896.54)  through Christ our Lord,\n(896.54, 898.34)  for the days of his saving passion\n(898.34, 901.14)  and glorious resurrection are approaching,\n(901.14, 904.06)  by which the pride of the ancient foe was vanquished\n(904.06, 906.8)  and the mystery of our redemption in Christ is celebrated.\n(906.8, 909.62)  Through him, the host of angels adores your majesty\n(909.62, 911.82)  and rejoices in your presence forever.\n(911.82, 914.34)  May our voices, we pray, join with theirs,\n(914.34, 917.6)  and one chorus of exultant praise as we acclaim.\n(917.6, 921.9)  Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts,\n(921.9, 924.5)  heaven and earth are full of your glory.\n(924.5, 926.64)  Oh, Zana in the highest.\n(926.64, 929.88)  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.\n(929.88, 931.86)  Oh, Zana in the highest.\n(933.76, 935.86)  You are indeed holy, oh Lord,\n(935.86, 938.44)  and all you have created rightly gives you praise.\n(938.44, 941.36)  For through your son, our Lord Jesus Christ,\n(941.36, 943.96)  by the power and working of the Holy Spirit,\n(943.96, 946.8)  you give life to all things and make them holy,\n(946.8, 949.68)  and you never cease to gather a people to yourself,\n(949.68, 952.52)  so that from the rising of the sun to its setting,\n(952.52, 956.0)  a pure sacrifice may be offered to your name.\n(956.0, 958.86)  Therefore, O Lord, we humbly implore you,\n(958.86, 961.8)  by the same Spirit graciously make holy these gifts\n(961.8, 964.0)  we have brought to you for consecration,\n(964.0, 966.88)  that they may become the body and blood\n(966.88, 969.68)  of your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ,\n(969.68, 972.6)  at whose command we celebrate these mysteries.\n(972.6, 975.04)  For on the night he was betrayed,\n(975.04, 978.28)  he himself took bread, and giving you thanks,\n(978.28, 980.92)  he said the blessing, broke the bread,\n(980.92, 984.7)  and gave it to his disciples, saying,\n(984.7, 989.16)  take this, all of you, and eat of it.\n(989.16, 994.2)  For this is my body, which will be given up for you.\n(1008.44, 994.2) \n(1014.12, 1018.84)  In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took the chalice, and giving you thanks, he said the blessing, and gave the chalice to his disciples, saying,\n(1018.84, 1033.84)  Take this, all of you, and drink from it, for this is the chalice of my blood, the blood of the new and eternal covenant, which will be poured out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins.\n(1033.84, 1036.84)  Do this in memory of me.\n(1048.84, 1059.32)  The mystery of faith. Save us, Savior of the world, for by your cross and resurrection,\n(1059.32, 1064.78)  you have set us free. Therefore, O Lord, as we celebrate the memorial of the saving passion\n(1064.78, 1069.54)  of your Son, his wondrous resurrection and ascension into heaven, and as we look forward\n(1069.54, 1074.98)  to his second coming, we offer you in thanksgiving this holy and living sacrifice. Look, we pray,\n(1074.98, 1076.94)  upon the oblation of your church,\n(1076.94, 1079.02)  and recognizing the sacrificial victim\n(1079.02, 1082.42)  by whose death you willed to reconcile us to yourself.\n(1082.42, 1083.9)  Grant that we who are nourished\n(1083.9, 1086.0)  by the body and blood of your son,\n(1086.0, 1087.46)  and filled with this Holy Spirit,\n(1087.46, 1090.4)  may become one body, one spirit in Christ.\n(1090.4, 1093.06)  May he make of us an eternal offering to you,\n(1093.06, 1095.92)  so that we may obtain an inheritance with your elect,\n(1095.92, 1098.2)  especially with the most blessed Virgin Mary,\n(1098.2, 1101.38)  Mother of God, with blessed Joseph, her spouse,\n(1101.38, 1103.9)  with your blessed apostles and glorious martyrs,\n(1103.9, 1105.38)  and with all the saints,\n(1105.38, 1107.78)  on whose constant intercession in your presence\n(1107.78, 1109.86)  we rely for unfailing help.\n(1109.86, 1113.58)  May this sacrifice of our reconciliation, we pray, O Lord,\n(1113.58, 1116.5)  advance the peace and salvation of all the world.\n(1116.5, 1118.7)  Be pleased to confirm in faith and charity\n(1118.7, 1120.22)  your pilgrim church on earth,\n(1120.22, 1123.78)  with your servant Leo, our pope, and Richard, our bishop,\n(1123.78, 1125.9)  the order of bishops, all the clergy,\n(1125.9, 1128.74)  and the entire people you have gained for your own.\n(1128.74, 1132.02)  Listen graciously to the prayers of this family,\n(1132.02, 1133.96)  whom you have summoned before you.\n(1133.96, 1136.28)  In your compassion, O merciful Father,\n(1136.28, 1138.08)  gather to yourself all your children\n(1138.08, 1139.76)  scattered throughout the world.\n(1139.76, 1141.92)  To our departed brothers and sisters,\n(1141.92, 1143.24)  and to all who are pleasing to you\n(1143.24, 1145.12)  at their passing from this life,\n(1145.12, 1147.0)  give kind admittance to your kingdom.\n(1147.0, 1150.0)  There we hope to enjoy forever the fullness of your glory,\n(1150.0, 1151.42)  through Christ our Lord,\n(1151.42, 1154.32)  through whom you bestow on the world all that is good.\n(1157.96, 1160.78)  Through him and with him and in him,\n(1160.78, 1164.58)  O God Almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\n(1164.58, 1168.28)  all glory and honor is yours forever and ever.\n(1170.02, 1173.96)  At the Savior's command, informed by divine teaching,\n(1173.96, 1178.32)  we dare to say, our Father, who art in heaven,\n(1178.32, 1181.32)  hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come,\n(1181.32, 1184.76)  thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.\n(1184.76, 1187.4)  Give us this day our daily bread,\n(1187.4, 1189.78)  and forgive us our trespasses,\n(1189.78, 1193.12)  as we forgive those who trespass against us,\n(1193.12, 1197.48)  and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.\n(1197.48, 1200.0)  Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil.\n(1200.0, 1202.26)  Graciously grant peace in our days,\n(1202.26, 1203.64)  that by the help of your mercy,\n(1203.64, 1207.36)  we may be always free from sin and safe from all distress,\n(1207.36, 1208.7)  as we await the blessed hope\n(1208.7, 1211.62)  and the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ.\n(1216.12, 1218.68)  Lord Jesus Christ, who said to your apostles,\n(1218.68, 1220.88)  Peace I leave you, my peace I give you.\n(1220.88, 1223.76)  Look not on our sins, but on the faith of your church,\n(1223.76, 1225.8)  and graciously grant her peace and unity\n(1225.8, 1227.36)  in accordance with your will,\n(1227.36, 1229.88)  who live and reign forever and ever.\n(1229.88, 1232.06)  The peace of the Lord be with you always.\n(1233.1, 1235.44)  Let us offer each other the sign of peace.\n(1239.32, 1242.92)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world,\n(1242.92, 1244.8)  have mercy on us.\n(1244.8, 1248.16)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world,\n(1248.16, 1250.04)  Have mercy on us.\n(1250.04, 1253.2)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world.\n(1253.2, 1254.16)  Grant us peace.\n(1271.2, 1273.44)  Behold the Lamb of God.\n(1273.44, 1276.8)  Behold Him who takes away the sins of the world.\n(1276.8, 1280.04)  Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb.\n(1280.04, 1284.24)  Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof,\n(1284.24, 1287.28)  but only say the word and my soul shall be healed.\n(1306.8, 1333.92)  The chalice of blessing that we bless is a communion in the blood of Christ, and the\n(1333.92, 1338.52)  bread that we break is a sharing in the body of the Lord.\n(1513.92, 1541.92)  So, thank you very much for your attention and we'll see you in the next session.\n(1541.92, 1548.92)  So, thank you very much for being with us today, and we'll see you next time.\n(1571.92, 1601.42)  Let us pray, refreshed, O Lord, by this saving food and drink, we pray that we may always\n(1601.42, 1606.52)  be bathed in the blood of our Savior, so that it may become for us a spring of\n(1606.52, 1613.92)  water, welling up to eternal life, through Christ our Lord. The Lord be with you, may\n(1613.92, 1620.14)  Almighty God bless you, the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Go forth, the\n(1620.14, 1627.16)  Mass has ended. St. Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle, and be our\n(1627.16, 1631.96)  protection against the wickedness and snares of the devil. May God rebuke him\n(1631.96, 1637.04)  we humbly pray and do thou with a prince of the heavenly hosts by the power of\n(1637.04, 1642.8)  God cast into hell Satan and all the evil spirits who prowl about the world\n(1642.8, 1647.32)  seeking the rune of souls. Amen.\n(1717.16, 1745.16)  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n",

We're\n(344.36, 351.36)  offering the Mass today for a special intention. The entrance Antiphon for today, as for me,\n(353.08, 351.36) \n(361.36, 362.36)  As for me, in justice, I shall behold your face, I shall be filled with the vision of your glory.\n(371.36, 380.36)  Brothers and sisters, let us acknowledge our sins and so prepare ourselves to celebrate the sacred mysteries.\n(371.36, 385.36)  Have mercy on us, O Lord, for we have sinned against you.\n(385.36, 390.36)  Show us, O Lord, your mercy and grant us your salvation.\n(390.36, 400.36)  May Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us our sins, and bring us to everlasting life. Amen.\n(400.36, 405.36)  Let us pray.\n(405.36, 411.36)  O God who showed the light of your truth to those who go astray,\n(411.36, 415.36)  so that they may return to the right path,\n(415.36, 422.36)  give all who for the faith they profess are accounted Christians.\n(422.36, 428.36)  The grace to reject whatever is contrary to the name of Christ\n(428.36, 436.6)  To strive after all that does it honor, to our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives\n(436.6, 457.64)  and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God forever and ever.\n(457.64, 461.08)  A reading from the book of Exodus.\n(461.08, 465.88)  Moses, hearing the voice of the Lord from the burning bush,\n(465.88, 469.88)  said to him, when I go to the children of Israel\n(469.88, 475.08)  and say to them, the God of your fathers has sent me to you,\n(475.08, 480.88)  if they ask me what is his name, what am I to tell them?\n(480.88, 485.2)  God replied, I am who am.\n(485.2, 488.38)  Then he added, this is what you shall tell\n(488.38, 492.9)  the children of Israel, I am sent me to you.\n(494.08, 498.2)  God spoke further to Moses, thus shall you say\n(498.2, 501.8)  to the children of Israel, the Lord,\n(501.8, 505.18)  the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham,\n(505.18, 509.64)  the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob has sent me to you.\n(510.52, 512.92)  This is my name forever.\n(512.92, 517.28)  This is my title for all generations.\n(517.28, 523.92)  Go and assemble the elders of Israel and tell them, the Lord, the God of your fathers, the\n(523.92, 532.72)  God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, has appeared to me and said, I am concerned about you and\n(532.72, 539.28)  about the way you are being treated in Egypt, so I have decided to lead you up out of the\n(539.28, 546.28)  the misery of Egypt into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and\n(547.04, 554.04)  Jebusites, a land flowing with milk and honey. Thus they will heed your message. Then you\n(556.28, 563.28)  and the elders of Israel shall go to the king of Egypt and say to him, The Lord, the God\n(563.28, 566.36)  of the Hebrews has sent us word.\n(566.36, 571.04)  Permit us then to go three days' journey in the desert,\n(571.04, 576.12)  that we may offer sacrifice to the Lord our God.\n(576.12, 578.48)  Yet I know that the King of Egypt\n(578.48, 582.96)  will not allow you to go unless he is forced.\n(582.96, 586.04)  I will stretch out my hand, therefore,\n(586.04, 591.64)  and smite Egypt by doing all kinds of wondrous deeds there.\n(591.64, 595.32)  After that, He will send you away.\n(595.32, 596.72)  The word of the Lord.\n(596.72, 598.72)  Thanks be to God.\n(598.72, 601.24)  The response of real Psalm.\n(601.24, 604.68)  The Lord remembers His covenant forever.\n(604.68, 608.04)  The Lord remembers His covenant forever.\n(608.04, 609.76)  Give thanks to the Lord.\n(609.76, 611.48)  Invoke His name.\n(611.48, 614.8)  Make known among the nations His deeds.\n(614.8, 619.56)  Recall the wondrous deeds that He has wrought, His portents,\n(619.56, 625.66)  and the judgments He has uttered.\n(625.66, 631.94)  He remembers forever His covenant, which He made binding for a thousand generations, which\n(631.94, 641.0)  He entered into with Abraham and by His oath to Isaac.\n(641.0, 647.06)  He greatly increased His people and made them stronger than their foes, whose hearts He\n(647.06, 654.06)  changed so that they hated his people and dealt deceitfully with his servants.\n(657.54, 664.54)  He sent Moses, his servant, Aaron, whom he had chosen. They wrought his signs among them\n(665.02, 672.02)  and wonders in the land of Ham.\n(677.06, 705.42)  Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.\n(705.42, 715.42)  Come to me, all you who labor and are burdened, and I will give you rest, says the Lord.\n(715.42, 724.42)  Alleluia, alleluia.\n(724.42, 727.42)  The Lord be with you.\n(727.42, 733.42)  A reading from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew.\n(733.42, 742.42)  Jesus said, Come to me, all you who label and are burdened, and I will give you rest.\n(742.42, 749.42)  Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am meek and humble of heart.\n(749.42, 758.42)  And you will find rest for yourself, for my yoke is easy and my burdened light.\n(758.42, 768.42)  The Gospel of the Lord.\n(768.42, 780.42)  In the reading today from the book of Exodus, we find the words go and assemble the elders\n(780.42, 787.42)  of Israel and tell them the Lord, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac\n(787.42, 794.42)  and Jacob, as it appeared to me and said, I am concerned about you.\n(797.0, 804.0)  Those words, my dear friends, though written so long ago in a certain circumstance, are\n(806.0, 813.0)  words that apply to you and to me as much as they did to those who heard them first.\n(815.52, 813.0) \n(825.36, 834.42)  I am concerned about you and in the gospel Jesus said come to me all you who labor and are burdened and I will give you rest. There's something very special I\n(834.42, 841.9)  think about the words we find today in the readings from Sacred Scripture. The\n(841.9, 845.18)  to focus upon the fact that Jesus,\n(845.18, 848.08)  who is our loving God and Father,\n(848.08, 850.66)  is as much concerned about us\n(851.7, 856.7)  as we go along the business of living life,\n(858.92, 863.6)  as indeed he was when these words were first spoken.\n(865.48, 868.68)  We are encouraged, I hope,\n(868.68, 873.68)  by the fact that he is with us in the ups and downs of life,\n(874.52, 877.36)  along the journey that we're traveling,\n(877.36, 880.12)  each of us with our different particular problems\n(880.12, 883.72)  and difficulties, joys and happiness,\n(883.72, 887.52)  to know that God himself is really\n(887.52, 891.12)  and truly concerned about us.\n(892.76, 896.48)  Perhaps we don't stop long enough and often enough\n(896.48, 907.88)  to reflect upon that fact, but the words today in the readings jump from the page as we reflect\n(907.88, 921.52)  upon them how blessed we are that our God is so concerned about each of us and how true\n(921.52, 926.44)  the words he spoke, come to me all you who are labored,\n(926.44, 931.0)  who labor and are burdened and I will give you rest.\n(932.64, 935.12)  We pray today for our deceased loved ones,\n(935.12, 938.4)  our benefactors, relatives and friends,\n(938.4, 941.88)  for those who have asked us for our prayers\n(941.88, 943.88)  and those for whom we may have forgotten,\n(943.88, 945.66)  let us pray to the Lord.\n(947.1, 949.24)  We pray for the special intention\n(949.24, 956.2)  which this Mass is being offered, let us pray to the Lord.\n(958.84, 962.76)  Pray for those who are sick and suffering and dying,\n(964.2, 969.48)  those in the local nursing homes and hospitals, for those who are\n(971.48, 975.96)  in need of our support and our prayer, let us pray to the Lord.\n(977.96, 975.96) \n(983.84, 991.08)  For an increase in vocations to the priesthood and religious life, particularly from among the families of our own parish, let us pray to the Lord.\n(991.08, 999.92)  For those who have no one else to pray for them except us, let us pray to the Lord.\n(999.92, 1004.96)  And for all our own personal needs and intentions today that we have kept quietly within our\n(1004.96, 1013.6)  hearts let us pray to the Lord oh God we ask you to hear these petitions and\n(1013.6, 1019.12)  requests of ours and to grant them if it is your will we ask all these things\n(1019.12, 1024.36)  through Jesus Christ our Lord\n(1034.96, 1064.94)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, but through your goodness we have received\n(1064.94, 1071.94)  the bread we offer you. Fruit of the earth and work of human hands, it will become for\n(1072.26, 1079.26)  us the bread of life. By the mystery of this water and wine, may we come to share in the\n(1080.98, 1087.98)  divinity of Christ, who humbles himself to share in our humanity.\n(1094.94, 1104.94)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through your goodness we have received the wine we offer you.\n(1104.94, 1112.94)  Fruit of the vine and work of human hands, it will become our spiritual drink.\n(1112.94, 1119.94)  With humble spirit and contrite heart, may we be accepted by you, O Lord,\n(1119.94, 1126.94)  and may our sacrifice in your sight this day be pleasing to you, Lord God.\n(1126.94, 1132.94)  Wash me, O Lord, from my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin.\n(1149.94, 1160.94)  Pray, brothers and sisters, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God, the Almighty Father.\n(1177.94, 1160.94) \n(1166.42, 1169.42)  May all men and men of God may pray to the Lord Jesus, our Lord and all the holy Church.\n(1178.42, 1182.42)  Look upon the offerings of the Church, O Lord,\n(1182.42, 1185.42)  as she makes her prayer to you,\n(1185.42, 1189.42)  and grant that when consumed by those who believe,\n(1189.42, 1194.42)  they may bring ever greater holiness through Christ our Lord.\n(1194.42, 1196.42)  The Lord be with you.\n(1196.42, 1199.42)  Lift up your heart.\n(1199.42, 1204.42)  Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.\n(1204.42, 1208.42)  It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,\n(1208.42, 1215.42)  always and everywhere to give you thanks, Lord Holy Father, Almighty and Eternal God.\n(1215.42, 1226.42)  For just as through your beloved Son you created the human race, so also through Him, with great goodness, you formed it anew.\n(1226.42, 1236.42)  And so it is right that all your creatures serve you, all the redeemed praise you, and all your saints with one heart bless you.\n(1236.42, 1244.42)  Therefore, we too extoll you with all the angels, as in joyful celebration we acclaim\n(1244.42, 1249.42)  Holy, Holy, Holy Lord, God of Hosts.\n(1249.42, 1254.42)  Heaven and earth are full of your glory, Hosanna in the highest.\n(1254.42, 1261.42)  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, Hosanna in the highest.\n(1261.42, 1267.42)  You are indeed holy, O Lord, the fount of all holiness.\n(1267.42, 1270.42)  Make holy, therefore, these gifts, we pray,\n(1270.42, 1275.42)  by sending down your Spirit upon them like the dewfall,\n(1275.42, 1282.42)  so that they may become for us the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.\n(1282.42, 1287.42)  At the time he was betrayed and entered willingly into his passion,\n(1287.42, 1293.42)  He took bread, and giving thanks, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying,\n(1293.42, 1303.42)  Take this, all of you, and eat of it, for this is my body which will be given up for you.\n(1317.42, 1325.42)  In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took the chalice, and once more giving thanks,\n(1325.42, 1331.42)  he gave it to his disciples, saying, Take this, all of you, and drink from it,\n(1331.42, 1339.42)  for this is the chalice of my blood, the blood of the new and eternal covenant,\n(1339.42, 1346.42)  which will be poured out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins.\n(1346.42, 1350.42)  Do this in memory of me.\n(1368.42, 1372.42)  The mystery of faith.\n(1372.42, 1382.42)  Save us, Savior of the world, for by your cross and resurrection you have set us free.\n(1382.42, 1387.42)  Therefore, as we celebrate the memorial of his death and resurrection,\n(1387.42, 1392.42)  we offer you, Lord, the bread of life and the chalice of salvation,\n(1392.42, 1400.42)  giving thanks that you have held us worthy to be in your presence and minister to you.\n(1400.42, 1410.42)  Humbly we pray that, partaking of the body and blood of Christ, we may be gathered into one by the Holy Spirit.\n(1410.42, 1429.42)  Remember, Lord, your Church, spread throughout the world, and bring her to the fullness of charity together with Leo, our Pope, and Richard, our Bishop, and all the clergy.\n(1429.42, 1442.42)  Remember also our brothers and sisters who have fallen asleep in the hope of the resurrection, and all who have died in your mercy.\n(1442.42, 1452.42)  Welcome them into the light of your face. Have mercy on us all, we pray, that with the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God,\n(1452.42, 1459.22)  God, with blessed Joseph, her spouse, with the blessed apostles, and all the saints who\n(1459.22, 1466.38)  have pleased you throughout the ages, we may merit to be co-heirs to eternal life and may\n(1466.38, 1474.42)  praise and glorify you through your Son, Jesus Christ.\n(1474.42, 1495.42)  Through him and with him and in him, O God, almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all glory and honor is yours forever and ever. Amen.\n(1495.42, 1503.18)  At the Saviour's command, informed by divine teaching, we dare to say, Our Father, who\n(1503.18, 1506.74)  art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.\n(1506.74, 1512.46)  Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.\n(1512.46, 1519.3)  Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who\n(1519.3, 1524.22)  trespass against us, and lead us not into temptation,\n(1524.22, 1527.14)  but deliver us from evil.\n(1527.14, 1530.74)  Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil.\n(1530.74, 1533.7)  Graciously grant peace in our days,\n(1533.7, 1536.62)  that by the help of your mercy, we\n(1536.62, 1541.62)  may be always free from sin and safe from all distress,\n(1541.62, 1544.86)  as we await the blessed hope and the coming\n(1544.86, 1549.26)  of our Savior, Jesus Christ.\n(1549.26, 1555.26)  Lord Jesus Christ, who said to your apostles,\n(1555.26, 1559.26)  Peace I leave you, my peace I give you,\n(1559.26, 1564.26)  look not on our sins, but on the faith of your Church,\n(1564.26, 1567.26)  and graciously grant her peace and unity\n(1567.26, 1569.26)  in accordance with your will,\n(1569.26, 1573.26)  who live and reign forever and ever.\n(1573.26, 1577.26)  The peace of the Lord be with you always.\n(1577.26, 1582.26)  Let us offer each other some sign of peace.\n(1595.26, 1600.26)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1600.26, 1606.26)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1606.26, 1612.26)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, grant us peace.\n(1612.26, 1618.26)  As always, we are mindful of the people who are with us in the celebration of the Eucharist\n(1618.26, 1631.26)  through the streaming system across the country and across the ocean and to other parts of the world.\n(1631.26, 1636.26)  They cannot receive Holy Communion in their homes, as we do here in the Church.\n(1636.26, 1644.26)  And so the Church wants us to always help them make a spiritual act of Holy Communion.\n(1644.26, 1649.26)  And we help ourselves as well, as we all pray together.\n(1649.26, 1658.26)  May the receiving of your body and blood, Lord Jesus Christ, not bring us to judgment and condemnation,\n(1658.26, 1667.26)  but through your loving mercy be for us protection in mind and body and a healing remedy.\n(1670.26, 1678.26)  Behold the Lamb of God. Behold him who takes away the sins of the world.\n(1678.26, 1683.26)  Blessed are those called through the supper of the Lamb.\n(1683.26, 1693.26)  God, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof but only say the word and my soul shall be healed.\n(1743.26, 1750.26)  The communion verse for today.\n(1760.34, 1767.34)  Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me and I in him, says the Lord.\n(1773.26, 1801.26)  the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ,\n(1801.26, 1813.74)  The body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ.\n(1813.74, 1823.22)  The body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ.\n(1823.22, 1830.7)  The body of Christ, the body of Christ.\n(1830.7, 1841.68)  The body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ,\n(1841.68, 1854.66)  the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ,\n(1854.66, 1856.14)  the body of Christ.\n(1980.7, 1991.98)  We ask you, as always, to please remember the priests at Regina Cleary and keep us in\n(1991.98, 2001.06)  your prayers, those who are sick and in the hospital at the moment, including my own brother,\n(2001.06, 2010.52)  and the other older priests who are unable to be out celebrating Mass the way I am able\n(2010.52, 2014.56)  to do, by God's grace.\n(2014.56, 2017.18)  We depend on you for our prayers,\n(2017.18, 2020.88)  and we thank you for remembering us.\n(2020.88, 2023.56)  And I thank you for coming to pray with us today.\n(2023.56, 2028.36)  I hope you have a good and a safe and a happy day.\n(2028.36, 2029.08)  Let us pray.\n(2034.52, 2037.36)  Having consumed these gifts, we pray,\n(2037.36, 2042.36)  O Lord, that by our participation in this mystery,\n(2042.36, 2047.36)  its saving effects upon us may grow through Christ our Lord.\n(2049.52, 2051.16)  The Lord be with you.\n(2052.7, 2056.38)  May the almighty God bless you in his kindness\n(2056.38, 2059.58)  and pour out saving wisdom upon you.\n(2059.58, 2063.38)  May he nourish you always with the teaching of your faith\n(2063.38, 2067.0)  and make you persevere in holy deeds, amen.\n(2067.36, 2075.36)  May he turn your steps toward himself and show you the path of charity and peace. Amen.\n(2075.36, 2082.36)  And may the blessing of Almighty God, the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit,\n(2082.36, 2087.36)  come down upon all of you and remain with you forever.\n(2087.36, 2090.36)  The Mass has ended.

Judah approached Joseph and said I beg you my\n(365.76, 372.12)  Lord let your servant speak earnestly to my Lord and do not become angry with\n(372.12, 379.28)  your servant for you are the equal of Pharaoh. My Lord asked your servants have\n(379.28, 385.64)  you a father or another brother? So we said to my lord, we have an aged father and a young\n(385.64, 392.64)  brother, the child of his old age. This one's full brother is dead, and since he is the\n(392.68, 399.68)  only one by that mother who has left, his father dotes on him. Then you told your servants,\n(401.04, 406.1)  bring him down to me that my eyes may look upon him. Unless your youngest brother comes\n(406.1, 413.1)  back with you. You shall not come into my presence again.\" When we returned to your\n(413.34, 420.34)  servant, our father, we reported to him the words of my Lord. Later, our father told us\n(421.7, 427.34)  to come back and buy food for the family, so we reminded him we cannot go back down\n(427.34, 433.84)  there. Only if our youngest brother is with us can we go, for we may not see the man if\n(433.84, 435.98)  if our youngest brother is not with us.\n(437.04, 439.64)  Then your servant, our father, said to us,\n(439.64, 442.6)  as you know, my wife bore me two sons.\n(443.52, 445.88)  One of them, however, disappeared,\n(445.88, 449.76)  and I had to conclude that he must have been torn to pieces\n(449.76, 451.72)  by wild beasts.\n(451.72, 453.42)  I have not seen him since.\n(454.44, 457.06)  If you now take this one away from me too,\n(457.06, 458.92)  and some disaster befalls him,\n(460.1, 462.24)  you will send my white head down\n(462.24, 465.74)  into the netherworld in grief.\n(465.74, 467.98)  Joseph could no longer control himself\n(467.98, 471.62)  in the presence of his attendants, so he cried out,\n(471.62, 474.74)  have everyone withdraw from me?\n(474.74, 476.82)  Thus no one was about when he made himself\n(476.82, 478.7)  known to his brothers.\n(478.7, 482.54)  But his sobs were so loud that the Egyptians heard him,\n(482.54, 486.06)  and so the news reached Pharaoh's Paris.\n(486.06, 488.54)  I am Joseph, he said to his brothers.\n(488.54, 492.5)  Is my father still in good health?\n(492.5, 497.66)  But his brothers could give him no answer, so dumbfathered were they at him.\n(497.66, 500.14)  Come closer to me, he told his brothers.\n(500.14, 506.3)  When they had done so, he said, I am your brother Joseph, whom you once sold into Egypt.\n(506.3, 512.02)  But now do not be distressed, and do not reproach yourselves for having sold me here.\n(512.02, 517.88)  It was really for the sake of saving lives that God sent me here ahead of you.\n(517.88, 529.08)  word of the Lord. Remember the marvels the Lord has done. When the Lord called\n(529.08, 533.96)  down a famine on the land and ruined the crops that sustained them, he sent a man\n(533.96, 538.68)  before them, Joseph, sold as a slave.\n(540.44, 546.38)  They had weighted him down with fetters and he was bound with chains till his\n(546.38, 554.78)  His prediction came to pass and the word of the Lord proved him true.\n(554.78, 557.54)  The king sent and released him.\n(557.54, 560.74)  The ruler of the people set him free.\n(560.74, 587.0)  For he made him Lord of his house\n(590.74, 598.4)  according to Matthew Jesus said to his apostles as you go make this\n(598.4, 603.9)  proclamation the kingdom of heaven is at hand cure the sick raise the dead\n(603.9, 609.22)  cleanse the lepers drive out demons without cost you have received without\n(609.22, 614.9)  cost you are to give do not take gold or silver or copper for your belts nor sack\n(614.9, 619.86)  for the journey or a second tunic or sandals or walking stick the laborer\n(619.86, 624.54)  Whatever deserves his keep, whatever town or village you enter, look for a worthy person\n(624.54, 627.46)  in it, and stay there until you leave.\n(627.46, 630.74)  As you enter a house, wish it peace.\n(630.74, 634.06)  If the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it.\n(634.06, 636.82)  If not, let your peace return to you.\n(636.82, 641.22)  Whoever will not receive you or listen to your words, go outside the house or town and\n(641.22, 642.94)  shake the dust from your feet.\n(642.94, 645.06)  Amen, I say to you.\n(645.06, 649.26)  It will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah on the Day of Judgment\n(649.26, 652.34)  than for that town, the gospel of the Lord.\n(657.7, 660.86)  The story of Joseph and his brothers gives us a model\n(660.86, 663.26)  to deal with what I think is one of the most difficult\n(663.26, 667.56)  crosses in life, which is the cross of being misunderstood\n(667.56, 672.18)  or betrayed or hurt at the hands of those closest to us.\n(672.18, 675.1)  The first thing we see from Joseph is that he feels\n(675.1, 681.02)  this pain very viscerally, very deeply. It's a mistake to think when we're\n(681.02, 686.26)  wronged or betrayed by those closest to us that it is somehow virtuous to just\n(686.26, 693.22)  pretend it doesn't affect us. Joseph cries, he weeps bitterly, but he does the\n(693.22, 698.58)  second thing which is the most important. He has a supernatural outlook on life. In\n(698.58, 705.42)  other words, he understands that what people may have meant for evil, God works\n(705.42, 711.7)  in means for the good. This does not take away the injustice at the hands of his\n(711.7, 719.46)  brothers, but Joseph sees that God in his goodness worked this pain for the\n(719.46, 726.06)  salvation of people. God works all of the things, even the betrayals and the hurt\n(726.06, 731.38)  in our life for the good. Today we would do well to examine our lives and to\n(731.38, 737.46)  think, is there any bitter resentments or obstacles that we\n(737.46, 741.9)  have in our life that are blocking grace? And maybe look at it with Joseph, maybe\n(741.9, 748.86)  we feel it viscerally so that we too can realize that God in His majesty can work\n(748.86, 753.5)  even this pain for the good. And so let us stand and make our petitions known\n(753.5, 758.54)  for the Heavenly Father. We pray for Pope Leo and for Bishop Richard Henning and\n(758.54, 762.76)  for all bishops throughout the church. May God give them the grace to be true\n(762.76, 766.64)  shepherds of souls so all can come to know the love of Christ. We pray to the\n(766.64, 773.08)  Lord. We pray for all civil leaders, governments, and elected officials\n(773.08, 776.52)  throughout the world. May they enact policies that protect the church and\n(776.52, 780.26)  give her the freedom to be herself so the kingdom of God can be spread to\n(780.26, 785.34)  every corner of the globe. We pray to the Lord. We pray for an increase of\n(785.34, 789.06)  vocations to the priesthood and to the religious life, especially from members\n(789.06, 794.76)  from our own parishes and our own families. We pray to the Lord. We pray\n(794.76, 800.5)  for our parishioners for whom this mass is offered. We pray to the Lord. Heavenly\n(800.5, 804.06)  Father, we make these prayers with great confidence as we ask them through the\n(804.06, 808.06)  intercession of Mary, our morning star and gate of heaven, and we speak them in\n(808.06, 813.14)  the name of Jesus, her son, who is Lord forever and ever.\n(868.06, 897.58)  Pray, brothers and sisters, that my sacrifice\n(897.58, 910.02)  and yours may be acceptable to God the Almighty Father may this oblation\n(910.02, 915.94)  dedicated to your name purify us O Lord and day by day bring our conduct closer\n(915.94, 922.98)  to the life of heaven through Christ our Lord the Lord be with you lift up your\n(922.98, 930.5)  hearts. Let us give thanks to the Lord our God. It is truly right and just, our duty\n(930.5, 934.78)  and our salvation, always and everywhere to give you thanks, Lord, Holy Father,\n(934.78, 939.6)  Almighty and eternal God. For although you have no need of our praise, yet our\n(939.6, 944.02)  thanksgiving is itself your gift. Since our praises add nothing to your greatness,\n(944.02, 949.3)  but profit us for salvation through Christ our Lord. And so, in company with\n(949.3, 955.42)  with the choirs of angels we praise you and with joy we proclaim holy holy holy\n(955.42, 960.02)  Lord God of hosts heaven and earth are full of your glory\n(960.02, 965.38)  Hosanna in the highest blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord\n(965.38, 972.18)  Hosanna in the highest to you therefore most merciful father we make humble\n(972.18, 976.34)  prayer in petition through Jesus Christ your son our Lord that you accept and\n(976.34, 982.9)  And bless these gifts, these offerings, these holy and blemished sacrifices, which we offer\n(982.9, 985.46)  you firstly for your holy Catholic Church.\n(985.46, 990.14)  Be pleased to grant her peace, to guard, unite, and govern her throughout the whole world,\n(990.14, 994.94)  together with your servant Leo, our Pope, and Richard, our Bishop, and all those who,\n(994.94, 999.34)  holding to the truth, hand on the Catholic and Apostolic faith.\n(999.34, 1005.56)  Remember, Lord, your servings.\n(1005.56, 1008.6)  and all gathered here whose faith and devotion are known to you.\n(1008.6, 1010.8)  For them we offer you this sacrifice of praise,\n(1010.8, 1012.56)  for they offer it for themselves,\n(1012.56, 1013.96)  and all who are dear to them,\n(1013.96, 1015.76)  for the redemption of their souls,\n(1015.76, 1017.6)  and hope of health and well-being,\n(1017.6, 1018.84)  and paying their homage to you,\n(1018.84, 1021.06)  the eternal God, living and true,\n(1021.06, 1023.64)  in communion with those whose memory we venerate,\n(1023.64, 1025.76)  especially the glorious ever Virgin Mary,\n(1025.76, 1028.32)  Mother of our God and Lord Jesus Christ,\n(1028.32, 1030.32)  and blessed Joseph, her spouse,\n(1030.32, 1032.32)  your blessed apostles and martyrs,\n(1032.32, 1035.32)  Peter and Paul, Andrew, James, John,\n(1035.32, 1041.64)  Thomas, James, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Simon, and Jude, Linus, Cletus, Clemens, Sixtus, Cornelius,\n(1042.08, 1044.6)  Cyprian, Lawrence, Chrysogonus, John, and Paul,\n(1045.04, 1049.88)  Cosmas, and Damian, and all your saints. We ask that through their merits and prayers and all things\n(1050.04, 1052.72)  we may be defended by your protecting help.\n(1055.72, 1060.44)  Therefore, Lord, we pray graciously accept this oblation of our service, that of your whole family.\n(1061.0, 1060.44) \n(1064.94, 1069.16)  O family, order our days in your peace and command that we be delivered from eternal damnation and counted among the flock of those you have chosen.\n(1069.16, 1075.44)  Be pleased, O God, we pray, to bless, acknowledge, and approve this offering in every respect.\n(1075.44, 1080.1)  Make it spiritual and acceptable so that it may become for us the body and blood of your\n(1080.1, 1083.96)  most beloved Son, our Lord Jesus Christ.\n(1083.96, 1089.88)  the day before he was to suffer he took bread in his holy and venerable hands\n(1089.88, 1095.4)  and with eyes raised to heaven to you O God his Almighty Father giving you\n(1095.4, 1099.84)  thanks he said the blessing broke the bread and gave it to his disciples\n(1099.84, 1109.9)  saying take this all of you and eat of it for this is my body which will be\n(1109.9, 1129.66)  given up for you in a similar way when supper was ended he took this precious\n(1129.66, 1134.58)  chalice in his holy and venerable hands and once more giving you thanks he said\n(1134.58, 1141.86)  the blessing and gave the chalice to his disciples saying take this all of you\n(1141.86, 1148.42)  and drink from it for this is the chalice of my blood the blood of the new\n(1148.42, 1152.9)  and eternal covenant which will be poured out for you and for many for the\n(1152.9, 1159.46)  forgiveness of sins do this in memory of me\n(1164.58, 1178.66)  The mystery of faith. Save us, Savior of the world. For by your cross and resurrection,\n(1178.66, 1184.3)  you have set us free. Therefore, O Lord, as we celebrate the memorial of the blessed Passion,\n(1184.3, 1188.16)  the resurrection from the dead and the glorious ascension into heaven of Christ your Son our\n(1188.16, 1193.5)  Lord, we your servants and your holy people offer to your glorious majesty from the gifts\n(1193.5, 1198.78)  that you have given us, this pure victim, this holy victim, this spotless victim, the\n(1198.78, 1203.44)  holy bread of eternal life and the chalice of everlasting salvation. Be pleased to look\n(1203.44, 1208.46)  upon these offerings with a serene and kindly countenance, and to accept them, as once you\n(1208.46, 1214.0)  were pleased to accept the gifts of your servant Abel the Just, the sacrifice of Abraham our\n(1214.0, 1219.58)  father in faith, and the offering of your high priest Melchizedek, a holy sacrifice,\n(1219.58, 1224.38)  spotless victim and humble prayer we ask you Almighty God, command that these\n(1224.38, 1228.94)  gifts be borne by the hands of your holy angel to your altar on high in the sight\n(1228.94, 1233.22)  of your divine majesty so that all of us who through this participation at the\n(1233.22, 1237.5)  altar receive the most holy body and blood of your son may be filled with\n(1237.5, 1243.74)  every grace and heavenly blessing. Remember also Lord your servants who\n(1243.74, 1245.72)  who have gone before us with a sign of faith\n(1245.72, 1247.9)  and rest in the sleep of peace.\n(1250.82, 1253.42)  Grant them, O Lord, we pray, and all who sleep in Christ,\n(1253.42, 1256.18)  a place of refreshment, light, and peace.\n(1256.18, 1258.78)  To us also your servants who those sinners,\n(1258.78, 1260.54)  hope in your abundant mercies,\n(1260.54, 1262.62)  graciously grants them share and fellowship\n(1262.62, 1264.6)  with your holy apostles and martyrs,\n(1264.6, 1267.92)  with John the Baptist, Stephen, Matthias, Barnabas,\n(1267.92, 1272.44)  Ignatius, Alexander, Marcellinus, Peter, Felicity, Perpetua,\n(1272.44, 1275.22)  Agatha, Lucy, Agnes, Cecilia, Anastasia,\n(1275.22, 1276.58)  and all your saints.\n(1276.58, 1278.86)  Admit us we beseech you into their company,\n(1278.86, 1281.58)  not weighing our merits, but granting us your pardon.\n(1281.58, 1283.04)  Through Christ our Lord,\n(1283.04, 1285.18)  through whom you continue to make all these good things,\n(1285.18, 1288.58)  oh Lord, you sanctify them, fill them with life,\n(1288.58, 1291.02)  bless them, and bestow them upon us.\n(1293.34, 1295.78)  Through him, and with him, and in him,\n(1295.78, 1299.78)  oh God, almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\n(1299.78, 1308.34)  glory and honor is yours, forever and ever. At the Savior's command, informed by\n(1308.34, 1314.34)  divine teaching, we dare to say, Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be\n(1314.34, 1320.7)  thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us\n(1320.7, 1326.72)  this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who\n(1326.72, 1332.36)  trust pass against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil.\n(1332.36, 1337.64)  Deliver us Lord we pray from every evil graciously grant peace in our days that\n(1337.64, 1341.68)  by the help of your mercy we may be always free from sin and safe from all\n(1341.68, 1348.24)  distress as we await the blessed hope in the coming of our Savior Jesus Christ.\n(1350.24, 1354.8)  Lord Jesus Christ who said to your apostles peace I leave you my peace I\n(1354.8, 1359.08)  give you. Look not in our sins but on the faith of your church and graciously\n(1359.08, 1362.72)  grant her peace and unity in accordance with your will. Live and reign forever\n(1362.72, 1368.48)  and ever. The peace of the Lord be with you always. Let us offer each other the\n(1368.48, 1377.44)  sign of peace. Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world. Have mercy on us.\n(1377.44, 1383.48)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world. Have mercy on us. Lamb of God,\n(1383.48, 1388.96)  God, you take away the sins of the world.

Judah approached Joseph and said I beg you my Lord\n(399.18, 406.22)  let your servant speak earnestly to my Lord and do not become angry with your servant for you\n(406.22, 409.22)  You are the equal of Pharaoh.\n(409.22, 414.22)  My Lord asked your servants, Have you a father or another brother?\n(414.22, 422.22)  So we said to my Lord, We have an aged father and a young brother, the child of his old\n(422.22, 423.22)  age.\n(423.22, 430.78)  This one's full brother is dead, and since he is the only one by that mother who is left,\n(430.78, 433.98)  his father dotes on him.\n(433.98, 440.34)  Then you told your servants, bring him down to me that my eyes may look on him.\n(440.34, 447.34)  Unless your youngest brother comes back with you, you shall not commit to my presence again.\n(447.34, 454.66)  When we returned to your servant, our father, we reported to him the words of my lord.\n(454.66, 461.5)  Later, our father told us to come back and buy some food for the family, so we reminded\n(461.5, 468.5)  him. We cannot go down there. Only if our youngest brother is with us can we go, for\n(468.66, 475.66)  we may not see the man if our youngest brother is not with us. Then your servant, our father,\n(475.66, 482.66)  said to us, as you know, my wife bore me two sons. One of them, however, disappeared, and\n(484.46, 491.14)  I had to conclude that he must have been torn to pieces by wild beasts. I have not seen\n(491.14, 498.14)  him sense. If you now take this one away from me too, and some disaster befalls him, he\n(499.14, 506.14)  will send my white head down to the netherworld in grief. Joseph could no longer control himself\n(506.76, 512.86)  in the presence of all his attendants, so he cried out, Have everyone withdraw from\n(512.86, 519.86)  me. Thus no one else was about when he made himself known to his brothers. But his sobs\n(520.6, 519.86) \n(526.06, 528.06)  But his sobs were so loud that the Egyptians heard him, and so the news reached Pharaoh's palace.\n(528.06, 534.5)  I am Joseph, he said to his brothers, is my father still in good health?\n(534.5, 540.82)  But his brothers could give him no answer, so dumbfounded were they at him.\n(540.82, 543.74)  Come closer to me, he told his brothers.\n(543.74, 551.14)  When they had done so, he said, I am your brother Joseph, whom you sold into Egypt.\n(551.14, 557.8)  But now do not be distressed, and do not reproach yourselves for having sold me here.\n(557.8, 564.44)  It was really for the sake of saving lives that God sent me here ahead of you.\"\n(564.44, 569.46)  The Word of the Lord.\n(569.46, 578.36)  The response, a surreal psalm, remember the marvels the Lord has done.\n(578.36, 584.18)  When the Lord called down a famine on the land and ruined the crop that sustained them,\n(584.18, 592.14)  he sent a man before them, Joseph, sold as a slave.\n(592.14, 598.16)  They had weighed him down with fetters, and he was bound with chains, till his prediction\n(598.16, 606.48)  came to pass, and the word of the Lord proved him true.\n(606.48, 609.0)  The king sent and released him.\n(609.0, 612.52)  The ruler of the peoples set him free.\n(612.52, 636.04)  He made him Lord of his health and ruler of all his possessions.\n(636.04, 637.56)  The Lord be with you.\n(637.56, 645.48)  reading from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew. Jesus said to his apostles as\n(645.48, 650.72)  you go make this proclamation the kingdom of heaven is at hand cure the\n(650.72, 656.32)  sick raise the dead cleanse the lepers strive out demons without cost you have\n(656.32, 661.84)  received without cost you are to give do not take gold or silver or copper for\n(661.84, 667.24)  your belts nor sack for the journey or a second tunic or sandals or walking stick\n(667.24, 672.56)  the laborer deserves his keep whatever town or village you enter look for a\n(672.56, 677.8)  worthy person in it and stay there until you leave as you enter a house wish it\n(677.8, 683.56)  peace if the house is worthy let your peace come upon it if not let your peace\n(683.56, 689.64)  return to you whoever will not receive you or listen to your words go outside\n(689.64, 695.4)  that house or town and shake the dust from your feet amen I say to you it will\n(695.4, 700.24)  will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for\n(700.24, 701.68)  that town.\n(701.68, 708.16)  The Gospel of the Lord.\n(708.16, 714.0)  The story of betrayal that Joseph receives at the hands of his brothers is one that is\n(714.0, 719.28)  definitely worth contemplating because it teaches us about the importance of forgiveness\n(719.28, 722.36)  and how it also comes in stages.\n(722.36, 728.62)  We see from Joseph, who is wrong at the hands of those closest to him, that he doesn't just\n(728.62, 731.36)  pretend it doesn't bother him.\n(731.36, 734.0)  We hear that he actually sobs.\n(734.0, 738.8)  He feels this betrayal very deeply and very viscerally.\n(738.8, 746.26)  That is the first step in healing and receiving and giving the forgiveness that God calls.\n(746.26, 751.48)  It's from there, from grappling with this real hurt, that Joseph has a supernatural\n(751.48, 758.6)  outlook he says this it was really for the sake of saving lives that God sent\n(758.6, 763.72)  me here ahead of you the next line that Joseph will say is what you meant for\n(763.72, 770.8)  evil God meant for good the Lord works even our betrayals the\n(770.8, 775.48)  detractions the being misunderstood in our lives when we surrender it over to\n(775.48, 780.6)  him he works in orders that all to the good but at the same time that doesn't\n(780.6, 786.36)  mean that there wasn't an injustice done to us and that we shouldn't feel the pain and the hurt,\n(787.08, 793.88)  but it's so easy to stop there and to harbor that resentment instead of to see that the Lord\n(794.52, 800.92)  can actually work everything and He does work everything for the good and for the salvation\n(800.92, 806.76)  of even those who have hurt us. And so today we would do well with Joseph to examine our lives\n(806.76, 810.84)  and to ask where are those places where we've experienced hurt\n(810.84, 815.24)  that the Lord can shine his light upon and that he can work those\n(815.24, 818.6)  even those dark places for the good for those\n(818.6, 822.76)  and all those around us and so let us stand and make our petitions\n(822.76, 827.72)  known to our Heavenly Father. We pray for Pope Leo and for Bishop Richard\n(827.72, 830.28)  Henning and for all bishops throughout the church.\n(830.28, 833.56)  May God give him the grace to be true shepherds of souls\n(833.56, 839.08)  who show us the power and healing of forgiveness. We pray to the Lord.\n(839.08, 842.28)  We pray for all civil leaders, governments, and elected officials\n(842.28, 845.32)  throughout the world. May they enact policies that protect the\n(845.32, 849.16)  church and give her the freedom to be herself so the kingdom of God can be\n(849.16, 854.76)  spread to every corner of the globe. We pray to the Lord. We pray for an\n(854.76, 858.52)  increase of vocations to the priesthood and to the religious life,\n(858.52, 862.12)  especially for members from our own parishes and our own families.\n(862.12, 868.2)  May God call many men and women to give their lives entirely to him to be instruments of his mercy,\n(868.2, 874.68)  forgiveness, and healing. We pray to the Lord. We pray for our beloved dead, especially for\n(874.68, 879.8)  Abruvalette Leon-Lissette for whom this mass is offered. Through the mercy of God and with the\n(879.8, 887.08)  help of our prayers, may come to see Christ face to face. We pray to the Lord. Heavenly Father,\n(887.08, 891.4)  we make these prayers with great confidence as we ask them for the intercession of Mary,\n(891.4, 895.0)  our morning star and gate of heaven and we speak them in the name of Jesus her\n(895.0, 899.28)  son who was Lord forever and ever.\n(951.4, 953.4)  .\n(981.4, 987.4)  Pray, brothers and sisters, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God, the Almighty\n(987.4, 996.7)  Father.\n(996.7, 1003.2)  May this oblation, dedicated to your name, purify us, O Lord, and day by day bring our\n(1003.2, 1008.88)  conduct closer to the life of heaven, through Christ our Lord.\n(1008.88, 1018.24)  Lord be with you. Lift up your hearts. Let us give thanks to the Lord our God. It is\n(1018.24, 1022.28)  truly right and just our duty and our salvation always and everywhere to give\n(1022.28, 1027.52)  you thanks. Lord holy Father almighty and eternal God. For in goodness you created\n(1027.52, 1032.32)  man and when he was justly condemned in mercy you redeemed him through Christ our\n(1032.32, 1036.96)  Lord. Through him the angels praise your majesty. Dominion to door and powers\n(1036.96, 1042.24)  tremble before you heaven in the virtues of heaven and the blessed seraphim worship together with\n(1042.24, 1050.48)  exaltation may our voices we pray join with theirs and humble praise as we acclaim holy holy holy\n(1050.48, 1058.16)  lord god hosts heaven and earth are full of your glory ozonna in the highest blessed is he who\n(1058.16, 1065.92)  comes in the name of the lord ozonna in the highest you are indeed holy oh lord and all\n(1065.92, 1071.52)  you have created rightly gives you praise for through your son our Lord Jesus Christ by the\n(1071.52, 1076.96)  power and working of the Holy Spirit you give life to all things and make them holy and you never\n(1076.96, 1082.56)  cease to gather a people to yourself so that from the rising of the sun to its setting a pure\n(1082.56, 1089.44)  sacrifice may be offered to your name therefore oh Lord we humbly implore you by the same spirit\n(1089.44, 1094.32)  graciously make holy these gifts we have brought to you for consecration that they may become the\n(1094.32, 1100.52)  body and blood your son our Lord Jesus Christ at whose command we celebrate\n(1100.52, 1106.36)  these mysteries for on the night he was betrayed he himself took bread and\n(1106.36, 1111.24)  giving you thanks he said the blessing broke the bread and gave it to his\n(1111.24, 1121.44)  disciples saying take this all of you and eat of it for this is my body which\n(1121.44, 1138.18)  which will be given up for you.\n(1138.18, 1144.1)  In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took the chalice, and giving you thanks he\n(1144.1, 1151.22)  said the blessing and gave the chalice to his disciples saying take this all of\n(1151.22, 1158.04)  you and drink from it for this is the chalice of my blood the blood of the new\n(1158.04, 1162.34)  and eternal covenant which will be poured out for you and for many for the\n(1162.34, 1168.82)  forgiveness of sins do this in memory of me\n(1174.1, 1188.52)  the mystery of faith save us savior of the world for by your cross and\n(1188.52, 1193.68)  resurrection you have set us free therefore Oh Lord as we celebrate the\n(1193.68, 1197.64)  memorial of the saving passion of your son his wondrous resurrection and\n(1197.64, 1201.88)  ascension into heaven and as we look forward to a second coming we offer you\n(1201.88, 1205.8)  in thanksgiving this holy and living sacrifice.

        "transcript": "(176.0, 183.0)  So, thank you very much for joining us today, and we'll see you in the next session.\n(266.0, 294.72)  As He walked by the Sea of Galilee,\n(294.72, 299.72)  Jesus saw James, the son of Zebedee, and John, his brother, mending their nets, and he called\n(299.72, 300.72)  them.\n(300.72, 307.1)  In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, the Lord be with you.\n(307.1, 310.88)  Today's Mass is offered for the repose of the soul of Margaret Baxter, and we celebrate\n(310.88, 313.52)  the Feast of St. James, Apostle.\n(313.52, 317.64)  My brothers and sisters, let us acknowledge our sins and so prepare ourselves to celebrate\n(317.64, 320.88)  the sacred mysteries.\n(320.88, 327.78)  I confess to Almighty God and to you, my brothers and sisters, that I have greatly sinned in\n(327.78, 333.26)  my thoughts and in my words and what I have done and what I have failed to do through\n(333.26, 338.08)  my fault, through my fault, through my most grievous fault.\n(338.08, 343.68)  Therefore I ask the Blessed Mary of a Virgin, all the angels and saints, and you, my brothers\n(343.68, 347.36)  and sisters, to pray for me to the Lord our God.\n(347.36, 353.16)  May almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us our sins and bring us to everlasting life.\n(353.16, 360.68)  Lord have mercy, Christ have mercy, Lord have mercy.\n(360.68, 365.12)  Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace to people of good will.\n(365.12, 371.36)  We praise you, we bless you, we adore you, we glorify you, we give you thanks for your\n(371.36, 372.98)  great glory.\n(372.98, 380.58)  God, Heavenly King, O God Almighty Father, Lord Jesus Christ, Only Begotten Son, Lord\n(380.58, 386.62)  God, Lamb of God, Son of the Father, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on\n(386.62, 392.94)  us. You take away the sins of the world, receive our prayer. You are seated at the right hand\n(392.94, 399.62)  of the Father, have mercy on us. For you alone are the Holy One, you alone are the Lord,\n(399.62, 404.66)  alone are the Most High, Jesus Christ, with the Holy Spirit and the glory of\n(404.66, 410.74)  God the Father. Amen. Let us pray.\n(411.1, 416.66)  Almighty ever-living God, who consecrated the first fruits of your apostles by the\n(416.66, 421.76)  blood of St. James, grant, we pray, that your church may be strengthened by his\n(421.76, 426.86)  confession of faith and constantly sustained by his protection. Through our\n(426.86, 430.98)  Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy\n(430.98, 435.34)  Spirit, God, for ever and ever.\n(447.74, 453.38)  A reading from the second letter of Saint Paul to the Corinthians. Brothers\n(453.38, 457.88)  Brothers and sisters, we hold this treasure in earth and vessels, that the surpassing\n(457.88, 461.12)  power may be of God and not from us.\n(461.12, 468.44)  We are afflicted in every way, but not constrained, perplexed but not driven to despair, persecuted\n(468.44, 474.68)  but not abandoned, struck down but not destroyed, always carrying about in the body the dying\n(474.68, 480.28)  of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our body.\n(480.28, 485.14)  For we who live are constantly being given up to death for the sake of Jesus, so that\n(485.14, 489.14)  the life of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh.\n(489.14, 492.5)  So death is at work in us, but life in you.\n(492.5, 495.1)  Since then we have the same spirit of faith.\n(495.1, 499.58)  According to what is written, I believed, therefore I spoke.\n(499.58, 504.28)  We too believe and therefore speak, knowing that the one who raised the Lord Jesus will\n(504.28, 509.4)  raise us also with Jesus and place us with you in his presence.\n(509.4, 513.36)  Everything indeed is for you, so that the grace bestowed in abundance on more and more\n(513.36, 518.18)  people may cause the thanksgiving to overflow for the glory of God.\n(518.18, 522.24)  The word of the Lord.\n(522.24, 529.28)  Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.\n(529.28, 533.56)  When the Lord brought back the captives of Zion, we were like men dreaming.\n(533.56, 541.82)  Then our mouth was filled with laughter, and our tongue with rejoicing.\n(541.82, 545.96)  Then they said among the nations, The Lord has done great things for them.\n(545.96, 548.12)  The Lord has done great things for us.\n(548.12, 554.76)  We are glad indeed.\n(554.76, 559.28)  Restore our fortunes, O Lord, like the torrents in the southern desert.\n(559.28, 566.28)  Those that sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.\n(566.28, 569.92)  Although they go forth weeping, carrying the seed to be sown,\n(569.92, 572.92)  they shall come back rejoicing, carrying their sheaves.\n(589.28, 600.36)  the Lord be with you a reading from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew the\n(600.36, 604.04)  mother of the sons of Zebedee approached Jesus with her sons and did him homage\n(604.04, 610.08)  wishing to ask him for something he said to her what do you wish she answered him\n(610.08, 614.6)  command that these two sons of mine stood at one at your right and the other\n(614.6, 619.64)  at your left in your kingdom. Jesus said in reply, You do not know what you are\n(619.64, 625.04)  asking. Can you drink the chalice that I am going to drink? They said to him, We\n(625.04, 631.0)  can. He replied, My chalice you will indeed drink, but to sit at my right and\n(631.0, 635.92)  at my left this is not mine to give, but is for those for\n(635.92, 640.6)  whom it has been prepared by my Father. When the ten heard this they became\n(640.6, 645.58)  indignant at the two brothers but Jesus summoned them and said you know that the\n(645.58, 649.78)  rulers of the Gentiles lorded over them and the great ones make their authority\n(649.78, 655.42)  over them felt but it shall not be so among you rather whoever wishes to be\n(655.42, 660.34)  great among you shall be your servant whoever wishes to be first among you\n(660.34, 665.56)  shall be your slave just so the Son of Man did not come to be served but to\n(665.56, 669.46)  to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many.\n(669.46, 670.7)  The gospel of the Lord.\n(670.7, 675.62)  Praise be to the Lord Jesus Christ.\n(675.62, 677.98)  Today, tens of thousands of pilgrims\n(677.98, 682.66)  will arrive to the cathedral in Compostela Santiago in Spain\n(682.66, 684.58)  as they complete their pilgrimage,\n(684.58, 687.86)  walking the way of St. James to pay veneration\n(687.86, 691.38)  to this apostle, who was the very first of the apostles\n(691.38, 694.94)  to be martyred on the year 44 AD.\n(694.94, 698.5)  So very shortly after Jesus's resurrection.\n(698.5, 701.44)  And devotion to St. James is important for us\n(701.44, 702.48)  for two reasons.\n(702.48, 705.98)  The first is that we see that James,\n(705.98, 707.98)  much like the other apostles,\n(707.98, 710.54)  was not a perfect person\n(710.54, 713.08)  or a perfect instrument of the Lord.\n(713.08, 715.18)  In fact, he was very impetuous.\n(715.18, 717.14)  This is why he got the name, the son,\n(717.14, 719.98)  and with his brother, the son of thunder.\n(719.98, 722.3)  But this weakness did not scare Jesus.\n(722.3, 726.46)  In fact, this is precisely why he called him.\n(726.46, 728.52)  And the same is true with us.\n(728.52, 731.44)  The Lord makes use of very broken instruments.\n(731.44, 734.6)  And what we should realize is there is a big difference\n(734.6, 738.04)  between the James that died for the faith\n(738.04, 741.2)  and the James that heard the very first call\n(741.2, 743.32)  on the shores of Galilee.\n(743.32, 745.32)  And what would led to his change?\n(745.32, 748.84)  Just walking with the Lord, spending time with him.\n(748.84, 751.52)  And so the same is true for all of us who,\n(751.52, 754.48)  including me, are beginners in the spiritual life.\n(754.48, 757.92)  We can't get overwhelmed by setbacks or our shortcomings\n(757.92, 759.6)  in our own personality,\n(759.6, 763.28)  because the Lord purifies that over time.\n(763.28, 767.4)  And there's a big difference between how we start\n(767.4, 769.32)  and please God where we finish.\n(769.32, 771.62)  And then last and most important,\n(771.62, 775.48)  we see that there is no glory in the kingdom of God\n(775.48, 778.4)  without willingly accepting suffering.\n(779.32, 778.4) \n(783.28, 786.48)  James is invited to drink of the chalice of Jesus. This is super important to understand\n(786.48, 790.48)  because the world tries to do everything it can\n(790.48, 794.92)  to get rid of suffering, whether interiorly or physically.\n(795.76, 798.72)  And Jesus suffers with us.\n(798.72, 803.04)  We don't drink an empty chalice, we share in the Lord's.\n(803.04, 806.24)  And when we start to see our sufferings as not our own,\n(806.24, 808.64)  but we're in union with the passion,\n(808.64, 810.68)  death, and resurrection of Jesus,\n(810.68, 813.0)  this suffering becomes redemptive,\n(813.0, 815.6)  and then the life of Christ breathes through us\n(815.6, 817.2)  for the world to see.\n(817.2, 819.84)  And so today we give thanks for the witness\n(819.84, 823.76)  of the first martyr who changed by walking with Christ,\n(823.76, 826.04)  because through his witness and his example,\n(826.04, 827.3)  we can as well.\n(827.3, 829.56)  And so let us make our petitions known\n(829.56, 830.96)  to our Heavenly Father.\n(831.96, 834.7)  We pray for Pope Leo and for Bishop Richard Henning,\n(834.7, 836.82)  And for all bishops throughout the church,\n(836.82, 840.02)  may God give him the grace to be true shepherds of souls\n(840.02, 842.92)  who model how to suffer well with the Lord.\n(842.92, 844.22)  We pray to the Lord.\n(846.22, 848.38)  We pray for all civil leaders, governments,\n(848.38, 850.14)  and elected officials throughout the world.\n(850.14, 852.46)  May they enact policies that protect the church\n(852.46, 854.22)  and give her the freedom to be herself\n(854.22, 855.94)  so the kingdom of God can be spread\n(855.94, 857.32)  to every corner of the globe.\n(857.32, 858.52)  We pray to the Lord.\n(859.94, 862.5)  We pray for an increase of vocations to the priesthood\n(862.5, 863.94)  and to the religious life,\n(863.94, 866.1)  especially for members from our own parishes\n(866.1, 867.46)  and our own families.\n(867.46, 869.42)  May God call many men and women\n(869.42, 871.46)  to follow the example of St. James\n(871.46, 873.58)  and live their lives entirely for God.\n(873.58, 874.76)  We pray to the Lord.\n(876.46, 879.18)  And we pray for the repose of the soul of Margaret Baxter\n(879.18, 881.76)  for whom this mass is offered through the mercy of God\n(881.76, 883.34)  and the help of our prayers.\n(883.34, 885.66)  May she come to see Christ face to face.\n(885.66, 887.0)  We pray to the Lord.\n(888.82, 891.82)  Heavenly Father, we make these prayers with great confidence\n(891.82, 894.38)  as we ask them through the intercession of Saint James\n(894.38, 896.82)  and Mary, our morning star and gate of heaven.\n(896.82, 899.18)  And we speak them in the name of Jesus, her son,\n(899.18, 901.38)  who is Lord forever and ever, amen.\n(951.82, 981.02)  Pray, brothers and sisters, that my sacrifice is for you, for you, for you, for you, for\n(981.02, 994.02)  my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God the Almighty Father cleanse us\n(994.02, 998.42)  Lord by the saving baptism of your son's passion so that on the Feast of St.\n(998.42, 1003.38)  James whom you will to be the first among the Apostles to drink of Christ's\n(1003.38, 1008.74)  chalice of suffering we may offer a sacrifice pleasing to you through Christ\n(1008.74, 1016.74)  our Lord the Lord be with you lift up your hearts let us give thanks to the\n(1016.74, 1022.9)  Lord our God it is truly right and just our duty and our salvation always and\n(1022.9, 1027.64)  everywhere to give you thanks Lord Holy Father Almighty and eternal God for you\n(1027.64, 1031.46)  eternal Shepherd do not desert your flock but through the Blessed Apostles\n(1031.46, 1036.46)  watch over it and protect it always so that it may be governed by those you\n(1036.46, 1041.06)  appointed shepherds, to lead it in the name of your Son. And so with angels and\n(1041.06, 1045.22)  archangels, with thrones and dominions, and with all the hosts and powers of\n(1045.22, 1051.42)  heaven, we sing the hymn of your glory, as without end we acclaim. Holy, holy, holy,\n(1051.42, 1056.3)  Lord God of hosts, heaven and earth are full of your glory.\n(1056.3, 1061.46)  Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.\n(1061.46, 1068.42)  Hosanna in the highest. To you, therefore, most merciful Father, we make humble\n(1068.42, 1072.72)  prayer petition through Jesus Christ your Son our Lord, that you accept and\n(1072.72, 1078.74)  bless these gifts, these offerings, these holy and blemished sacrifices, which we\n(1078.74, 1083.46)  offer you firstly for your holy Catholic Church. Be pleased to grant her peace, to\n(1083.46, 1086.98)  guard, unite, and govern her throughout the whole world, together with your\n(1086.98, 1091.5)  servant Leo, our Pope, and Richard, our Bishop, and all those who holding to the\n(1091.5, 1101.26)  truth hand on the Catholic and Apostolic faith. Remember, Lord, your servants, and\n(1101.26, 1105.38)  all gathered here whose faith and devotion are known to you. For them we\n(1105.38, 1108.98)  offer you the sacrifice of praise, so they offer it for themselves, and all\n(1108.98, 1112.74)  who are dear to them, for the redemption of their souls, and hope of health and\n(1112.74, 1116.7)  well-being and paying their homage to you the eternal God living and true in\n(1116.7, 1120.92)  communion with those whose memory we venerate especially the glorious ever\n(1120.92, 1125.36)  Virgin Mary mother of our God and Lord Jesus Christ and blessed Joseph her\n(1125.36, 1131.84)  spouse your blessed apostles and martyrs Peter and Paul Andrew James John Thomas\n(1131.84, 1137.16)  James Philip Bartholomew Bartholomew Matthew Simon and Jude Linus Cletus\n(1137.16, 1141.76)  Clemens Sixtus Cornelius Cyprian Lawrence Chrysogonus John and Paul\n(1141.76, 1146.0)  Cosmas and Damian and all your saints. We ask that through their merits and\n(1146.0, 1152.8)  prayers in all things we may be defended by your protecting help. Therefore, Lord,\n(1152.8, 1157.28)  we pray graciously accept this oblation of our service, that of your whole family,\n(1157.28, 1161.12)  order our days in your peace, and command that we be delivered from eternal\n(1161.12, 1166.44)  damnation and counted among the flock of those who have chosen. Be pleased, O God,\n(1166.44, 1170.96)  we pray, to bless, acknowledge, and approve this offering in every respect.\n(1170.96, 1175.72)  make it spiritual and acceptable so that it may become for us the body and blood\n(1175.72, 1181.28)  of your most beloved Son our Lord Jesus Christ. On the day before he was to\n(1181.28, 1186.86)  suffer he took bread in his holy and venerable hands and with eyes raised to\n(1186.86, 1191.8)  heaven to you O God his Almighty Father giving you thanks he said the blessing\n(1191.8, 1198.84)  broke the bread and gave it to his disciples saying take this all of you\n(1198.84, 1207.84)  and eat of it, for this is my body, which will be given up for you.\"\n(1219.84, 1225.56)  In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took this precious chalice in his holy\n(1225.56, 1230.7)  and venerable hands and once more giving you thanks he said the blessing and gave\n(1230.7, 1237.94)  the chalice to his disciples saying take this all of you and drink from it for\n(1237.94, 1243.14)  this is the chalice of my blood the blood of the new and eternal covenant\n(1243.14, 1248.62)  which will be poured out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins do this\n(1248.62, 1252.46)  in memory of me\n(1255.56, 1272.5)  The mystery of faith. Save us, savior of the world, for by your cross and resurrection\n(1272.5, 1277.88)  you have set us free. Therefore, O Lord, as we celebrate the memorial of the blessed passion,\n(1277.88, 1281.6)  the resurrection from the dead and the glorious ascension into heaven of Christ your Son our\n(1281.6, 1286.1)  Lord. We your servants and your holy people offer to your glorious majesty\n(1286.1, 1290.26)  from the gifts that you have given us, this pure victim, this holy victim, this\n(1290.26, 1293.82)  spotless victim, the holy bread of eternal life, and the chalice of\n(1293.82, 1298.1)  everlasting salvation. Be pleased to look upon these offerings with the serene and\n(1298.1, 1302.48)  kindly countenance, and to accept them as once you were pleased to accept the\n(1302.48, 1307.28)  gifts of your servant Abel the Just, the sacrifice of Abraham our father in faith,\n(1307.28, 1312.24)  and the offering of your high priest, Melchizedek, a holy sacrifice, a spotless\n(1312.24, 1316.92)  victim, and humble prayer we ask you, Almighty God, command that these gifts be\n(1316.92, 1321.04)  borne by the hands of your holy angel to your altar on high, in the sight of your\n(1321.04, 1325.28)  divine majesty, so that all of us who through this participation at the altar\n(1325.28, 1329.88)  receive the most holy body and blood of your Son may be filled with every grace\n(1329.88, 1336.08)  and heavenly blessing. Remember also, Lord, your servants who have gone before us\n(1336.08, 1343.9)  with a sign of faith and rest in the sleep of peace grant them oh Lord we\n(1343.9, 1348.32)  pray and all who sleep in Christ a place of refreshment light and peace to us\n(1348.32, 1353.02)  also your servants through those sinners hope in your abundant mercies graciously\n(1353.02, 1356.54)  grants them share in fellowship with your holy apostles and martyrs with John\n(1356.54, 1362.12)  the Baptist Stephen Matthias Barnabas Ignatius Alexander Marcellinus Peter\n(1362.12, 1367.72)  Felicity Perpetua, Agatha, Lucy, Agnes, Cecilia, Anastasia, and all your Saints.\n(1367.72, 1371.72)  Admit us we beseech you into their company, not weighing our merits, but\n(1371.72, 1375.56)  granting us your pardon. Through Christ our Lord, through whom you continue to\n(1375.56, 1380.06)  make all these good things, O Lord, you sanctify them, fill them with life, bless\n(1380.06, 1388.8)  them, and bestow them upon us. Through him, and with him, and in him, O God Almighty\n(1388.8, 1397.88)  Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, all glory and honour is yours, forever and ever.\n(1397.88, 1403.2)  At the Saviour's command, informed by divine teaching, we dare to say,\n(1403.2, 1407.48)  Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.\n(1407.48, 1412.3)  Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.\n(1412.3, 1418.62)  Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who\n(1418.62, 1422.9)  who trespass against us and lead us not into temptation,\n(1422.9, 1425.1)  but deliver us from evil.\n(1425.1, 1427.46)  Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil.\n(1427.46, 1429.62)  Graciously grant peace in our days,\n(1429.62, 1431.02)  that by the help of your mercy,\n(1431.02, 1434.82)  we may be always free from sin and safe from all distress\n(1434.82, 1436.12)  as we await the blessed hope\n(1436.12, 1438.86)  and the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ.\n(1442.96, 1445.34)  Lord Jesus Christ, who said to your apostles,\n(1445.34, 1447.48)  peace I leave you, my peace I give you.\n(1447.48, 1450.2)  Look not on our sins, but on the faith of your church,\n(1450.2, 1452.2)  and graciously grant her peace and unity\n(1452.2, 1453.6)  in accordance with your will,\n(1453.6, 1456.02)  who live and reign forever and ever.\n(1456.02, 1458.16)  The peace of the Lord be with you always.\n(1459.04, 1461.48)  Let us offer each other the sign of peace.\n(1464.88, 1468.36)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world,\n(1468.36, 1470.2)  have mercy on us.\n(1470.2, 1473.6)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world,\n(1473.6, 1475.4)  have mercy on us.\n(1475.4, 1481.26)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world. Grant us peace.\n(1494.38, 1499.86)  Behold the Lamb of God. Behold him who takes away the sins of the world.\n(1499.86, 1504.98)  Blessed are those called to the Supper of the Lamb. Lord, I am not worthy that\n(1504.98, 1511.3)  that you should enter under my roof, but only say the word and my soul shall be healed.\n(1534.98, 1561.02)  They drank the chalice of the Lord and became the friends of God.\n(1561.02, 1568.02)  So, thank you very much for your attention.\n(1798.02, 1803.02)  Let us pray.\n(1803.02, 1808.02)  Help us, O Lord, we pray, through the intercession of the Blessed Apostle James,\n(1808.02, 1814.02)  on whose feast day we have received with joy your holy gifts, through Christ our Lord.\n(1814.02, 1816.02)  The Lord be with you.\n(1816.02, 1821.02)  May almighty God bless you, the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit.\n(1821.02, 1825.02)  Go forth, the Mass has ended.\n(1825.02, 1830.62)  Saint Michael the Archangel defend us in battle and be our protection against the\n(1830.62, 1836.22)  wickedness and snares of the devil. May God rebuke him we humbly pray and do\n(1836.22, 1841.7)  thou the prince of the heavenly hosts by the power of God cast into hell Satan\n(1841.7, 1849.7)  and all the evil spirits who prowl about the world seeking the ruin of souls. Amen.\n(1944.02, 1946.02)  Thank you so much for joining us, and we'll see you next time.\n",

        "transcript": "(0.0, 7.0)  So, thank you very much for joining us today, and we'll see you in the next session.\n(120.0, 122.0)  .\n(150.0, 152.0)  .\n(210.0, 212.0)  .\n(240.0, 259.0)  As he walked by the Sea of Galilee, Jesus saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, mending their nets, and he called them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.\n(259.0, 261.0)  The Lord be with you.\n(261.0, 267.0)  Today's mass is offered for a special intention, and we celebrate the feast of St. James the Apostle.\n(267.0, 268.92)  And in addition to this special intention,\n(268.92, 271.36)  if you could please keep the repose of the soul\n(271.36, 273.2)  of Caroline Martin in your prayers.\n(273.2, 275.02)  Caroline is a very young woman\n(275.02, 277.08)  who tragically died in her sleep.\n(277.08, 279.52)  And I have to race out to the funeral mass\n(279.52, 280.68)  to offer that mass for her,\n(280.68, 282.66)  so we will forgo the homily today.\n(283.84, 286.4)  My brothers and sisters, let us acknowledge our sins\n(286.4, 289.94)  and so prepare ourselves to celebrate the sacred mysteries.\n(292.04, 296.5)  I confess to almighty God and to you my brothers and sisters\n(296.5, 298.4)  that I have greatly sinned.\n(298.4, 301.7)  In my thoughts and in my words and what I have done\n(301.7, 303.58)  and what I have failed to do,\n(303.58, 305.66)  through my fault, through my fault,\n(305.66, 307.7)  through my most grievous fault,\n(307.7, 310.58)  therefore I ask the blessed Mary ever virgin,\n(310.58, 314.58)  all the angels and saints and you my brothers and sisters\n(314.58, 317.04)  to pray for me to the Lord our God.\n(317.04, 318.98)  May almighty God have mercy on us,\n(318.98, 321.9)  forgive us our sins and bring us to everlasting life.\n(322.74, 324.0)  Lord have mercy.\n(325.14, 324.0) \n(333.18, 339.48)  Christ have mercy, Lord have mercy, glory to God in the highest and on earth peace to people of goodwill. We praise you, we bless you, we adore you, we glorify you, we\n(339.48, 344.72)  give you thanks for your great glory. Lord God, heavenly King, O God almighty\n(344.72, 351.8)  Father, Lord Jesus Christ, only begotten Son, Lord God, Lamb of God, Son of the\n(351.8, 358.52)  Father, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us. You take away the sins of the world,\n(358.52, 364.52)  receive our prayer. You are seated at the right hand of the Father, have mercy on us. For you\n(364.52, 370.84)  alone are the Holy One, you alone are the Lord, you alone are the Most High, Jesus Christ, with\n(370.84, 376.04)  the Holy Spirit, in the glory of God the Father. Amen. Let us pray.\n(378.6, 376.04) \n(383.28, 388.32)  O mighty ever-living God, who consecrated the firstfruits of your apostles by the blood of St. James, grant, we pray, that your church may be strengthened by his\n(388.32, 393.08)  confession of faith and constantly sustained by his protection. Through our\n(393.08, 397.24)  Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the\n(397.24, 401.68)  Holy Spirit, God forever and ever.\n(406.04, 420.04)  A reading from the Second Letter of St. Paul to the Corinthians.\n(420.04, 428.1)  Brothers and sisters, we hold this treasure in earthen vessels, that the surpassing power\n(428.1, 432.5)  may be of God and not from us.\n(432.5, 445.44)  We are afflicted in every way but not constrained, perplexed but not driven to despair, persecuted\n(445.44, 456.12)  but not abandoned, struck down but not destroyed, always carrying about in the body the dying\n(456.12, 465.08)  of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our body.\n(465.08, 472.24)  For we who live are constantly being given up to death for the sake of Jesus, so that\n(472.24, 479.78)  the life of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal souls.\n(479.78, 485.66)  So death is at work in us, but life in you.\n(485.66, 495.5)  Since then we have the same spirit of faith according to what is written, I believed,\n(495.5, 498.42)  therefore I spoke.\n(498.42, 506.18)  We too believe and therefore speak, knowing that the one who raised the Lord Jesus will\n(506.18, 514.5)  raise us also with Jesus and place us with you in his presence.\n(514.5, 524.36)  Nothing indeed is for you, so that the grace bestowed in abundance on more and more people\n(524.36, 531.58)  may cause the thanksgiving to overflow for the glory of God.\n(531.58, 537.36)  The Word of the Lord.\n(537.36, 542.48)  Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.\n(542.48, 546.24)  Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.\n(546.24, 552.76)  When the Lord brought back the captives of Zion, we were like men dreaming.\n(552.76, 559.3)  Then our mouth was filled with laughter and our tongue with rejoicing.\n(559.3, 563.76)  Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.\n(563.76, 570.96)  Then they said among the nations, The Lord has done great things for them.\n(570.96, 573.92)  The Lord has done great things for us.\n(573.92, 576.72)  We are glad indeed.\n(576.72, 580.4)  Those who sow in tears shall be rejoicing.\n(580.4, 587.36)  Restore our fortunes, O Lord, like the torrents in the southern desert.\n(587.36, 592.52)  Those that sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.\n(592.52, 596.28)  Those who sow in tears shall reap rejoicing.\n(596.28, 602.28)  Although they go forth weeping, carrying the seed to be sown,\n(602.28, 607.28)  they shall come back rejoicing, carrying their sheaves.\n(607.28, 611.28)  Those who sow in tears shall weep rejoicing.\n(625.28, 611.28) \n(627.52, 633.32)  The Lord be with you. A reading from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew.\n(633.32, 637.96)  The mother of the sons of Zebedee approached Jesus with her sons and did him homage, wishing\n(637.96, 639.72)  to ask him for something.\n(639.72, 642.12)  He said to her, what do you wish?\n(642.12, 645.68)  She answered him, command that these two sons of mine sit,\n(645.68, 647.48)  one at your right and the other at your left\n(647.48, 648.8)  in your kingdom.\n(648.8, 652.52)  Jesus said in reply, you do not know what you are asking.\n(652.52, 655.44)  Can you drink the chalice that I'm going to drink?\n(655.44, 657.72)  They said to him, we can.\n(657.72, 660.96)  He replied, my chalice you will indeed drink,\n(660.96, 662.84)  but to sit at my right and at my left,\n(662.84, 664.72)  this is not mine to give,\n(664.72, 667.0)  but it is for those for whom it has been prepared\n(667.0, 668.64)  by my Father.\n(668.64, 670.72)  When the 10 heard this, they became indignant\n(670.72, 674.44)  at the two brothers, but Jesus summoned them and said,\n(674.44, 677.4)  you know that the rulers of the Gentiles lorded over them,\n(677.4, 680.52)  and the great ones make their authority over them felt,\n(680.52, 682.62)  but it shall not be so among you.\n(682.62, 685.92)  Rather, whoever wishes to be great among you\n(685.92, 687.42)  shall be your servant.\n(687.42, 690.72)  Whoever wishes to be first among you shall be your slave.\n(690.72, 694.08)  Just so, the son of man did not come to be served,\n(694.08, 697.76)  but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many.\n(697.76, 699.18)  the gospel of the Lord.\n(701.68, 705.2)  And you can remain standing for the prayers of the faithful.\n(705.2, 708.66)  We pray for Pope Leo and for Bishop Richard Henning\n(708.66, 710.94)  and for all bishops throughout the church.\n(710.94, 713.78)  May God give them the grace to be true shepherds of souls\n(713.78, 716.36)  after the heart of St. James, we pray to the Lord.\n(717.82, 719.76)  We pray for all civil leaders, governments,\n(719.76, 721.62)  and elected officials throughout the world.\n(721.62, 724.32)  May they enact policies that protect the church\n(724.32, 726.02)  and give her the freedom to be herself\n(726.02, 727.78)  so the kingdom of heaven can be,\n(727.78, 729.2)  the kingdom of God can be spread\n(729.2, 730.46)  to every corner of the globe.\n(730.46, 731.58)  We pray to the Lord.\n(733.18, 735.74)  We pray for an increase of vocations to the priesthood\n(735.74, 736.94)  and to the religious life,\n(736.94, 739.18)  especially for members from our own parishes\n(739.18, 740.18)  and our own families.\n(740.18, 741.32)  We pray to the Lord.\n(742.72, 744.42)  We pray for the special intention\n(744.42, 746.24)  for which this mass is offered.\n(746.24, 747.36)  We pray to the Lord.\n(748.8, 751.7)  And we pray for the repose of the soul of Caroline Martin\n(751.7, 754.1)  and for the consolation and comfort of her family\n(754.1, 755.3)  during this difficult time.\n(755.3, 756.44)  we pray to the Lord.\n(758.22, 761.18)  Heavenly Father, we make these prayers with great confidence\n(761.18, 763.74)  as we ask them through the intercession of St. James\n(763.74, 766.06)  and Mary, our morning star and gate of heaven,\n(766.06, 768.3)  and we speak them in the name of Jesus, her son,\n(768.3, 770.04)  who is Lord forever and ever.\n(845.3, 856.84)  Pray, brothers and sisters, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God, the Almighty\n(856.84, 866.72)  Father.\n(866.72, 871.48)  Cleanse us, Lord, by the saving baptism of your Son's passion, so that on the feast day\n(871.48, 876.16)  of Saint James whom you will to be the first among the apostles to drink of\n(876.16, 881.2)  Christ's chalice of suffering we may offer a sacrifice pleasing to you through\n(881.2, 889.6)  Christ our Lord the Lord be with you lift up your hearts let us give thanks\n(889.6, 895.36)  to the Lord our God it is truly right and just our duty and our salvation\n(895.36, 900.04)  always and everywhere to give you thanks Lord Holy Father Almighty eternal God\n(900.04, 905.52)  For you, eternal shepherd, do not desert your flock, but through the blessed apostles, watch\n(905.52, 909.96)  over it and protect it always, so that it may be governed by those who have appointed\n(909.96, 913.1)  shepherds, to lead it in the name of your Son.\n(913.1, 917.8)  And so with angels and archangels, with thrones and dominions, and with all the hosts and\n(917.8, 923.36)  powers of heaven, we sing the hymn of your glory, as without end we acclaim.\n(923.36, 929.36)  Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts, heaven and earth are full of your glory.\n(929.36, 931.86)  Hosanna in the highest.\n(931.86, 934.78)  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.\n(934.78, 936.56)  Hosanna in the highest.\n(938.06, 940.28)  You are indeed holy, O Lord,\n(940.28, 943.1)  and all you have created rightly gives you praise.\n(943.1, 945.76)  For through your son, our Lord Jesus Christ,\n(945.76, 948.18)  by the power and working of the Holy Spirit,\n(948.18, 950.78)  you give life to all things and make them holy,\n(950.78, 953.6)  and you never cease to gather a people to yourself,\n(953.6, 956.42)  so that from the rising of the sun to its setting,\n(956.42, 959.74)  a pure sacrifice may be offered to your name.\n(959.74, 962.38)  Therefore, O Lord, we humbly implore you,\n(962.38, 965.22)  by the same Spirit graciously make holy these gifts\n(965.22, 967.34)  we have brought to you for consecration,\n(967.34, 970.14)  that they may become the body and blood\n(970.14, 972.9)  of your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ,\n(972.9, 975.82)  at whose command we celebrate these mysteries.\n(975.82, 978.38)  For on the night he was betrayed,\n(978.38, 981.3)  he himself took breath, and giving you thanks,\n(981.3, 983.9)  he said the blessing, broke the breath,\n(983.9, 986.36)  and gave it to his disciples, saying,\n(987.34, 991.7)  take this, all of you, and eat of it,\n(991.7, 996.7)  for this is my body, which will be given up for you.\n(999.5, 1004.5)  In a similar way, when supper was ended,\n(1013.22, 1004.5) \n(1015.9, 1021.26)  In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took the chalice, and giving you thanks, he said the blessing, and gave the chalice to his disciples, saying,\n(1021.26, 1028.68)  Take this, all of you, and drink from it, for this is the chalice of my blood, the blood\n(1028.68, 1033.38)  of the new and eternal covenant, which will be poured out for you and for many for the\n(1033.38, 1039.54)  forgiveness of sins. Do this in memory of me.\n(1050.98, 1057.26)  The mystery of faith. Save us, Savior of the world, for by your cross and\n(1057.26, 1062.42)  resurrection you have set us free. Therefore, O Lord, as we celebrate the\n(1062.42, 1067.14)  memorial of the saving passion of your son, his wondrous resurrection and ascension into\n(1067.14, 1071.46)  heaven, and as we look forward to his second coming, we offer you in thanksgiving this\n(1071.46, 1076.7)  holy and living sacrifice. Look, we pray, upon the oblation of your church and recognizing\n(1076.7, 1081.7)  the sacrificial victim by whose death you willed to reconcile us to yourself. Granted,\n(1081.7, 1086.02)  we who are nourished by the body and blood of your son and filled with his Holy Spirit\n(1086.02, 1091.5)  may become one body, one spirit in Christ. May he make of us an eternal offering to you\n(1091.5, 1094.26)  so that we may obtain an inheritance with your elect,\n(1094.26, 1096.38)  especially with the most blessed Virgin Mary,\n(1096.38, 1099.54)  Mother of God, with blessed Joseph, her spouse,\n(1099.54, 1101.9)  with your blessed apostles and glorious martyrs,\n(1101.9, 1104.66)  with Saint James, and with all the saints.\n(1104.66, 1107.1)  Under his constant intercession in your presence,\n(1107.1, 1109.2)  we rely for unfailing help.\n(1109.2, 1112.86)  May this sacrifice of our reconciliation, we pray, O Lord,\n(1112.86, 1115.74)  advance the peace and salvation of all the world.\n(1115.74, 1117.82)  Be pleased to confirm in faith and charity\n(1117.82, 1119.36)  our pilgrim church on earth,\n(1119.36, 1123.0)  with your servant, Leo, our pope, and Richard, our bishop,\n(1123.0, 1124.98)  the order of bishops, all the clergy,\n(1124.98, 1127.74)  and the entire people you have gained for your own.\n(1127.74, 1130.9)  Listen graciously to the prayers of this family,\n(1130.9, 1132.76)  whom you have summoned before you,\n(1132.76, 1135.04)  in your compassion and merciful father,\n(1135.04, 1136.78)  gather to yourself all your children\n(1136.78, 1138.52)  scattered throughout the world.\n(1138.52, 1140.78)  To our departed brothers and sisters,\n(1140.78, 1142.08)  and to all who are pleasing to you\n(1142.08, 1144.04)  at their passing from this life,\n(1144.04, 1145.96)  give kind admittance to your kingdom,\n(1145.96, 1148.88)  there we hope to enjoy forever the fullness of your glory,\n(1148.88, 1150.28)  through Christ our Lord,\n(1150.28, 1153.08)  through whom you bestow on the world all that is good.\n(1157.96, 1160.08)  Through him and with him and in him,\n(1160.08, 1164.08)  O God, almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\n(1164.08, 1167.46)  all glory and honor is yours forever and ever.\n(1169.64, 1173.32)  At the Savior's command, informed by divine teaching,\n(1173.32, 1177.44)  we dare to say, our Father, who art in heaven,\n(1177.44, 1181.78)  hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done,\n(1181.78, 1183.84)  on earth as it is in heaven.\n(1183.84, 1186.38)  Give us this day our daily bread,\n(1186.38, 1188.8)  and forgive us our trespasses,\n(1188.8, 1192.14)  as we forgive those who trespass against us,\n(1192.14, 1194.46)  and lead us not into temptation,\n(1194.46, 1196.5)  but deliver us from evil.\n(1196.5, 1198.86)  Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil.\n(1198.86, 1201.02)  Graciously grant peace in our days,\n(1201.02, 1202.42)  that by the help of your mercy\n(1202.42, 1204.38)  we may be always free from sin,\n(1204.38, 1206.14)  and safe from all distress,\n(1206.14, 1209.06)  as we await the blessed hope and the coming of our Savior,\n(1209.06, 1210.18)  Jesus Christ.\n(1214.66, 1217.22)  Lord Jesus Christ, you said to your apostles,\n(1217.22, 1219.22)  peace I leave you, my peace I give you.\n(1219.22, 1222.02)  Look not in our sins, but on the faith of your church,\n(1222.02, 1224.1)  and graciously grant her peace and unity\n(1224.1, 1225.58)  in accordance with your will,\n(1225.58, 1228.14)  who live and reign forever and ever.\n(1228.14, 1230.38)  The peace of the Lord be with you always.\n(1231.34, 1233.5)  Let us offer each other this sign of peace.\n(1236.14, 1242.14)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1242.14, 1247.14)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1247.14, 1252.14)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, grant us peace.\n(1266.14, 1271.62)  Behold the Lamb of God. Behold him who takes away the sins of the world.\n(1271.62, 1276.62)  Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb. Lord, I am not worthy that\n(1276.62, 1283.82)  you should enter under my roof, but only say the word and my soul shall be healed.\n(1296.14, 1325.14)  They drank the chalice of the Lord and became the friends of God.\n(1505.14, 1507.14)  .\n(1565.14, 1573.54)  Let us pray.\n(1573.54, 1573.74)  Help us.\n",

        "transcript": "(30.0, 37.0)  So, thank you very much for joining us today, and we'll see you in the next session.\n(270.0, 276.44)  Good morning, everyone.\n(276.44, 281.8)  In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, the grace of our Lord\n(281.8, 286.64)  Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with all of\n(286.64, 288.64)  you.\n(288.64, 294.82)  Today we celebrate the feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel as we honor the Blessed Virgin\n(294.82, 295.82)  Mary today.\n(295.82, 299.94)  take a moment as we ask the Lord's forgiveness for our sins.\n(302.74, 307.54)  I confess to almighty God and to you my brothers and sisters\n(307.54, 311.9)  that I have greatly sinned in my thoughts and in my words\n(311.9, 315.42)  and what I have done and what I have failed to do.\n(315.42, 317.7)  Through my fault, through my fault,\n(317.7, 320.2)  through my most grievous fault,\n(320.2, 323.36)  therefore I ask blessed Mary ever virgin,\n(323.36, 325.42)  all the angels and saints,\n(325.42, 327.34)  and you, my brothers and sisters,\n(327.34, 330.42)  to pray for me to the Lord our God.\n(330.42, 333.9)  May almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us our sins,\n(333.9, 337.2)  and bring us to everlasting life.\n(337.2, 338.16)  Let us pray.\n(340.8, 344.58)  May the venerable intercession of the glorious Virgin Mary\n(344.58, 347.56)  come to our aid, we pray, O Lord,\n(347.56, 350.46)  so that fortified by her protection,\n(350.46, 353.74)  we may reach the mountain which is Christ,\n(353.74, 360.22)  lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit God forever and ever.\n(372.26, 377.62)  Reading from the book of Exodus, Moses was tending the flock of his father and\n(377.62, 383.08)  Lord Jethro, the priest of Midian. Leading the flock across the desert, he came to\n(383.08, 388.12)  Horeb, the mountain of God. There an angel of the Lord appeared to him in\n(388.12, 393.52)  fire flaming out of a bush. As he looked on he was surprised to see that the bush,\n(393.52, 399.4)  the one fire, was not consumed. So Moses decided I must go over to look at this\n(399.4, 405.36)  remarkable sight and see why the bush is not burned. When the Lord saw him coming\n(405.36, 409.8)  over to take a look at it more closely, God called out to him from the bush,\n(409.8, 418.18)  Moses Moses he answered here I am God said come no nearer remove the sandals\n(418.18, 423.18)  from your feet for the place where you stand is holy ground I am the God of\n(423.18, 428.58)  your father he continued the God of Abraham the God of Isaac the God of\n(428.58, 433.86)  Jacob the cry of the children of Israel has reached me and I have truly noted\n(433.86, 439.22)  that the Egyptians are oppressing them come now I will send you to Pharaoh to\n(439.22, 443.78)  lead my people, the children of Israel out of Egypt.\n(443.78, 446.98)  But Moses said to God, who am I that I should go to Pharaoh\n(446.98, 450.1)  and lead the children of Israel out of Egypt?\n(450.1, 453.5)  He answered, I will be with you, and this shall be approved\n(453.5, 456.22)  that it is I who have sent you.\n(456.22, 458.3)  When you bring my people out of Egypt,\n(458.3, 461.32)  you will worship God on this very mountain.\n(461.32, 462.52)  The word of the Lord.\n(464.28, 466.38)  Responsorial Psalm.\n(466.38, 468.84)  The Lord is kind and merciful.\n(469.22, 477.22)  the Lord. Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all my being bless his holy name. Bless the Lord,\n(477.22, 486.06)  O my soul, and forget not all his benefits. He pardons all your iniquities. He heals\n(486.06, 496.26)  all your ills. He redeems your life from destruction. He crowns you with kindness and compassion.\n(496.26, 500.54)  The Lord secures justice, and the rights of all the oppressed.\n(500.54, 505.3)  He has made known his ways to Moses and his deeds to the children of Israel.\n(526.26, 538.5)  the Lord be with you a reading from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew at that\n(538.5, 545.5)  time Jesus exclaimed I gave praise to you father Lord of heaven and earth for\n(545.5, 549.42)  although you have hidden these things from the wise and the learned you have\n(549.42, 555.18)  revealed them to the childlike yes father such has been your gracious will\n(555.18, 561.92)  All things have been handed over to me by my Father. No one knows the Son except\n(561.92, 566.98)  the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son, and anyone to whom the\n(566.98, 573.08)  Son wishes to reveal him.\" The Gospel of the Lord.\n(577.6, 583.48)  In today's Gospel, Jesus praises the Father for revealing the mysteries of\n(583.48, 590.12)  of the kingdom, not to the wise and the learned, but to the childlike.\n(590.12, 596.62)  And on this feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel we see in Mary the perfect example of that\n(596.62, 599.56)  childlike heart.\n(599.56, 607.22)  Mary did not seek status or acclaim, she simply received God's word with humility and trusted\n(607.22, 609.34)  in that word.\n(609.34, 615.26)  Her greatness lies not in what she accomplished by human standards, but in how deeply she\n(615.26, 617.16)  trusted the Lord.\n(617.16, 625.2)  She teaches us that the way to know God is not through pride or power, but through surrender.\n(625.2, 633.24)  Mount Carmel, with its roots in the prophet Elijah and the contemplative life of the Carmelites,\n(633.24, 641.12)  reminds us that God is found not in the noise of the world, but in silence and in stillness,\n(641.12, 645.36)  in a heart that listens to the Lord.\n(645.36, 651.36)  Mary shows us how to live this way, of course, also, not by doing great things, but by being\n(651.36, 656.6)  open to the great things God can do through us.\n(656.6, 661.68)  Jesus says in that Gospel that no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom\n(661.68, 669.52)  the Son reveals him.\" Mary received that revelation deeply and now she helps us\n(669.52, 677.72)  to receive it also. Mary always points us to Christ and helps us to live as\n(677.72, 684.84)  children of the Father. So today let us ask for that same childlike spirit,\n(684.84, 690.6)  humble, trusting, and open, and let us follow Mary in the quiet path of faith\n(690.6, 699.8)  that leads us to Jesus. So Our Lady of Mount Carmel pray for us today. Let us\n(699.8, 709.28)  pray. We lift up our prayers to God, trusting in his love and his mercy. We\n(709.28, 714.76)  pray for the church. May God raise up holy men and women to labor on\n(714.76, 723.16)  his behalf, we pray to the Lord. For elected officials, may God's Spirit guide\n(723.16, 731.28)  them in formulating public policy, we pray to the Lord. For the homebound, may\n(731.28, 737.0)  Jesus the divine physician be present in their caregivers and community, we pray\n(737.0, 744.34)  to the Lord. For our faith community, may the Holy Spirit instill childlike faith\n(744.34, 751.84)  in each of us we pray to the Lord for all the sick that God's healing presence\n(751.84, 759.96)  may be with them we pray to the Lord for the faithful departed our parishioners\n(759.96, 765.28)  family and friends who have gone before us may the Lord welcome them into the\n(765.28, 772.4)  fullness of his kingdom we pray to the Lord father please hear and answer our\n(772.4, 777.88)  prayers today which we offer through Christ our Lord.\n(802.4, 813.48)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through your goodness we have received\n(813.48, 817.76)  the bread we offer you, fruit of the earth and work of human hands.\n(817.76, 821.04)  It will become for us the bread of life.\n(821.04, 827.88)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through your goodness we have received\n(827.88, 832.08)  the wine we offer you, fruit of the vine and work of human hands.\n(832.08, 849.44)  It will become our spiritual drink.\n(849.44, 855.32)  Pray brothers and sisters that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God the almighty\n(855.32, 868.16)  Father, receive, O Lord, we ask the prayers of your people with the\n(868.16, 873.4)  sacrificial offerings that through the intercession of Blessed Mary, the mother\n(873.4, 879.48)  of your son, no petition may go unanswered, no request be made in\n(879.48, 889.6)  vain through Christ our Lord. The Lord be with you. Lift up your hearts. Let us\n(889.6, 896.16)  give thanks to the Lord our God. It is truly right and just our duty and our\n(896.16, 902.24)  salvation to praise your mighty deeds in the exaltation of all the saints and\n(902.24, 908.16)  especially as we celebrate the memory of the Blessed Virgin Mary to proclaim your\n(908.16, 914.94)  kindness as we echo her thankful hymn of praise. For truly even to earth's ends\n(914.94, 921.52)  you have done great things and extended your abundant mercy from age to age. When\n(921.52, 926.38)  you looked on the lowliness of your handmaid, you gave us through her the\n(926.38, 933.26)  author of our salvation, your son Jesus Christ our Lord. Through him the host of\n(933.26, 938.78)  angels adores your majesty may our voices we pray join with theirs in one\n(938.78, 948.0)  chorus of exultant praise as we acclaim holy holy holy Lord God of hosts heaven\n(948.0, 953.96)  and earth are full of your glory hosanna in the highest blessed is he who comes\n(953.96, 961.9)  in the name of the Lord hosanna in the highest you are indeed holy o Lord\n(961.9, 967.74)  the fount of all holiness make holy therefore these gifts we pray by sending\n(967.74, 972.46)  down your spirit upon them like the dewfall so that they may become for us\n(972.46, 979.06)  the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ at the time he was betrayed and\n(979.06, 984.38)  entered willingly into his passion he took bread and giving thanks broke it\n(984.38, 990.82)  and gave it to his disciples saying take this all of you and eat of it for this\n(990.82, 1003.96)  This is my body, which will be given up for you.\n(1003.96, 1008.82)  In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took the chalice, and once more giving thanks,\n(1008.82, 1014.44)  he gave it to his disciples, saying, Take this, all of you, and drink from it.\n(1014.44, 1019.56)  For this is the chalice of my blood, the blood of the new and eternal covenant, which will\n(1019.56, 1024.68)  be poured out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Do this in\n(1024.68, 1028.04)  memory of me.\n(1034.88, 1041.6)  The mystery of faith. We proclaim your death, O Lord, and profess your\n(1041.6, 1047.48)  resurrection until you come again. Therefore, as we celebrate the memorial\n(1047.48, 1051.64)  of his death and resurrection we offer you Lord the bread of life and the\n(1051.64, 1057.08)  chalice of salvation giving thanks that you have held us worthy to be in your\n(1057.08, 1062.92)  presence and minister to you humbly we pray that partaking of the body and\n(1062.92, 1069.16)  blood of Christ we may be gathered into one by the Holy Spirit remember Lord\n(1069.16, 1074.2)  your church spread throughout the world and bring her to the fullness of charity\n(1074.2, 1081.1)  together with Leo our Pope and Richard our Bishop and all the clergy. Remember\n(1081.1, 1085.54)  also our brothers and sisters who have fallen asleep in the hope of the\n(1085.54, 1091.22)  resurrection and all who have died in your mercy. Welcome them into the light\n(1091.22, 1097.18)  of your face and have mercy on us all we pray that with the Blessed Virgin Mary\n(1097.18, 1103.78)  Mother of God, Saint Joseph her spouse, with the Blessed Apostles and all the\n(1103.78, 1108.62)  saints who have pleased you throughout the ages that we may merit to be co-heirs\n(1108.62, 1114.14)  to eternal life and may praise and glorify you through your son Jesus\n(1114.14, 1120.94)  Christ. Through him and with him and in him O God Almighty Father in the unity\n(1120.94, 1129.62)  of the Holy Spirit all glory and honor is yours forever and ever. At the\n(1129.62, 1136.82)  Savior's command and formed by divine teaching we dare to pray now. Our Father who art in heaven,\n(1136.82, 1144.58)  hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this\n(1144.58, 1152.82)  day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us and\n(1152.82, 1157.82)  and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.\n(1157.82, 1160.62)  Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil.\n(1160.62, 1162.9)  Graciously grant peace in our days,\n(1162.9, 1165.06)  that by the help of your mercy,\n(1165.06, 1169.2)  we may be always free from sin and safe from all distress,\n(1169.2, 1170.82)  as we await the blessed hope\n(1170.82, 1174.02)  in the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ.\n(1174.02, 1178.14)  In the kingdom, the power, and the glory be with you.\n(1178.14, 1180.62)  Lord Jesus Christ, who said to your apostles,\n(1180.62, 1185.1)  peace I leave you, my peace I give you. Look not now on our sins but on the\n(1185.1, 1189.82)  faith of your church and graciously grant her peace and unity in accordance\n(1189.82, 1194.14)  with your will, who live and reign forever and ever.\n(1194.14, 1199.82)  The peace of the Lord be with you always.

Maybe you never have even heard\n(720.04, 727.04)  of them, for they live a life hidden away in service to God, and they've been there\n(727.36, 734.36)  and their predecessors for over 100 years. Devotion to Our Blessed Lady, for all of us,\n(739.2, 734.36) \n(743.0, 753.92)  Devotion to Our Blessed Lady, for all of us, comes in several different ways. We all pray to Mary and through Mary to God for whatever it is that we need.\n(753.92, 762.32)  What we need to remember is in the psalm response today, the Almighty has done great things\n(762.32, 769.32)  for me, and holy is His name. It was the Almighty God Himself who chose Mary to be His mother,\n(775.48, 782.48)  and therefore the mother of us all, because when He died on the cross at Calvary, one\n(782.58, 789.58)  of the things that He said from the cross was giving, the words that give, the words\n(792.32, 802.12)  us the understanding today and gave to the Apostle St. John, who was so close to Jesus,\n(802.12, 812.54)  the announcement at that point that Mary was our mother and the mother of us all.\n(812.54, 822.3)  At the moment of his death, Jesus shared that particular instance in reminding us that Mary\n(822.3, 830.5)  Mary, as she is his mother, so she is our mother too.\n(830.5, 839.98)  And when we pray as we do today, the words of the psalm response, I think, honor Mary\n(839.98, 847.26)  and encourage us as well, knowing that the Almighty has done great things for us and\n(847.26, 849.74)  holy is His name.\n(849.74, 855.74)  could have been greater for us than the gift that he gives to us of Mary, our mother.\n(858.62, 863.98)  Today we renew once again on this particular feast, and there are a number of them in the\n(863.98, 872.3)  course of the year, our love for Mary, the mother of God, and our mother, return to her for all that\n(872.3, 882.66)  needs, quietly within our own hearts, confident and certain that she will be the intercessor\n(882.66, 886.62)  for us with her son Jesus.\n(886.62, 892.02)  How blessed indeed we are.\n(892.02, 898.02)  We pray today for our deceased loved ones, for our benefactors, our relatives and friends,\n(898.02, 911.74)  And particularly, ironically, for Siobhan Laue, I celebrated the marriage of Siobhan Laue\n(911.74, 919.0)  many years ago, and I knew her family very well in Ireland from when she came.\n(919.0, 926.5)  I'm honored that by accident perhaps I should be celebrating this Mass in memory of her\n(926.5, 930.44)  and in memory of Catherine Hayes.\n(930.44, 934.94)  May they rest in peace, and let us pray to the Lord.\n(937.32, 939.92)  For all those for whom we've been asked to pray,\n(941.08, 944.96)  those known to us and unknown to us,\n(944.96, 948.68)  and those who have no one else to pray for them except us,\n(948.68, 950.6)  let us pray to the Lord.\n(953.4, 950.6) \n(961.6, 967.6)  For all our benefactors, relatives, and friends who depend on us for our prayer, through the intercession of our blessed Lady, let us pray to the Lord.\n(967.6, 972.6)  For the people who are suffering throughout the world from all the effects of poverty,\n(972.6, 978.6)  tragedy, hunger, homelessness, and war.\n(978.6, 988.7)  That God may bring about soon some happy solution for all these people, our brothers and sisters\n(988.7, 994.06)  in Christ, let us pray to the Lord.\n(994.06, 999.66)  For an increase in vocations to the priesthood and religious life, particularly from among\n(999.66, 1008.46)  the families of our own parish, let us pray to the Lord.\n(1008.46, 1011.7)  for our own personal needs and intentions today\n(1011.7, 1014.74)  that we've kept quietly in our hearts.\n(1014.74, 1016.98)  Let us pray to the Lord.\n(1018.78, 1022.46)  Oh God, we ask you to hear these prayers of ours,\n(1022.46, 1024.74)  which we present to you through the intercession\n(1024.74, 1027.58)  of our blessed lady as we pray.\n(1027.58, 1031.7)  Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.\n(1031.7, 1033.94)  Blessed art thou among women,\n(1033.94, 1037.3)  and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.\n(1037.3, 1039.58)  Holy Mary, Mother of God,\n(1039.58, 1043.9)  pray for our sinners now and at the hour of our death.\n(1043.9, 1044.74)  Amen.\n(1067.3, 1091.66)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through your goodness we have received\n(1091.66, 1098.26)  the bread we offer you, fruit of the earth and work of human hands, it will become for\n(1098.26, 1105.26)  us the bread of life. By the mystery of this water and wine may we come to share in the\n(1106.9, 1113.9)  divinity of Christ, who humbled himself to share in our humanity. Blessed are you who\n(1121.66, 1127.66)  Lord God of all creation, for through your goodness we have received the wine we offer you.\n(1127.66, 1134.66)  Fruit of the vine and work of human hands, it will become our spiritual drink.\n(1137.66, 1143.66)  With humble spirit and contrite heart, may we be accepted by you, O Lord,\n(1143.66, 1149.66)  and may our sacrifice in your sight this day be pleasing to you, Lord God.\n(1149.66, 1156.66)  Wash me, O Lord, from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.\n(1179.66, 1189.66)  Pray, brothers and sisters, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God, the Almighty Father.\n(1197.66, 1203.66)  Receive, O Lord, we ask the prayers of your people with the sacrificial offerings,\n(1203.66, 1207.66)  that through the intercession of Blessed Mary, the mother of your Son,\n(1207.66, 1213.66)  No petition may go unanswered. No request be made in vain.\n(1213.66, 1217.66)  Through Christ our Lord.\n(1217.66, 1222.66)  The Lord be with you. Lift up your hearts.\n(1222.66, 1227.66)  Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.\n(1227.66, 1231.66)  It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,\n(1231.66, 1236.66)  to praise your mighty deeds in the exaltation of all the saints\n(1236.66, 1243.66)  saints, and especially as we celebrate the memory of the Blessed Virgin Mary, to proclaim\n(1243.66, 1250.66)  your kindness as we echo her thankful hymn of praise. For truly, even to earth's ends,\n(1251.98, 1258.98)  you have done great things and extended your abundant mercy from age to age. When you looked\n(1259.82, 1258.98) \n(1261.98, 1266.98)  When you looked on the loathiness of your handmaid, you gave us through her the offer of our salvation,\n(1266.98, 1270.98)  your Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.\n(1270.98, 1274.98)  Through him the host of angels adores your majesty\n(1274.98, 1278.98)  and rejoices in your presence forever.\n(1278.98, 1285.98)  May our voices, we pray, join with theirs in one chorus of exultant praise\n(1285.98, 1291.98)  as we acclaim Holy, Holy, Holy Lord, God of Hosts.\n(1291.98, 1294.98)  Heaven and earth are full of your glory.\n(1294.98, 1296.98)  Hosanna in the highest.\n(1296.98, 1300.98)  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.\n(1300.98, 1303.98)  Hosanna in the highest.\n(1303.98, 1308.98)  You are indeed holy, O Lord, the fount of all holiness.\n(1308.98, 1311.98)  Make holy, therefore, these gifts, we pray,\n(1311.98, 1316.9)  by sending down your Spirit upon them like the dewfall,\n(1316.9, 1320.88)  so that they may become for us the body and blood\n(1320.88, 1324.2)  of our Lord Jesus Christ.\n(1324.2, 1326.98)  At the time he was betrayed and entered willingly\n(1326.98, 1331.84)  into his passion, he took bread and giving thanks, broke it,\n(1331.84, 1334.2)  and gave it to his disciples saying,\n(1334.2, 1338.6)  take this, all of you, and eat of it.\n(1338.6, 1345.6)  For this is my body, which will be given up for you.\n(1360.6, 1365.6)  In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took the chalice.\n(1365.6, 1369.3)  And once more giving thanks, He gave it to His disciples, saying,\n(1369.3, 1376.7)  Take this, all of you, and drink from it, for this is the chalice of My blood,\n(1376.7, 1383.4)  the blood of the new and eternal covenant which will be poured out for you\n(1383.4, 1387.6)  and for many for the forgiveness of sins.\n(1387.6, 1391.6)  Do this in memory of Me.\n(1395.6, 1415.88)  The mystery of faith, save us, savior of the world, for by your cross and resurrection\n(1415.88, 1418.48)  you have set us free.\n(1418.48, 1423.36)  Therefore as we celebrate the memorial of his death and resurrection, we offer you,\n(1423.36, 1428.64)  Lord, the bread of life and the chalice of salvation, giving thanks that you have held\n(1428.64, 1434.04)  us worthy to be in your presence and minister to you.\n(1434.04, 1439.88)  Humbly we pray that, partaking of the body and blood of Christ, we may be gathered into\n(1439.88, 1443.56)  one by the Holy Spirit.\n(1443.56, 1447.84)  Remember Lord your Church, spread throughout the world, and bring her to the fullness of\n(1447.84, 1456.84)  charity together with Leo, our Pope, and Richard, our Bishop, and all the clergy.\n(1456.84, 1465.84)  Remember your servants, Siobhan Lorway and Catherine Hayes, whom you have called from\n(1465.84, 1472.84)  this world to yourself. Granted, they, who were united with your son in a death like\n(1472.84, 1479.0)  death like his, may also be one with him in his resurrection.\n(1479.0, 1481.84)  Remember also our brothers and sisters\n(1481.84, 1485.28)  who have fallen asleep in the hope of the resurrection,\n(1485.28, 1487.96)  and all who have died in your mercy.\n(1487.96, 1492.08)  Welcome them into the light of your faith.\n(1492.08, 1496.32)  At mercy unto Saul, we pray that with the blessed Virgin Mary,\n(1496.32, 1500.2)  Mother of God, with blessed Joseph her spouse,\n(1500.2, 1502.72)  with the blessed apostles, and all the saints\n(1502.72, 1505.5)  who have pleased you throughout the ages,\n(1505.5, 1509.02)  we may merit to be coheirs to eternal life\n(1509.02, 1516.08)  and may praise and glorify you through your son, Jesus Christ.\n(1516.08, 1519.2)  Through him, and with him, and in him,\n(1519.2, 1526.76)  O God, almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\n(1526.76, 1531.76)  All glory and honor is yours forever and ever, Amen.\n(1537.56, 1541.48)  At the Savior's command, informed by divine teaching,\n(1541.48, 1545.8)  we dare to say, our Father, who art in heaven,\n(1545.8, 1547.96)  hallowed be thy name.\n(1547.96, 1551.88)  Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth\n(1551.88, 1553.6)  as it is in heaven.\n(1553.6, 1556.28)  Give us this day our daily bread\n(1556.28, 1558.78)  and forgive us our trespasses,\n(1558.78, 1562.28)  as we forgive those who trespass against us,\n(1562.28, 1565.2)  and lead us not into temptation,\n(1565.2, 1567.36)  but deliver us from evil.\n(1567.36, 1568.2)  Amen.\n(1569.52, 1572.7)  Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil.\n(1572.7, 1575.64)  Graciously grant peace in our days,\n(1575.64, 1577.64)  that by the help of your mercy,\n(1577.64, 1582.64)  we may be always free from sin and safe from all distress.\n(1582.88, 1582.64) \n(1588.64, 1592.64)  as we await the blessed hope and the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ.\n(1595.64, 1598.64)  Lord Jesus Christ, who said to your apostles, Peace I leave you, my peace I give you,\n(1598.64, 1602.64)  look not on our sins but on the faith of your Church,\n(1602.64, 1607.64)  and graciously grant her peace and unity in accordance with your will,\n(1607.64, 1610.64)  who live and reign forever and ever.\n(1610.64, 1615.2)  The peace of the Lord be with you always.\n(1615.2, 1619.28)  Let us offer each other some sign of peace.\n(1632.32, 1637.92)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1637.92, 1643.4)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1643.4, 1648.64)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, grant us peace.\n(1648.64, 1654.64)  We're mindful of all who are with us through the streaming system locally\n(1654.64, 1666.24)  and in this country of ours, all across the country, and even across the ocean.\n(1666.24, 1672.08)  They're not able to receive Holy Communion as they pray with us in their homes,\n(1672.08, 1678.64)  and so the Church is anxious for us to help them make a spiritual act of communion, which we do.\n(1678.64, 1685.92)  Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the living God, who by the will of the Father and the work of the Holy Spirit,\n(1685.92, 1689.04)  through your death gave life to the world.\n(1689.04, 1696.04)  Free us by this, your most holy body and blood, from all our sins and from every evil.\n(1696.04, 1706.04)  Keep us always faithful to your commandments and never let us be parted from you.\n(1706.04, 1713.04)  Behold the Lamb of God, behold him who takes away the sins of the world.\n(1713.04, 1717.04)  Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb.\n(1717.04, 1726.04)  Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof, but only say the word and my soul shall be healed.\n(1747.04, 1775.04)  Okay, let's see if we can turn the light on.\n(1775.04, 1802.4)  The communion verse for today.\n(1802.4, 1809.4)  Blessed is the womb of the Virgin Mary, which bore the Son of the Eternal Father.\n(1832.4, 1860.8)  The body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body\n(1860.8, 1875.8)  the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body\n(1875.8, 1889.8)  of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ,\n(1949.8, 1956.8)  All right, we're going to go ahead and take a few minutes and then we're going to go ahead\n(1979.8, 1981.8)  Okay, I'm going to go ahead and close the session.\n(2009.8, 2023.8)  As always, I ask you to please remember the priests at Virginia Cleary, four of them are in the hospital.\n(2023.8, 2037.8)  The fourth one is my own brother who lives at Virginia Cleary as well as I do, a priest for the last 55 years he is.\n(2037.8, 2042.2)  And he was taken yesterday, and it was an emergency.\n(2042.2, 2045.72)  And I ask you to please pray for all of those priests,\n(2045.72, 2049.54)  and especially members from my brother.\n(2049.54, 2053.32)  I wanted to just tell you something\n(2053.32, 2055.74)  that you wouldn't know if I didn't tell you.\n(2055.74, 2060.8)  Last week, I celebrated the Mass on Wednesday, as I do today.\n(2060.8, 2064.3)  And before I could get to my car,\n(2064.3, 2067.98)  My phone had a message, texted,\n(2069.12, 2072.08)  and it was from very close friends in Ireland,\n(2072.94, 2074.68)  a young married couple I've known\n(2074.68, 2077.38)  since before they were married years ago,\n(2077.38, 2080.1)  and they're over 50 years married now.\n(2080.1, 2083.14)  And they just texted me to tell me\n(2083.14, 2087.54)  that they had just watched and celebrated with us here,\n(2088.46, 2093.22)  the mass that I had celebrated a few minutes before.\n(2094.18, 2093.22) \n(2100.22, 2103.42)  So when I ask you to pray for those in the streaming system who are listening to us,\n(2107.94, 2114.94)  and I tell you that it's all over the world, I thought it was unusual that there should be such a definite and immediate proof of what I said. It's a wonderful thing when you\n(2116.62, 2121.86)  think that we can celebrate the Eucharist year together, and we don't know how far that's\n(2121.86, 2128.86)  But this is the evidence of how far it is when you can think that somebody in Ireland,\n(2128.86, 2136.86)  five hours later than we are here, actually celebrated that Mass in their home with us.\n(2136.86, 2140.86)  So it's a great thing, this streaming system.\n(2140.86, 2147.86)  And we pray especially for all those whom we don't even know, perhaps, or maybe we do,\n(2147.86, 2154.86)  do who are with us in celebrating the Eucharist through that system. Thank you for coming\n(2155.3, 2162.3)  to pray with us today. I hope you have a good and a safe and a happy day. Let us pray.\n(2170.02, 2177.02)  As we receive this Heavenly Sacrament, we beseech, O Lord, your mercy that we who do\n(2177.86, 2185.9)  Joyce in commemorating the Blessed Virgin Mary may, by imitating her, serve worthily\n(2185.9, 2192.08)  the mystery of our redemption through Christ our Lord.\n(2192.08, 2195.82)  The Lord be with you.\n(2195.82, 2202.68)  May God, who through the childbearing of the Blessed Virgin Mary willed in his great kindness\n(2202.68, 2204.76)  to redeem the human race.\n(2204.76, 2209.14)  Be pleased to enrich us with his blessing.\n(2209.14, 2213.6)  And may we know always and everywhere the protection\n(2213.6, 2221.92)  of her through whom we have been found worthy to receive\n(2221.92, 2223.64)  the author of life.\n(2223.64, 2225.16)  Amen.\n(2225.16, 2228.68)  May you who have devoutly gathered on this day\n(2228.68, 2236.28)  carry away with you the gifts of spiritual joys and heavenly rewards. Amen and may the blessing\n(2236.28, 2244.44)  of almighty god the father and the son and the holy spirit come down upon all of you and remain\n(2244.44, 2250.68)  with you forever. The mass has ended. Let us go in peace to law.\n",

        "transcript": "(268.0, 277.64)  Good morning, everyone.\n(277.64, 283.84)  In your prayers today, we'd ask you to remember Stephen Baxter, for whom this Mass is offered.\n(283.84, 288.72)  In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, the grace of our Lord\n(288.72, 293.28)  Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with all of\n(293.28, 295.84)  you.\n(295.84, 301.08)  Today we celebrate the Feast of St. Thomas, Apostle, as we honor St. Thomas today we take\n(301.08, 306.16)  a moment asking the Lord's forgiveness.\n(306.16, 313.32)  Lord have mercy, Christ have mercy, Lord have mercy.\n(313.32, 320.18)  May Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us our sins and bring us to everlasting life.\n(320.18, 325.32)  Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace to people of good will.\n(325.32, 329.86)  We praise you, we bless you, we adore you, we glorify you.\n(329.86, 336.84)  We give you thanks for your great glory, Lord God, Heavenly King, O God Almighty Father.\n(336.84, 343.66)  Lord Jesus Christ, Only Begotten Son, Lord God, Lamb of God, Son of the Father, you take\n(343.66, 347.2)  away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(347.2, 351.2)  You take away the sins of the world, receive our prayer.\n(351.2, 355.8)  You are seated at the right hand of the Father, have mercy on us.\n(355.8, 360.88)  For you alone are the Holy One, you alone are the Lord, you alone are the Most High,\n(360.88, 367.44)  Jesus Christ, with the Holy Spirit, in the glory of God the Father, Amen.\n(367.44, 372.08)  Let us pray.\n(372.08, 378.78)  Grant Almighty God that we may glory in the feast of the blessed Apostle Thomas, so that\n(378.78, 385.78)  That we may always be sustained by his intercession and believing may have life in the name of\n(385.78, 392.94)  Jesus Christ, your Son, whom Thomas acknowledged as the Lord, who lives and reigns with you\n(392.94, 415.38)  you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.\n(415.38, 420.18)  A reading from the letter of St. Paul to the Ephesians.\n(420.18, 427.0)  Brothers and sisters, you are no longer strangers and sojourners, but you are fellow citizens\n(427.0, 434.34)  with the Holy Ones and members of the household of God, built upon the foundation of the apostles\n(434.34, 441.68)  and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the capstone.\n(441.68, 448.94)  Through him the whole structure is held together and grows into a temple, sacred and the Lord.\n(448.94, 455.68)  In him you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in the Spirit.\n(455.68, 460.14)  The word of the Lord.\n(460.14, 467.56)  Go out to all the world and tell the good news.\n(467.56, 475.82)  Praise the Lord all you nations, glorify him all you peoples.\n(475.82, 478.5)  For steadfast is his kindness for us,\n(478.5, 481.16)  and the fidelity of the Lord endures forever.\n(505.46, 481.16) \n(510.92, 519.4)  The Lord be with you. John. Thomas, called Didymus, one of the twelve, was not with them when Jesus came,\n(519.4, 525.76)  so the other disciples said to him, we have seen the Lord. But Thomas said to\n(525.76, 531.36)  them, unless I see the mark of the nails in his hands, and put my finger into the\n(531.36, 539.32)  nail marks, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe. Now a week later his\n(539.32, 545.42)  disciples were again inside and Thomas was with them. Jesus came, although the\n(545.42, 552.08)  doors were locked, and stood in their midst and said peace be with you. Then he\n(552.08, 558.56)  said to Thomas put your finger here and see my hands and bring your hand and put\n(558.56, 565.6)  it into my side and do not be unbelieving but believe. Thomas answered\n(565.6, 570.34)  and said to him, my Lord and my God.\n(570.44, 573.14)  Jesus said to him, have you come to believe\n(573.24, 575.82)  because you have seen me?\n(575.92, 581.02)  Blessed are those who have not seen and have believed.\n(581.12, 582.92)  The Gospel of the Lord.\n(583.02, 584.42)  Praise be to the Lord.\n(588.76, 592.1)  As we celebrate this feast of St. Thomas the Apostle,\n(592.2, 592.1) \n(599.26, 603.22)  He's often remembered as doubting Thomas, of course, but I think more rightly he should be honored as believing Thomas.\n(603.22, 609.74)  The Gospel brings us to that upper room one week after Easter, after the resurrection\n(609.74, 612.02)  of Christ.\n(612.02, 617.72)  The other disciples had already seen the risen Lord, but Thomas had not and he couldn't believe\n(617.72, 618.72)  just yet.\n(618.72, 625.24)  He said, unless I see the mark of the nails, I will not believe.\n(625.24, 633.92)  We often hear this as a rebuke, but if we look closely, we can see that Thomas' doubt\n(633.92, 635.96)  was not the end of the story.\n(635.96, 640.88)  It was the beginning of, really, a deeper faith.\n(640.88, 646.62)  When Jesus appears again and invites Thomas to touch his wounds, Thomas responds, not\n(646.62, 651.94)  Not just with belief, but with the highest confession of faith.\n(651.94, 655.54)  My Lord and my God.\n(655.54, 659.58)  And that moment wasn't just about proof, it was about relationship.\n(659.58, 663.9)  Jesus didn't shame Thomas.\n(663.9, 671.58)  He met him in his doubts, with mercy and patience, just as he meets all of us.\n(671.58, 676.02)  Many of us carry doubts or wounds also.\n(676.02, 682.74)  Maybe we struggle to believe that Christ is truly present in our suffering, or even in\n(682.74, 688.52)  the Eucharist that we celebrate this morning, or doubts of faith as we live out our daily\n(688.52, 689.52)  lives.\n(689.52, 694.9)  But Thomas reminds us that doubt is not the enemy of faith.\n(694.9, 700.0)  It can be the doorway, really, to a greater faith.\n(700.0, 706.0)  If we bring our doubts to the Lord with honesty and an open heart, He'll meet us there all\n(706.0, 715.68)  also. What does Jesus say in today's gospel, blessed are those who have not seen and have\n(715.68, 723.24)  believed. That's us. Blessed are those who have not seen and have believed. We haven't\n(723.24, 730.04)  seen the risen Christ with our eyes, but we believe because he has touched our lives in\n(730.04, 732.24)  in so many ways.\n(732.24, 734.52)  Every time we come to this altar,\n(734.52, 738.68)  we echo Thomas' words, my Lord and my God.\n(738.68, 741.2)  We say them not because we see,\n(741.2, 743.54)  but because we trust and have faith.\n(745.28, 750.24)  Maybe we can ask St. Thomas today to pray for us,\n(750.24, 753.8)  that our doubts may lead to a deeper faith\n(754.8, 756.98)  and that our belief may always be rooted\n(756.98, 767.32)  personal encounter with the real Jesus Christ. Let us pray. With confidence, we\n(767.32, 772.48)  entrust our prayers to our merciful Father. We pray for church leaders. May\n(772.48, 777.02)  God guide and protect them as they shepherd the church, we pray to the\n(777.02, 784.44)  Lord. For those suffering unjust treatment or discrimination, may Jesus\n(784.44, 791.86)  bring them justice and healing according to his will, we pray to the Lord.\n(791.86, 797.5)  For the members of our community here in South Boston, may God unite us as one household\n(797.5, 802.64)  in the Spirit of God, we pray to the Lord.\n(802.64, 807.68)  For all the sick, those in hospital or nursing home, those undergoing surgery or treatment\n(807.68, 814.36)  today that God's healing presence may be with them, we pray to the Lord.\n(814.36, 819.72)  For all those who have died marked with the sign of faith, and today we remember Stephen\n(819.72, 822.32)  Baxter for whom this Mass is offered.\n(822.32, 829.4)  May the mercy and love of God guide them into eternal life, we pray to the Lord.\n(829.4, 835.36)  Father, please hear these prayers we offer through Christ our Lord.\n(859.4, 872.88)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through your goodness we have received\n(872.88, 877.7)  the bread we offer you, fruit of the earth and work of human hands, it will become for\n(877.7, 882.18)  us the bread of life.\n(882.18, 886.12)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through your goodness we have received\n(886.12, 888.64)  the wine we offer you, fruit of the vine,\n(888.64, 889.96)  and work of human hands,\n(889.96, 892.36)  it will become our spiritual drink.\n(908.12, 911.42)  Pray, brothers and sisters, that my sacrifice and yours\n(911.42, 914.54)  may be acceptable to God, the almighty Father.\n(916.12, 929.0)  We render you, O Lord, the service that is yours due, humbly imploring you to keep safe\n(929.0, 934.8)  your gifts in us as we honor the confession of the Apostle St. Thomas and offer you a\n(934.8, 939.08)  sacrifice of praise through Christ our Lord.\n(939.08, 941.72)  The Lord be with you.\n(941.72, 944.42)  Lift up your hearts.\n(944.42, 949.02)  Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.\n(949.02, 954.26)  It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, always and everywhere, to give\n(954.26, 959.14)  you thanks, Lord, Holy Father, Almighty and Eternal God.\n(959.14, 964.38)  For you, eternal shepherd, do not desert your flock, but through the blessed apostles watch\n(964.38, 970.02)  over it and protect it always, so that it may be governed by those you have appointed\n(970.02, 973.68)  shepherds to lead it in the name of your Son.\n(973.68, 978.48)  And so with angels and archangels, we sing the hymn of your glory, as without end we\n(978.48, 984.88)  now acclaim, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts, heaven\n(984.88, 990.0)  and earth are full of your glory, Hosanna in the highest.\n(990.0, 997.4)  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, Hosanna in the highest.\n(997.4, 1001.3)  You are indeed holy, O Lord, the fount of all holiness.\n(1001.3, 1005.94)  holy therefore these gifts we pray by sending down your spirit upon them like\n(1005.94, 1011.68)  the dewfall so that they may become for us the body and blood of our Lord Jesus\n(1011.68, 1018.26)  Christ at the time he was betrayed and entered willingly into his passion he\n(1018.26, 1023.58)  took bread and giving thanks broke it and gave it to his disciples saying take\n(1023.58, 1029.34)  this all of you and eat of it for this is my body which will be given up for\n(1029.34, 1041.8)  you in a similar way when supper was ended he took the chalice and once more\n(1041.8, 1046.5)  giving thanks he gave it to his disciples saying take this all of you and\n(1046.5, 1050.8)  drink from it for this is the chalice of my blood the blood of the new and\n(1050.8, 1054.96)  eternal covenant which will be poured out for you and for many for the\n(1054.96, 1060.88)  forgiveness of sins. Do this in memory of me.\"\n(1067.6, 1074.12)  The mystery of faith. When we eat this bread and drink this cup, we proclaim\n(1074.12, 1080.16)  your death, O Lord, until you come again. Therefore, as we celebrate the memorial\n(1080.16, 1083.96)  of his death and resurrection, we offer you, Lord, the bread of life and the\n(1083.96, 1088.92)  chalice of salvation, giving thanks that you have held us worthy to be in your\n(1088.92, 1094.44)  presence and minister to you. Humbly we pray that partaking of the body and\n(1094.44, 1099.2)  blood of Christ we may be gathered into one by the Holy Spirit.\n(1099.2, 1103.92)  Remember Lord your church spread throughout the world and bring her to\n(1103.92, 1108.76)  the fullness of charity together with Leo our Pope and Richard our Bishop and\n(1108.76, 1114.26)  all the clergy. Remember also our brothers and sisters who have fallen\n(1114.26, 1118.72)  asleep in the hope of the resurrection, and all who have died in your mercy.\n(1118.72, 1124.84)  Welcome them into the light of your face, and have mercy on us all, we pray, that\n(1124.84, 1129.88)  with the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God, St. Joseph, her spouse, with the\n(1129.88, 1135.32)  Blessed Apostles, St. Thomas, St. Bridget, St. Augustine, and all the Saints who\n(1135.32, 1138.02)  who have pleased you throughout the ages,\n(1138.02, 1141.36)  that we may merit to be co-heirs to eternal life,\n(1141.36, 1143.24)  and may praise and glorify you\n(1143.24, 1145.72)  through your Son, Jesus Christ.\n(1148.14, 1150.28)  Through him and with him and in him,\n(1150.28, 1153.5)  O God, almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\n(1153.5, 1157.4)  all glory and honor is yours forever and ever.\n(1162.04, 1164.88)  At the Savior's command and formed by divine teaching,\n(1164.88, 1169.28)  we dare to pray now, our Father, who art in heaven,\n(1169.28, 1171.06)  hallowed be thy name.\n(1171.06, 1173.82)  Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,\n(1173.82, 1176.16)  on earth as it is in heaven.\n(1176.16, 1178.84)  Give us this day our daily bread,\n(1178.84, 1181.28)  and forgive us our trespasses,\n(1181.28, 1184.72)  as we forgive those who trespass against us,\n(1184.72, 1189.6)  and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.\n(1189.6, 1192.32)  Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil,\n(1192.32, 1194.54)  graciously grant peace in our days,\n(1194.54, 1196.78)  that by the help of your mercy,\n(1196.78, 1200.82)  we may be always free from sin and safe from all distress\n(1200.82, 1202.34)  as we await the blessed hope\n(1202.34, 1205.34)  and the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ.\n(1205.34, 1209.34)  In the kingdom of God, the glory is yours now.\n(1209.34, 1211.86)  Lord Jesus Christ, who said to your apostles,\n(1211.86, 1214.54)  peace I leave you, my peace I give you,\n(1214.54, 1217.86)  look not now on our sins, but on the faith of your church,\n(1217.86, 1220.22)  and graciously grant her peace and unity\n(1220.22, 1221.66)  in accordance with your will,\n(1221.66, 1225.0)  who live and reign forever and ever.\n(1225.0, 1227.8)  The peace of the Lord be with you always.\n(1228.76, 1231.92)  Let's offer each other some sign of Christ's peace.\n(1239.84, 1243.82)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world,\n(1243.82, 1245.62)  have mercy on us.\n(1245.62, 1249.34)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world,\n(1249.34, 1251.34)  have mercy on us.\n(1251.34, 1254.98)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world.\n(1254.98, 1256.62)  Grant us peace.\n(1258.34, 1259.98)  Behold, the Lamb of God.\n(1259.98, 1263.42)  Behold Him who takes away the sins of the world.\n(1263.42, 1266.66)  Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb.\n(1266.66, 1270.5)  Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof,\n(1270.5, 1273.7)  but only say the word and my soul shall be healed.\n(1401.34, 1408.34)  So, thank you very much for your attention.\n(1461.34, 1479.42)  Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.\n(1479.42, 1484.42)  Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.\n(1484.42, 1489.7)  Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death.\n(1489.7, 1490.7)  Amen.\n(1490.7, 1498.56)  pray.

now.\n(296.0, 301.0)  Okay, it's on.\n(323.84, 325.88)  Good morning, everyone.\n(325.88, 328.88)  to be with you this day as we prepare for the 4th of July.\n(328.98, 331.22)  Let us ask the Lord to strengthen us in God's grace\n(331.32, 334.22)  this morning as we celebrate the Feast of St. Thomas\n(334.32, 335.46)  the Apostle.\n(335.56, 337.02)  He's known as Doubting Thomas.\n(337.12, 339.5)  And for us this morning, it's asking God\n(339.6, 342.16)  to help us with our spiritual blindness.\n(342.26, 344.06)  What sometimes are the things in our life\n(344.16, 346.46)  that we fail to see in Christ?\n(346.56, 349.1)  And that in our doubts, sometimes it overwhelms us.\n(349.2, 351.94)  So this morning, as we pray to St. Thomas,\n(352.04, 351.94) \n(356.58, 356.68)  we see in his wounds that he showed to the apostles,\n(359.72, 359.82)  to St. Thomas, that it changes our whole meaning of life\n(364.42, 364.52)  when we see the wounds that he carried from the crucifixion\n(365.76, 365.86)  to everyday life.\n(368.8, 368.9)  In the name of the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit, amen.\n(372.16, 372.26)  Our mass is celebrated for the parishioners of the parish\n(374.56, 374.66)

of the Holy Spirit be with all of you.\n(383.28, 385.2)  Loving God, as we come before you this day,\n(385.2, 388.54)  we ask that you prepare us in thanksgiving for our sins\n(388.54, 390.84)  as we celebrate these sacred mysteries.\n(390.84, 392.74)  Lord, have mercy.\n(392.74, 394.4)  Christ, have mercy.\n(394.4, 396.1)  Lord, have mercy.\n(396.1, 398.32)  May Almighty God have mercy on us.\n(398.32, 399.96)  May the Lord forgive us our sins\n(399.96, 402.54)  and bring us to everlasting life.\n(402.54, 406.14)  On the solemnity of St. Thomas, we pray today the Gloria.\n(406.14,

seated at the right hand of the father,\n(434.14, 437.38)  have mercy on us, for you alone are the holy one,\n(437.38, 438.76)  You alone are the Lord.\n(438.76, 441.14)  You alone are the most high, Jesus Christ,\n(441.14, 445.4)  with the Holy Spirit, in the glory of God the Father, amen.\n(445.4, 448.06)  Let us pause and ask the Lord to strengthen us this day\n(448.06, 450.26)  in our prayer, that God will grace us,\n(450.26, 454.1)  and we pray for those that carry heavy wounds or scars.\n(454.1, 457.06)  Maybe in your own life, we ask the Lord to be attentive\n(457.06, 459.34)  to our cry for healing this day.\n(461.34, 465.42)  Oh God, by your wonderful gift of mercy, oh Lord,\n(465.42, 467.58)  that we may glorify you in the feast\n(467.58, 469.62)  of the blessed apostle Thomas,\n(469.62, 473.26)  so that we may always be sustained by his intercession,\n(473.26, 474.82)  and believing may have life\n(474.82, 477.5)  in the name of Jesus Christ, your son,\n(477.5, 479.94)  whom Thomas acknowledges the Lord,\n(479.94, 481.5)  who lives and reigns with you\n(481.5, 485.54)  in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\n(485.54, 489.62)  one God, forever and ever, amen.\n(489.62, 490.44)  Please be seated.\n(490.44, 492.76)  Let us now be attentive to God's sacred word.\n(495.42, 505.5)  A reading from the Letter of St. Paul to the Ephesians.\n(505.5, 512.74)  Brothers and sisters, you are no longer strangers and sojourners, but you are fellow citizens\n(512.74, 519.58)  with the Holy Ones and members of the household of God, built upon the foundation of the apostles\n(519.58, 525.82)  and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the capstone.\n(525.82, 533.04)  Through him the whole structure is held together and grows into a temple sacred in the Lord.\n(533.04, 541.68)  In him you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in the Spirit.\n(541.68, 542.68)  The word of the Lord.\n(542.68, 544.76)  Thanks be to God.\n(544.76, 547.04)  The Responsorial Psalm.\n(547.04, 550.84)  Go out to all the world and tell the good news.\n(550.84, 554.0)  Go out to all the world and tell the good news.\n(554.0, 556.7)  Praise the Lord, all you nations.\n(556.7, 559.16)  Glorify him, all you peoples.\n(560.12, 562.88)  Go out to all the world and tell the good news.\n(562.88, 566.6)  For steadfast is his kindness for us,\n(566.6, 570.4)  and the fidelity of the Lord endures forever.\n(570.4, 573.16)  Go out to all the world and tell the good news.\n(574.76, 592.68)  My friends, the Lord be with you.\n(592.68, 596.72)  Reading from the Holy Gospel according to John.\n(596.72, 602.08)  Thomas, called Iamis, one of the twelve, was not with them when Jesus came.\n(602.08, 608.32)  So the other disciples said to him we have seen the Lord but Thomas said to them unless\n(608.32, 614.96)  I see the mark of nails in his hands and put my finger into his kneel marks and put my\n(614.96, 618.76)  hand into his side I will not believe.\n(618.76, 624.0)  Now a week later his disciples were again inside and Thomas was with them.\n(624.0, 630.8)  Jesus came although the doors were locked and stood in their midst and said peace be\n(630.8, 639.78)  with you. Then he said to Thomas, put your finger here and see my hands. Bring your hand\n(639.78, 651.78)  and put it into my side. And do not be unbelieving, but believe. Thomas answered and said to him,\n(651.78, 653.78)  my Lord and my God\n(655.18, 660.34)  Jesus said to him have you come to believe because you have seen me\n(663.02, 671.42)  Blessed are those who have not seen I believe gospel of the Lord\n(674.38, 680.86)  I'm well prepared this morning because I had the taping of the TV mass for today, so I'm very prepared\n(681.22, 680.86) \n(685.36, 687.56)  But at the Mass yesterday, I asked ahead of time, could I bring my Caravaggio?\n(687.56, 690.36)  Caravaggio, you know, was one of those great artists.\n(690.36, 692.0)  And someone said, you have a Caravaggio?\n(692.0, 693.76)  Oh, I have a Caravaggio.\n(693.76, 696.64)  It probably would be about $20 million if I really had it.\n(696.64, 699.08)  And it's really Thomas, and I'm gonna put it there,\n(699.08, 701.28)  you can see it if you like, after Mass.\n(701.28, 703.68)  It's Thomas looking at Jesus.\n(703.68, 704.88)  You can't see it from there.\n(704.88, 706.68)  But they did see it on TV.\n(706.68, 708.04)  They took a closeup of it.\n(708.04, 711.04)  And there's Jesus and Thomas and the other disciples\n(711.04, 712.72)  are looking down.\n(712.72, 716.96)  And the beautiful gift of the picture by Caravaggio, 1645,\n(716.96, 721.96)  what he does is that he's looking at the wounds of Jesus\n(722.68, 726.48)  and he takes his finger and puts it into the wound.\n(727.4, 729.76)  The wound is still open.\n(731.14, 736.14)  The theme today in the reading after Easter now\n(736.36, 736.14) \n(742.42, 742.48)  is that Jesus showed his wounds to them, to us,\n(747.36, 747.42)  so we could show him our wounds,\n(749.86, 749.92)  that we could show him our wounds,\n(752.46, 752.52)  our pain and our suffering.\n(755.9, 755.96)  Today, we look at the two or three things that,\n(758.54, 758.6)  after Easter, we said, you know, Easter lasts a lifetime.\n(760.54, 760.6)  It just doesn't last 50 days.\n(763.54, 763.6)  We see it now in this beautiful image of Thomas,\n(764.54, 764.6)  doubting Thomas.\n(764.54, 767.54)  How many times have we said, oh, give me a sign.\n(767.54, 768.62)  I don't believe.\n(768.62, 769.42)  I don't see it.\n(769.42, 771.42)  I don't understand it.\n(771.42, 773.74)  Jesus knows we're always going to struggle.\n(773.74, 777.1)  That's why he invites the disciples to see,\n(777.1, 782.38)  to touch, to hear, that his witness, the fact\n(782.38, 784.62)  that after the Resurrection, he still\n(784.62, 789.54)  has the scars and the wounds from crucifixion,\n(789.54, 791.74)  it made his identity known.\n(791.74, 793.62)  He wasn't a ghost.\n(793.62, 795.62)  They did not expect that.\n(795.62, 799.66)  And then the second aspect is that Jesus reminds us\n(799.66, 802.76)  of the sacrifice of the cross.\n(802.76, 806.06)  This is who I have been for you,\n(806.06, 810.64)  and your wounds are just as real and can be glorified.\n(810.64, 813.62)  The wounds were there to show the identity\n(813.62, 815.72)  of how he suffered for us.\n(815.72, 817.68)  So when we're thinking about pain and suffering,\n(817.68, 819.7)  and many people have many wounds\n(819.7, 822.26)  that we would not want to carry,\n(822.26, 824.12)  we look at the beautiful prayer\n(824.12, 829.12)  that comes from Saint Ignatius on a 30-day retreat.\n(829.5, 831.36)  And people don't believe this,\n(831.36, 835.86)  but I did do a 30-day silent retreat, and it was wonderful.\n(835.86, 838.98)  I was ordained about maybe 42 years,\n(838.98, 840.94)  and it was at Saint Buenos in Wales,\n(840.94, 843.58)  the Jesuit Center in Spirituality.\n(843.58, 846.46)  And at the beginning of the four weeks,\n(846.46, 849.74)  there's a beautiful prayer that Saint Ignatius uses.\n(849.74, 853.38)  is called the soul of Christ, the soul of Christ.\n(853.38, 855.02)  Listen to these beautiful words,\n(855.02, 858.18)  and then I'll conclude my homily this morning.\n(858.18, 860.78)  But I think it says everything about opening\n(860.78, 862.3)  and touching the wounds of Christ\n(862.3, 864.84)  so we can share our wounds with him.\n(866.18, 868.74)  Saint Ignatius, at the opening prayer\n(868.74, 871.44)  of the Spiritual Exercises for four weeks\n(871.44, 874.22)  on consolation and desolation,\n(874.22, 878.42)  in, he says to us through the prayer of the soul of Christ,\n(878.42, 880.44)  In your wounds, hide me.\n(881.34, 885.56)  Through prayer, open my wounds to the crucifixion\n(885.56, 890.32)  so that they can become a hiding place in my pain.\n(891.24, 895.88)  Give me refuge in the fountain of your grace and love\n(895.88, 898.48)  with my woundedness that I carry with me.\n(899.36, 903.16)  The wounds we suffer can find purpose\n(903.16, 908.16)  in the wounds of Jesus, who still bears those wounds.\n(908.42, 911.9)  Seeing his hand, his feet, his side,\n(911.9, 915.54)  we can be united in Christ's sacrifice,\n(915.54, 917.62)  for out of our salvation,\n(917.62, 921.1)  we come to see the salvation of Christ.\n(921.1, 924.9)  Our wounds can certainly be healed,\n(924.9, 929.9)  but even better, like Christ, they have been glorified.\n(930.78, 935.22)  The cross represents, and we focus on this all the time,\n(935.22, 939.78)  life, death, resurrection, the glorification of Jesus.\n(939.78, 942.38)  Through the power of the resurrection,\n(942.38, 947.38)  all those wounds that we carry are made known in Christ.\n(948.78, 951.18)  But the wounds of every day can be brought to them\n(951.18, 953.78)  just as they are in our death.\n(953.78, 957.3)  So let us stand now and pray this day for our prayers.\n(957.3, 959.18)  We pray for all of you gathered here\n(959.18, 962.38)  in your faith to stay and for all the wounds that we carry,\n(962.38, 965.62)  but how we help others find Christ in healing\n(965.72, 967.76)  their brokenness and pain in family life,\n(967.86, 970.26)  we pray to the Lord.\n(970.36, 973.86)  Let us pray for the 4th of July upon us, our nation\n(973.96, 976.36)  and our nation, and all those that serve our country\n(976.46, 978.16)  over the many years, for all those\n(978.26, 983.68)  that travel to be with friends and family on 4th of July day,\n(983.78, 986.34)  we pray to the Lord.\n(986.44, 988.14)  For the members of the community of faith\n(988.24, 991.72)  that they may be united with the gift of the Holy Spirit\n(991.82, 991.72) \n(994.92, 995.02)  in their faith life, we pray to the Lord.\n(997.66, 997.76)  For families and individuals and our young people\n(999.36, 999.46)  and all those that are struggling\n(1002.7, 1002.8)  with the crisis of economy and unemployment\n(1006.16, 1006.26)  and disappointment and all the things of the world that\n(1012.44, 1012.54)  do not focus on hope and healing, we pray to the Lord.\n(1016.48, 1016.58)  For all have died and marked out for God's mercy.\n(1018.38, 1018.48)  May they rest in peace as we pray.\n(1021.04, 1021.14)  For the parishioners and all you this morning at mass,\n(1021.04, 1026.36)  we pray to the Lord and the almighty God bless us as we join with Thomas our\n(1026.36, 1031.76)  apostle asking him to heal our spiritual blindness that we may believe even\n(1031.76, 1036.48)  stronger after we receive the Eucharist the body of Christ amen please be\n(1036.48, 1038.76)  seated\n(1111.04, 1118.04)  Pray, my brothers and sisters, that the sacrifice may be accepted by the Father, and by the\n(1141.04, 1143.3)  to God the almighty Father.\n(1151.48, 1154.56)  We render you, O Lord, the service that is due,\n(1154.56, 1158.24)  humbly imploring you to keep us safe with your gifts in us,\n(1158.24, 1161.32)  that we honor the confession of the Apostle Saint Thomas\n(1161.32, 1163.86)  and offer you a sacrifice of praise\n(1163.86, 1166.76)  through Christ Jesus our Lord.\n(1166.76, 1169.36)  My friends, the Lord be with you.\n(1169.36, 1171.4)  Lift up your hearts.\n(1171.4, 1173.94)  Let us give thanks to the Lord, our God.\n(1175.2, 1178.76)  It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,\n(1178.76, 1181.72)  always and everywhere to give you thanks,\n(1181.72, 1185.04)  Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God.\n(1185.04, 1188.48)  For you are eternal shepherd, do not desert your flock,\n(1188.48, 1189.96)  but through the blessed apostles,\n(1189.96, 1192.48)  watch over it and protect it always,\n(1192.48, 1194.28)  so that it may be governed by those\n(1194.28, 1196.08)  who have appointed as shepherds\n(1196.08, 1198.4)  to lead us in the name of your Son.\n(1198.4, 1200.8)  And so with the angels and archangels,\n(1200.8, 1202.48)  with thrones and dominions,\n(1202.48, 1204.76)  with all the hosts of powers of heaven,\n(1204.76, 1206.72)  we sing the hymn of your glory,\n(1206.72, 1208.8)  as without end we acclaim.\n(1208.8, 1212.42)  Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts,\n(1212.42, 1214.68)  heaven and earth are full of your glory,\n(1214.68, 1216.4)  Hosanna in the highest.\n(1216.4, 1219.04)  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord,\n(1219.04, 1220.68)  Hosanna in the highest.\n(1223.94, 1227.2)  You are indeed holy, O Lord, the fount of all holiness.\n(1227.2, 1232.2)  Make holy these gifts, we pray, by sending down your Spirit upon them like the dewfall,\n(1232.2, 1238.2)  that they may become for us the body and blood of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.\n(1238.2, 1243.2)  At the time he was betrayed and entered willingly into his passion,\n(1243.2, 1247.2)  he took bread and giving thanks, broke it, gave it to his disciples, saying,\n(1247.2, 1253.2)  Take this, all of you, and eat of it, for this is my body, which will be given up for you.\n(1257.2, 1266.08)  In a similar way, when Sephah was entered, he took the chalice.\n(1266.08, 1270.72)  Once more giving thanks, he gave it to his disciples, saying take this, all of you, and\n(1270.72, 1271.72)  drink from it.\n(1271.72, 1276.64)  For this is the chalice of my blood, the blood of the new and eternal covenant, which will\n(1276.64, 1281.88)  be put out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins.\n(1281.88, 1285.04)  Do this in memory of me.\n(1285.04, 1298.64)  The mystery of faith, when we eat this bread and drink this cup, we proclaim your death\n(1298.64, 1302.24)  O Lord until you come again.\n(1302.24, 1307.32)  Therefore as we celebrate the memorial of his death and resurrection, we offer you Lord\n(1307.32, 1314.08)  the bread of life and the chalice of salvation, giving thanks that you've held us worthy to\n(1314.08, 1317.36)  be in your presence and minister to you.\n(1318.24, 1321.88)  Humbly we pray that partaking of the body and blood\n(1321.88, 1326.4)  of Christ we may be gathered into one by the Holy Spirit.\n(1326.4, 1329.76)  Remember, Lord, your church spread throughout the world.\n(1329.76, 1331.4)  Bring her to the fullness of charity,\n(1331.4, 1334.0)  together with Leo, your servant, our Pope,\n(1334.0, 1336.24)  our Bishop Richard, and all the clergy.\n(1336.24, 1338.68)  Remember the parishioners of this parish,\n(1338.68, 1341.4)  your families, and all those that we pray for\n(1341.4, 1344.32)  the healing grace today through Saint Thomas the Apostle.\n(1353.0, 1355.84)  Remember also our brothers and sisters\n(1355.84, 1359.4)  who have fallen asleep in the hope of the resurrection,\n(1359.4, 1362.48)  and all who have died in your mercy.\n(1362.48, 1366.28)  Welcome them into the light of your face.\n(1366.28, 1368.48)  Have mercy on us all, we pray,\n(1368.48, 1371.18)  with the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God,\n(1371.18, 1374.68)  Joseph, her chaste spouse, with the apostles Thomas,\n(1374.68, 1378.4)  Saint Augustine Parish, Saint Bridget, Gate of Heaven,\n(1378.4, 1380.34)  and all the saints you have been pleased with\n(1380.34, 1383.36)  throughout the ages, that we may merit to be coheirs\n(1383.36, 1387.66)  to eternal life, and praise and glorify you\n(1387.66, 1390.24)  through your Son, Jesus Christ.\n(1391.7, 1396.2)  Through him, with him, in him, O God, almighty Father,\n(1396.2, 1400.76)  in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\n(1400.76, 1405.76)  All glory and honor is yours, forever and ever.\n(1407.48, 1408.32)  Amen.\n(1416.92, 1420.56)  At the Savior's command, informed by divine teaching,\n(1420.56, 1424.68)  we dare to say, our Father, God in Heaven,\n(1424.68, 1426.36)  hallowed be thy name.\n(1426.36, 1429.32)  Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,\n(1429.32, 1431.5)  on earth as it is in heaven.\n(1431.5, 1434.08)  Give us this day our daily bread,\n(1434.08, 1436.44)  and forgive us our trespasses,\n(1436.44, 1439.72)  as we forgive those who trespass against us,\n(1439.72, 1442.0)  and lead us not into temptation,\n(1442.0, 1444.08)  but deliver us from evil.\n(1444.08, 1447.84)  Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil.\n(1447.84, 1451.56)  Graciously grant peace in our days,\n(1451.56, 1454.06)  that by the help of your mercy,\n(1455.02, 1458.36)  we may be always free from sin.\n(1459.32, 1470.32)  Safe from all distress, as we await the blessed hope in the coming of our Savior Jesus Christ.\n(1470.32, 1475.32)  For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours, now and forever.\n(1475.32, 1478.32)  Lord Jesus Christ, who said to your apostles,\n(1478.32, 1482.32)  Peace I give you, my peace I give you.\n(1482.32, 1487.32)  Look not on our sins, but on the faith of your church,\n(1487.32, 1492.32)  and graciously grant her peace and unity\n(1493.56, 1496.36)  in accordance with your will\n(1496.36, 1499.58)  who live and reign forever and ever.\n(1500.56, 1502.88)  This beautiful day, may the peace of the Lord\n(1502.88, 1504.96)  be with you always.\n(1504.96, 1507.32)  Let us offer each other a sign of that peace.\n(1517.32, 1523.32)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1523.32, 1527.32)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1527.32, 1532.32)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, grant us peace.\n(1537.32, 1541.32)  Behold the Lamb of God, behold him who takes away the sins of the world.\n(1541.32, 1544.32)  How blessed are we who are called to the supper of the Lamb.\n(1544.32, 1550.16)  Not really should enter into my roof, but only say the word and my soul shall be healed the body and blood of christ\n(1574.32, 1595.32)  Feel around my soul, keep me here, keep me here, keep me here, keep me here, keep me\n(1595.32, 1603.32)  here, keep me here, keep me here, keep me here, keep me here, keep

Praise God\n(1768.86, 1778.86)  Make me an instrument of your peace.\n(1778.86, 1789.86)  Where there is hatred, let me bless you now.\n(1789.86, 1797.86)  Where there is injury,\n(1797.86, 1827.38)  And where there is doubting, let me bring your way.\n(1827.38, 1841.38)  And Lord, make me an instrument of your peace.\n(1841.38, 1852.38)  Where there is despairing, let me bring you home.\n(1852.38, 1862.38)  Where there is darkness, your light.\n(1862.38, 1877.38)  Where there is sadness, let me bring your joy.\n(1882.38, 1906.82)  Thank you for assisting me at the fall of the altar here.\n(1906.82, 1912.34)  I did not bring in my alb that I wear all the time that's fitted to me.\n(1912.34, 1918.98)  I got an owl from the closet and it's much longer than the one I wear so when I was coming up the\n(1918.98, 1925.62)  stairs I was very careful but then it caught the hem of it and just knocked me down. Amen.\n(1925.62, 1931.46)  So I'm very fortunate. I've had a couple of incidents this week though. I took that medication\n(1931.46, 1938.26)  for allergies and my throat was so dry at the last two masses. Father Casey called me. You are right,\n(1938.26, 1942.34)  I thought you were having a stroke your voice was so different, but I'm fine\n(1942.34, 1947.5)  It's called old age old age. I guess but I didn't I stopped taking the medication and I feel much better\n(1948.02, 1953.38)  This is not a this is a terrible season for allergies of course, but I've never had trouble but more importantly\n(1953.9, 1959.22)  St. Thomas, thank you for healing me. Amen. So let the Lord be with us this day\n(1959.22, 1963.52)  I'll be back Tuesday, hopefully and next week. I have st. Augustine on Saturday\n(1963.74, 1963.52) \n(1967.56, 1970.36)  Let's pray for all those who are watching us on TV. Oh my God, that's happened to me at home.\n(1970.36, 1971.32)  He'll never get up.\n(1971.32, 1972.84)  Well, I got up thanks to you.\n(1972.84, 1974.92)  You are the apostles today.\n(1974.92, 1977.32)  So let us ask the Lord to pray for all those\n(1977.32, 1981.08)  that don't get up or are unable to get up\n(1981.08, 1982.96)  how blessed we are to have our health\n(1982.96, 1984.76)  to the best of our ability.\n(1984.76, 1987.08)  Loving God through Saint Thomas this day,\n(1987.08, 1989.84)  you remind us that you are the way, the truth, and the light\n(1989.84, 1991.56)  and you will always lift us up\n(1991.56, 1995.3)  no matter how young or old or feeble we are, as we pray.\n(2004.98, 2008.26)  Oh God, as we truly receive in this sacrament\n(2008.26, 2010.54)  the body of your only begotten son,\n(2010.54, 2013.14)  grant we pray that we may recognize him\n(2013.14, 2015.42)  with the apostle Thomas by faith,\n(2015.42, 2017.22)  as our Lord and our God,\n(2017.22, 2020.24)  and proclaim him by our deeds and by our life,\n(2020.24, 2023.4)  who lives and reigns forever and ever, amen.\n(2023.4, 2026.48)  I'm thinking, thank God this didn't happen yesterday\n(2026.48, 2028.08)  at the TV mass.\n(2028.08, 2029.56)  I've been getting cards forever.\n(2029.56, 2032.14)  So let us pray for all those that are watching us\n(2032.14, 2034.48)  on TV today, and may the Lord bless you\n(2034.48, 2036.32)  with a wonderful holiday.\n(2036.32, 2037.4)  Let us be by our heads.\n(2037.4, 2039.32)  May the Lord bless you and keep you.\n(2039.32, 2042.04)  May his face shine upon you and be gracious to you.\n(2042.04, 2044.44)  Bless you in the name of the Father, the Son,\n(2044.44, 2046.24)  and the Holy Spirit, amen.\n(2046.24, 2047.34)  Our celebration is ended.\n(2047.34, 2049.44)  Let us go in the peace of Christ.\n(2049.44, 2050.84)  Thanks be to God.\n(2050.84, 2053.16)  First thing I'm gonna do is get a cup of coffee\n(2053.16, 2054.56)  on my way home.\n(2054.56, 2057.48)  Have a good day, see you next Tuesday, amen.\n(2068.64, 2070.68)  I'll leave that there if you want to see St. Thomas\n(2070.68, 2071.8)  and his healing, amen.\n(2079.44, 2081.48)  Oh, thank God, huh?\n(2081.48, 2083.78)  I am, actually, I am, actually.\n(2083.78, 2086.12)  I'm glad that I am, yeah.\n(2086.12, 2087.68)  It's a miracle when you think of it.\n(2087.68, 2090.0)  I could have really broken something.\n(2090.0, 2091.32)  Really, yeah.\n(2091.32, 2092.92)  Yeah, it caught the aim.\n(2092.92, 2093.86)  Oh, yeah.\n(2093.86, 2095.8)  Boy, I went flying, didn't I?\n(2095.8, 2098.8)  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n",

        "transcript": "(268.0, 288.92)  Good morning, everyone.\n(288.92, 294.72)  In your prayers today, we'd ask you to remember Jack and Edie Linehan for whom this Mass is\n(294.72, 295.9)  offered.\n(295.9, 301.3)  In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, the grace of our Lord\n(301.3, 306.06)  Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with all of\n(306.06, 307.06)  you.\n(307.06, 314.9)  Happy 4th of July to everyone as we celebrate this Mass today, we continue to pray for our\n(314.9, 317.2)  country.\n(317.2, 322.1)  Before we begin, we ask the Lord's forgiveness for those times that we have failed to love\n(322.1, 331.32)  God, or fail to love one another. You were sent to heal the contrite of heart, Lord have\n(331.32, 340.04)  mercy. You came to call sinners, Christ have mercy. You are seated at the right hand of\n(340.04, 347.16)  the Father to intercede for us, Lord have mercy. May almighty God have mercy on us,\n(347.16, 352.3)  Forgive us our sins and bring us to everlasting life.\n(352.3, 357.54)  Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to people of good will.\n(357.54, 362.2)  We praise you, we bless you, we adore you, we glorify you.\n(362.2, 369.84)  We give you thanks for your great glory, Lord God, heavenly King, O God, almighty Father.\n(369.84, 376.84)  Lord Jesus Christ, only begotten Son, Lord God, Lamb of God, Son of the Father, you take\n(376.84, 382.12)  away the sins of the world, have mercy on us. You take away the sins of the world,\n(382.12, 388.08)  receive our prayer. You are seated at the right hand of the Father, have mercy on\n(388.08, 393.8)  us. For you alone are the Holy One, you alone are the Lord, you alone are the\n(393.8, 399.36)  Most High, Jesus Christ, with the Holy Spirit and the glory of God the Father.\n(399.36, 403.72)  Amen. Let us pray.\n(406.84, 423.0)  Father of all nations and ages, we recall the day when our country claimed its place\n(423.0, 426.22)  among the family of nations.\n(426.22, 429.7)  For what has been achieved, we give you thanks.\n(429.7, 433.72)  For the work that still remains, we ask your help.\n(433.72, 440.54)  And as you have called us from the many peoples to be one nation, grant that under your providence\n(440.54, 446.16)  our country may share your blessings with all the peoples of the earth.\n(446.16, 450.92)  Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of\n(450.92, 453.92)  the Holy Spirit, God forever and ever.\n(463.72, 470.48)  A reading from the book of Genesis.\n(470.48, 474.52)  The span of Sarah's life was 127 years.\n(474.52, 481.2)  She died in Kyriathra, that is Hebron, in the land of Canaan, and Abraham performed\n(481.2, 483.96)  the customary mourning rites for her.\n(483.96, 488.48)  Then he left the side of his dead one and addressed the Hittites.\n(488.48, 492.88)  Although I am a resident alien among you, sell me from your holdings a piece of property\n(492.88, 495.96)  for a burial ground, that I may bury my dead wife.\n(497.04, 500.28)  After the transaction, Abraham buried his wife Sarah\n(500.28, 502.74)  in the cave of the field of Machpelah,\n(502.74, 506.32)  facing Memor, that is Hebron, in the land of Canaan.\n(507.6, 509.86)  Abraham had now reached a ripe old age,\n(509.86, 512.58)  and the Lord had blessed him in every way.\n(512.58, 515.32)  Abraham said to the senior servant of his household,\n(515.32, 518.3)  who had charge of all his possessions,\n(518.3, 519.84)  put your hand under my thigh,\n(519.84, 521.9)  and I will make you swear by the Lord,\n(521.9, 524.02)  the God of heaven and the God of earth,\n(524.02, 526.3)  that you will not procure a wife for my son\n(526.3, 529.62)  from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I live,\n(529.62, 532.22)  but that you will go to my own land and to my kindred\n(532.22, 534.16)  to get a wife for my son, Isaac.\n(535.3, 537.3)  The servant asked him,\n(537.3, 540.62)  what if the woman is unwilling to follow me to this land?\n(540.62, 542.5)  Should I then take your son back to the land\n(542.5, 543.8)  from which you migrated?\n(544.78, 547.06)  Never take my son back there for any reason,\n(547.06, 548.3)  Abraham told him.\n(549.14, 550.54)  The Lord, the God of heaven,\n(550.54, 554.24)  who took me from my father's house in the land of my kin,\n(554.24, 557.94)  and who confirmed by oath the promise he then made to me.\n(557.94, 560.14)  I will give this land to your descendants.\n(560.14, 562.7)  He will send his messenger before you,\n(562.7, 565.48)  and you will obtain a wife from my son there.\n(565.48, 567.54)  If the woman is unwilling to follow you,\n(567.54, 569.46)  you will be released from his oath,\n(569.46, 571.54)  but never take my son back there.\"\n(572.78, 574.94)  A long time later, Isaac went to live\n(574.94, 576.98)  in the region of the Negev.\n(576.98, 580.42)  One day toward evening, he went out in the field,\n(580.42, 584.42)  And as he looked around, he noticed the camels were approaching.\n(584.42, 589.7)  Rebecca too was looking about, and when she saw him, she alighted from her camel and asked\n(589.7, 595.74)  the servant, who is the man out there walking through the fields toward us?\n(595.74, 598.6)  That is my master, replied the servant.\n(598.6, 601.46)  Then she covered herself with her veil.\n(601.46, 604.66)  The servant recounted to Isaac all the things he had done.\n(604.66, 606.94)  Then Isaac took Rebecca into his tent.\n(606.94, 610.66)  He married her and thus she became his wife.\n(610.66, 615.42)  In his love for her, Isaac found solace after the death of his mother Sarah.\n(615.42, 617.3)  The word of the Lord.\n(617.3, 620.58)  Thanks be to God.\n(620.58, 622.74)  Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good.\n(622.74, 626.44)  Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good.\n(626.44, 630.66)  Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good, for his mercy endures forever.\n(630.66, 634.26)  Who can tell the mighty deeds of the Lord or proclaim all his praises?\n(634.26, 643.06)  Blessed are they who observe what is right, who do always what is just.\n(643.06, 649.9)  Remember us, O Lord, as you favor your people.\n(649.9, 654.66)  Visit me with your saving help, that I may see the prosperity of your chosen ones.\n(654.66, 681.38)  Rejoice in the joy of your people and glory with your inheritance.\n(681.38, 683.98)  The Lord be with you.\n(683.98, 692.38)  reading from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew as Jesus passed by he saw a\n(692.38, 700.82)  man named Matthew sitting at the custom post he said to him follow me and he got\n(700.82, 706.74)  up and followed him while he was at table in his house many tax collectors\n(706.74, 713.22)  and sinners came and sat with Jesus and his disciples the Pharisees saw this and\n(713.22, 718.78)  said to his disciples why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and\n(718.78, 727.18)  sinners he heard this and said those who are well do not need a physician but the\n(727.18, 735.38)  sick do go and learn the meaning of the words I desire mercy not sacrifice I did\n(735.38, 743.34)  not come to call the righteous, but sinners.\" The Gospel of the Lord.\n(747.34, 753.62)  As we gather to celebrate this Mass on the 4th of July, our hearts are filled, of\n(753.62, 759.54)  course, with gratitude for the blessings of freedoms, the blessings of our country,\n(759.54, 764.94)  and most of all of our faith. On this Independence Day, we give thanks for the\n(764.94, 769.74)  vision of our founders, of course, for the sacrifices of those who fought for our\n(769.74, 775.24)  liberties and for the ongoing efforts of countless Americans who have labored to\n(775.24, 780.78)  build a more just and compassionate nation. We remember that true freedom is\n(780.78, 786.9)  not merely political but spiritual also, the freedom to do what is good, to seek\n(786.9, 794.74)  the truth, to love as Christ loves. Today's gospel is about the call of Matthew and\n(794.74, 801.3)  Matthew was not a popular man. As a tax collector he was seen as a collaborator\n(801.3, 808.66)  of Rome and likely regarded by his neighbors as greedy and corrupt. Yet\n(808.66, 814.06)  Jesus sees in him something more. He looks past the labels, past the sin, and\n(814.06, 824.22)  says two simple words to Matthew. Follow me. This is the Lord we worship, one who\n(824.22, 830.46)  calls the sinner, not to condemn him but to raise him up, to redeem him, and to\n(830.46, 836.62)  draw him into a new life. Jesus didn't wait for Matthew to fix his life first,\n(836.62, 843.88)  he called him as he was. This is good news for Matthew, for us, and yes for our\n(843.88, 850.14)  nation. On a day when we celebrate the birth of our\n(850.14, 856.76)  nation, the gospel challenges us. Are we as individuals and as a people growing\n(856.76, 864.22)  in mercy? Are we becoming more just, more kind, more willing to see the\n(864.22, 872.92)  dignity of the marginalized, the poor, the forgotten? On July 4th 1776 our nation\n(872.92, 879.5)  declared its independence, yes, but as Catholics we know that freedom is not an\n(879.5, 885.34)  end in itself. Freedom is meant for something greater, to serve God and to\n(885.34, 891.08)  serve others. And as Christians in America, we're called to witness to a\n(891.08, 898.26)  higher law, the law of Christ. And that means living out the gospel in the\n(898.26, 905.38)  public square, defending life, caring for the poor, welcoming the stranger, and\n(905.38, 912.26)  standing up for the dignity of every human person. We pray today for our\n(912.26, 918.5)  leaders, for our nation, and for ourselves that we may always hear the voice of\n(918.5, 924.98)  Jesus saying follow me and have the courage to respond. And may we become a\n(924.98, 931.5)  people not only known for our freedoms but for mercy, for justice, and\n(931.5, 942.42)  and for holiness. Let us pray. Let us offer our prayers to God who is the\n(942.42, 947.58)  source of every good gift and we pray for the church that we may always follow\n(947.58, 953.46)  the call of Christ with hearts open to conversion and mercy welcoming sinners\n(953.46, 958.94)  with compassion and proclaiming the gospel and word indeed we pray to the\n(958.94, 966.1)  Lord. For our nation on this Independence Day that we may renew our commitment to\n(966.1, 974.42)  justice, liberty, and the dignity of every human life, we pray to the Lord. For all\n(974.42, 980.14)  who have served or are serving in the armed forces and for first responders\n(980.14, 984.98)  that they may be protected from harm and honored for their service and sacrifice,\n(984.98, 993.48)  we pray to the Lord. For those who feel marginalized, forgotten, or judged like\n(993.48, 998.9)  Matthew the tax collector, that they may experience Christ's merciful invitation\n(998.9, 1006.52)  to healing and communion, we pray to the Lord. For the poor, the immigrant, the\n(1006.52, 1011.16)  unemployed, and the suffering in our land, that our communities and leaders will\n(1011.16, 1017.84)  respond with compassion and justice, we pray to the Lord.\n(1017.84, 1022.84)  For the faithful departed, for Jack and Edie Linehan for whom this Mass is offered and\n(1022.84, 1028.0)  for those who gave their lives for the freedom of our country that they may rest in the peace\n(1028.0, 1033.68)  of Christ and rise in glory, we pray to the Lord.\n(1033.68, 1038.88)  And God of mercy and justice, hear our prayers on this day of our national thanksgiving and\n(1038.88, 1043.84)  help us to build a society rooted in truth, love, and peace. We ask our prayers\n(1043.84, 1047.6)  through Christ our Lord.\n(1068.88, 1085.48)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through your goodness we have received\n(1085.48, 1089.44)  the bread we offer you, fruit of the earth and work of human hands.\n(1089.44, 1094.08)  It will become for us the bread of life.\n(1094.08, 1098.48)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through your goodness we have received\n(1098.48, 1103.22)  the wine we offer you, fruit of the vine, and work of human hands, it will become our\n(1103.22, 1120.38)  spiritual drink.\n(1120.38, 1125.74)  Pray brothers and sisters that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God, the loving\n(1125.74, 1131.46)  from Almighty Father, may the Lord accept the sacrifice at your hands, the praise\n(1131.46, 1135.96)  and glory of his union, for our good and the good of all his holy Church.\n(1135.96, 1141.98)  Except Lord God, these gifts we bring to this altar, and having taught us through\n(1141.98, 1148.5)  the wisdom of the Gospel, lead us to true justice and lasting peace, we ask this\n(1148.5, 1156.94)  through Christ our Lord. The Lord be with you. Lift up your hearts. Let us give\n(1156.94, 1163.5)  thanks to the Lord our God. It is truly right and just, our duty and our\n(1163.5, 1169.22)  salvation always and everywhere to give you thanks, Lord, Holy Father, Almighty and\n(1169.22, 1175.7)  eternal God, through Christ our Lord. He spoke to us a message of peace and\n(1175.7, 1181.46)  taught us to live as brothers and sisters. His message took form in the\n(1181.46, 1186.78)  vision of our founding fathers as they fashioned a nation where we might live\n(1186.78, 1194.9)  as one. His message lives in our midst as our task for today and a promise for\n(1194.9, 1200.42)  tomorrow. And so with hearts full of love we join the Angels today and every day\n(1200.42, 1209.88)  of our lives to sing your glory as we acclaim. Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Hosts, heaven\n(1209.88, 1216.56)  and earth are full of your glory, Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he who comes in\n(1216.56, 1225.24)  the name of the Lord, Hosanna in the highest. You are indeed holy, O Lord, the fount of\n(1225.24, 1230.64)  all holiness make holy therefore these gifts we pray by sending down your\n(1230.64, 1235.64)  spirit upon them like the dewfall so that they may become for us the body and\n(1235.64, 1241.4)  blood of our Lord Jesus Christ at the time he was betrayed and entered\n(1241.4, 1246.86)  willingly into his passion he took bread and giving thanks broke it and gave it\n(1246.86, 1253.12)  to his disciples saying take this all of you and eat of it for this is my body\n(1253.12, 1266.2)  which will be given up for you in a similar way when supper was ended he\n(1266.2, 1270.28)  took the chalice and once more giving thanks he gave it to his disciples\n(1270.28, 1275.84)  saying take this all of you and drink from it for this is the chalice of my\n(1275.84, 1280.0)  blood the blood of the new and eternal covenant which will be poured out for\n(1280.0, 1287.52)  for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Do this in memory of me.\"\n(1293.84, 1300.2)  The mystery of faith. We proclaim your death, O Lord, and profess your\n(1300.2, 1305.92)  resurrection until you come again. Therefore, as we celebrate the memorial\n(1305.92, 1309.68)  of his death and resurrection, we offer you, Lord, the bread of life and the\n(1309.68, 1314.78)  chalice of salvation giving thanks that you have held us worthy to be in your\n(1314.78, 1320.42)  presence and minister to you. Humbly we pray that partaking of the body and\n(1320.42, 1326.06)  blood of Christ we may be gathered into one by the Holy Spirit. Remember Lord\n(1326.06, 1330.58)  your church spread throughout the world and bring her to the fullness of charity\n(1330.58, 1336.74)  together with Leo our Pope and Richard our Bishop and all the clergy. Remember\n(1336.74, 1340.58)  also our brothers and sisters who have fallen asleep in the hope of the\n(1340.58, 1346.26)  resurrection and all who have died in your mercy welcome them into the light\n(1346.26, 1351.92)  of your face and have mercy on us all we pray that with the Blessed Virgin Mary\n(1351.92, 1358.22)  mother of God st. Joseph her spouse with the Blessed Apostles st. Bridget st.\n(1358.22, 1362.78)  Augustine and all the Saints who have pleased you throughout the ages that we\n(1362.78, 1368.34)  He may merit to be co-heirs to eternal life and may praise and glorify you through your\n(1368.34, 1371.52)  Son, Jesus Christ.\n(1371.52, 1376.16)  Through him and with him and in him, O God Almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy\n(1376.16, 1384.64)  Spirit, all glory and honor is yours forever and ever.\n(1384.64, 1389.8)  At the Savior's command and formed by divine teaching, we dare to pray now.\n(1389.8, 1396.48)  Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,\n(1396.48, 1403.22)  on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our\n(1403.22, 1409.78)  trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us, and lead us not into\n(1409.78, 1416.34)  temptation, but deliver us from evil. Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil,\n(1416.34, 1421.46)  graciously grant peace in our days, that by the help of your mercy we may be\n(1421.46, 1426.86)  always free from sin and safe from all distress, as we await the blessed hope in\n(1426.86, 1433.98)  the coming of our Savior Jesus Christ, for the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours, now and forever.\n(1433.98, 1438.9)  Lord Jesus Christ, who said to your apostles peace I leave you, my peace I\n(1438.9, 1444.02)  give you, look not now on our sins but on the faith of your church, and graciously\n(1444.02, 1450.1)  grant her peace and unity in accordance with your will, who live and reign forever and ever.\n(1450.82, 1466.74)  The peace of the Lord be with you always. Let's offer each other some sign of Christ's peace.\n(1474.02, 1482.02)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1482.02, 1487.34)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1487.34, 1495.06)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, grant us peace.\n(1495.06, 1500.34)  Behold the Lamb of God, behold Him who takes away the sins of the world, blessed are those\n(1500.34, 1502.74)  called to the Supper of the Lamb.\n(1502.74, 1506.7)  Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof,\n(1506.7, 1510.18)  but only say the word and my soul shall be healed.\n(1532.74, 1556.74)  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,\n(1556.74, 1561.74)  yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,\n(1708.74, 1736.98)  Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee, blessed art thou among women, and blessed\n(1736.98, 1739.58)  is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.\n(1739.58, 1743.46)  Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners,\n(1743.46, 1746.06)  now and at the hour of our death, amen.\n(1747.74, 1748.74)  Let us pray.\n(1752.02, 1755.42)  May the love we share in this Eucharist, Heavenly Father,\n(1755.42, 1758.76)  flow in rich blessing throughout our land,\n(1758.76, 1763.1)  and by your grace, may we as a nation place our trust in you\n(1763.1, 1767.9)  and seek to do your will through Christ our Lord.\n(1767.9, 1769.3)  The Lord be with you.\n(1770.42, 1773.42)  We bow our heads and pray for God's blessing.\n(1774.54, 1778.66)  May God the Father who has called us to be one human family\n(1778.66, 1782.84)  fill your hearts with deep longing for peace and harmony.\n(1782.84, 1784.2)  Amen.\n(1784.2, 1787.38)  May the Son of God who came to share our life\n(1787.38, 1790.14)  and make us children of the one Father\n(1790.14, 1792.56)  enable you to grow in wisdom and grace\n(1792.56, 1796.4)  before God and the human family, amen.\n(1796.4, 1799.72)  And may the Holy Spirit, who is the bond of love\n(1799.72, 1801.88)  between the Father and the Son,\n(1801.88, 1805.08)  unite in love all here present.\n(1805.08, 1807.56)  May he be the bond of love among you,\n(1807.56, 1811.44)  our nation and all peoples, amen.\n(1811.44, 1813.92)  May the blessing of Almighty God, the Father,\n(1813.92, 1817.08)  the Son and the Holy Spirit descend upon you\n(1817.08, 1818.68)  and remain with you forever.\n(1820.14, 1823.14)  Our mass has ended, we go in peace.\n(1823.14, 1826.14)  Happy 4th of July everybody.\n(1826.14, 1831.14)  Maybe we could sing God Bless America today, alright?\n(1831.14, 1836.14)  God bless America\n(1836.14, 1842.14)  Land that I love\n(1842.14, 1845.14)  Stand beside her\n(1845.14, 1848.14)  And guide her\n(1848.14, 1855.14)  through the night with the light from above.\n(1855.14, 1861.14)  From the mountains to the prairies,\n(1861.14, 1868.14)  to the oceans white with foam,\n(1868.14, 1873.14)  God bless America,\n(1873.14, 1881.14)  My home, sweet home.\n(1881.14, 1887.14)  God bless America.\n(1887.14, 1895.14)  My home, sweet home.\n(1933.14, 1957.1)  Yeah.\n(1957.14, 1963.1)  Yeah.\n(1963.14, 1991.14)  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n",

        "transcript": "(240.0, 255.72)  Good morning, everyone, and happy Fourth of July to all of you.\n(255.72, 260.92)  In your prayers today, we'd ask you to remember Walter and Agnes Logan, for whom this Mass\n(260.92, 262.58)  is offered.\n(262.58, 267.7)  In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, the grace of our Lord\n(267.7, 274.9)  Jesus Christ and the love of God and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with all of you.\n(274.9, 282.72)  Today as we celebrate the forming of our country and the peace and freedoms that we have today,\n(282.72, 287.34)  we ask the Lord's forgiveness for those times that we have failed to love God or failed\n(287.34, 291.88)  to love one another.\n(291.88, 296.96)  You were sent to heal the contrite of heart, Lord have mercy.\n(296.96, 303.2)  came to call sinners Christ have mercy you are seated at the right hand of the\n(303.2, 310.34)  Father to intercede for us Lord have mercy may Almighty God have mercy on us\n(310.34, 316.7)  forgive us our sins and bring us to everlasting life glory to God in the\n(316.7, 322.62)  highest and on earth peace to people of goodwill we praise you we bless you we\n(322.62, 328.32)  adore you, we glorify you, we give you thanks for your great glory, Lord God\n(328.32, 336.0)  Heavenly King, O God Almighty Father. Lord Jesus Christ, only begotten Son, Lord God,\n(336.0, 341.46)  Lamb of God, Son of the Father, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on\n(341.46, 347.46)  us. You take away the sins of the world, have received our prayer. You are seated at\n(347.46, 352.58)  the right hand of the Father, have mercy on us. For you alone are the Holy One, you\n(352.58, 358.58)  You alone are the Lord, you alone are the Most High, Jesus Christ, with the Holy Spirit\n(358.58, 362.24)  in the glory of God the Father, Amen.\n(362.24, 366.78)  Let us pray.\n(366.78, 372.68)  Father of all nations and ages, we recall the day when our country claimed its place\n(372.68, 375.62)  among the family of nations.\n(375.62, 378.88)  For what has been achieved, we give you thanks.\n(378.88, 382.72)  For the work that still remains, we ask your help.\n(382.72, 389.44)  And as you have called us from the many peoples to be one nation, grant that under your providence\n(389.44, 394.96)  our country may share your blessings with all the peoples of the earth.\n(394.96, 399.72)  Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of\n(399.72, 403.22)  of the Holy Spirit, God forever and ever.\n(416.72, 421.68)  A reading from the first letter of St. Paul to Timothy.\n(421.68, 427.84)  Beloved, religion with contentment is a great gain,\n(427.84, 434.74)  we brought nothing into the world, just as we shall not be able to take anything out\n(434.74, 436.66)  of it.\n(436.66, 442.46)  If we have food and clothing, we shall be content with that.\n(442.46, 450.9)  Those who want to be rich are falling into temptation and into a trap and into many foolish\n(450.9, 458.44)  and harmful desires, which plunge them into ruin and destruction.\n(458.44, 467.18)  For the love of money is the root of all evils, and some people in their desire for it have\n(467.18, 474.66)  strayed from the faith and have pierced themselves with many pains.\n(474.66, 480.38)  But you men of God, avoid all this.\n(480.38, 491.86)  Instead, pursue righteousness, devotion, faith, love, patience, and gentleness.\n(491.86, 500.66)  Tell the rich in the present age not to be proud and not to rely on so uncertain a thing\n(500.66, 512.02)  as wealth, but rather on God, who richly provides us with all things for our enjoyment.\n(512.02, 522.3)  Tell them to be good, to be rich in good works, to be generous, ready to share, thus accumulating\n(522.3, 533.26)  as treasure a good foundation for the future so as to win the life that is true life.\"\n(533.26, 542.74)  The word of the Lord.\n(542.74, 546.82)  Give thanks to the Lord for he is good.\n(546.82, 550.0)  Give thanks to the Lord for he is good.\n(550.0, 557.0)  Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good, for his mercy endures forever.\n(557.0, 563.68)  Who can tell the mighty deeds of the Lord or proclaim all his praises?\n(563.68, 567.28)  Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good.\n(567.28, 574.0)  Blessed are they who observe what is right, who do always what is just.\n(574.0, 579.0)  Remember us, O Lord, as you favor your people.\n(579.0, 582.5)  Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good.\n(582.5, 590.12)  Visit me with your saving help that I may see the prosperity of your chosen ones.\n(590.12, 596.58)  Rejoice in the joy of your people and glory with your inheritance.\n(596.58, 599.02)  Give thanks to the Lord, for He is good.\n(609.0, 620.64)  The Lord be with you.\n(620.64, 627.5)  A reading from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew.\n(627.5, 634.02)  As Jesus passed by, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the customs post.\n(634.02, 640.18)  He said to him, Follow me, and he got up and followed him.\n(640.18, 645.92)  While he was at table in his house, many tax collectors and sinners came and sat with Jesus\n(645.92, 648.92)  and his disciples.\n(648.92, 655.42)  The Pharisees saw this and said to his disciples, Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors\n(655.42, 657.86)  and sinners?\n(657.86, 660.06)  He heard this and said,\n(660.06, 663.3)  those who are well do not need a physician,\n(663.3, 664.76)  but the sick do.\n(665.7, 667.8)  Go and learn the meaning of the words,\n(667.8, 671.34)  I desire mercy, not sacrifice.\n(671.34, 675.78)  I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners.\n(675.78, 677.98)  The gospel of the Lord.\n(683.66, 686.46)  And as we gather today to celebrate\n(686.46, 690.7)  the holy sacrifice of the mass on this 4th of July,\n(690.7, 693.58)  our hearts are filled with gratitude, of course,\n(693.58, 696.9)  gratitude for the blessings of freedom,\n(696.9, 699.74)  of country, and most of all,\n(699.74, 704.08)  of the ability to have our faith and practice our faith.\n(705.24, 707.42)  On this Independence Day, we give thanks\n(707.42, 709.78)  for the vision of those four founders,\n(709.78, 712.96)  our founders for the sacrifices of those\n(712.96, 717.66)  who fought in our country and for our liberties,\n(717.66, 721.16)  and for the ongoing efforts of countless Americans\n(721.16, 723.02)  who have labored to build\n(723.02, 725.58)  a more just and compassionate nation.\n(726.48, 730.08)  We remember that true freedom is not merely a political thing\n(730.08, 732.76)  but a spiritual thing also.\n(732.76, 735.12)  The freedom to do what is good,\n(735.12, 738.44)  to seek the truth and to love as Christ loves.\n(739.68, 738.44) \n(743.44, 746.44)  Today's gospel is about the call of Matthew. Matthew was not a popular guy.\n(746.44, 751.44)  As a tax collector, he was seen as a collaborator with Rome,\n(751.44, 757.44)  likely regarded by his neighbors as greedy and corrupt.\n(757.44, 760.44)  Yet Jesus sees something more in Matthew.\n(760.44, 765.44)  He looks past the labels, past the sin, and says two simple words.\n(765.44, 774.2)  follow me. This is the Lord that we worship today, one who calls the sinner\n(774.2, 781.08)  not to condemn him but to raise him up, to redeem him, and to draw him\n(781.08, 788.16)  into a new life. And Jesus didn't wait for Matthew to fix his life first. He\n(788.16, 795.12)  called him as he was. This is good news for Matthew, for us, and even for our\n(795.12, 801.72)  nation. On a day when we celebrate the birth of our nation, this gospel\n(801.72, 808.48)  challenges us, I think. Are we as individuals and as a people growing in\n(808.48, 816.12)  mercy? Are we becoming more just and more kind, more willing to see the dignity of\n(816.12, 824.96)  the marginalized, the poor, the forgotten? On July 4th, 1776, our nation declared\n(824.96, 832.22)  its independence, but as Catholics we know that freedom is not an end to itself.\n(832.22, 839.18)  Freedom is meant for something greater, to serve God and to serve others.\n(839.18, 846.98)  As Christians in America, we're called to witness to a higher law, the law of Christ.\n(846.98, 853.9)  And that means living out the gospel in the public square, defending life, caring for\n(853.9, 863.26)  the poor, welcoming the stranger, and standing up for the dignity of every human person.\n(863.26, 869.1)  Let us pray today for our leaders, for the nation, and for ourselves, that we may always\n(869.1, 876.06)  hear the voice of Jesus saying, follow me, and have the courage to respond.\n(876.06, 882.52)  And may we become a people not only known for our freedoms, but for mercy, for justice,\n(882.52, 892.12)  for holiness. We can pray now. Let us offer our prayers to God who is the\n(892.12, 898.12)  source of every good gift. We pray for the church that we may always follow the\n(898.12, 904.06)  call of Christ with hearts open to conversion and mercy, welcoming sinners\n(904.06, 909.36)  with compassion and proclaiming the gospel in word and deed. We pray to the\n(909.36, 915.68)  the Lord. For our nation on this Independence Day that we may renew our\n(915.68, 920.96)  commitment to justice, liberty, and the dignity of every human life, we pray to\n(920.96, 929.44)  the Lord. For all who have served or are serving in the Armed Forces and for the\n(929.44, 934.48)  first responders in our country, that they may be protected from harm and\n(934.48, 941.52)  honored for their service and sacrifice, we pray to the Lord.\n(941.52, 948.9)  For those who feel marginalized today or forgotten or judged, like Matthew the tax collector,\n(948.9, 954.52)  that they may experience Christ's merciful invitation to healing and communion, we pray\n(954.52, 957.78)  to the Lord.\n(957.78, 963.6)  For the poor, the immigrant, the unemployed, and the suffering in our land, that our communities\n(963.6, 970.6)  and leaders will respond with compassion and justice, we pray to the Lord.\n(971.9, 978.4)  For all the faithful departed, for Walter and Agnes Logan, for whom this Mass is offered,\n(978.4, 983.18)  and for those who gave their lives for the freedom of our country, that they may rest\n(983.18, 989.78)  in the peace of Christ and rise in glory, we pray to the Lord.\n(989.78, 994.78)  of mercy and justice, hear our prayers on this day of National Thanksgiving, and help\n(994.78, 998.7)  us to build a society rooted in truth, love, and peace.\n(998.7, 1001.66)  We ask our prayers through Christ our Lord.\n(1019.78, 1043.58)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through your goodness we have received\n(1043.58, 1048.5)  the bread we offer you, fruit of the earth and work of human hands, it will become for\n(1048.5, 1055.28)  us the bread of life. Blessed are you Lord God of all creation for through\n(1055.28, 1059.66)  your goodness we have received the wine we offer you fruit of the vine and work\n(1059.66, 1064.76)  of human hands it will become our spiritual drink.\n(1078.5, 1085.98)  Pray, brothers and sisters, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God, the Almighty\n(1085.98, 1104.02)  Father, who have molded into one our nation, drawn from the many peoples of many lands.\n(1104.02, 1110.94)  that as the grains of wheat become one bread and the many grapes one cup of wine, so we\n(1110.94, 1119.06)  may before all others be instruments of your peace through Christ our Lord.\n(1119.06, 1122.02)  The Lord be with you.\n(1122.02, 1124.86)  Lift up your hearts.\n(1124.86, 1129.3)  Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.\n(1129.3, 1134.84)  It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, always and everywhere, to give\n(1134.84, 1141.98)  you thanks, Lord, Holy Father, Almighty and Eternal God, through Christ our Lord.\n(1141.98, 1148.44)  He spoke to us a message of peace and taught us to live as brothers and sisters.\n(1148.44, 1155.14)  His message took form in the vision of our founding fathers as they fashioned a nation\n(1155.14, 1158.24)  where we might live as one.\n(1158.24, 1166.16)  His message lives on in our midst as our task for today and a promise for tomorrow.\n(1166.16, 1172.12)  And so with hearts full of love, we join the angels today and every day of our lives to\n(1172.12, 1174.76)  sing your glory as we acclaim.\n(1174.76, 1183.24)  Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts, heaven and earth are full of your glory, Hosanna\n(1183.24, 1184.24)  in the highest.\n(1184.24, 1192.4)  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, Hosanna in the highest.\n(1192.4, 1195.96)  You are indeed holy, O Lord, the fount of all holiness.\n(1195.96, 1201.24)  Make holy, therefore, these gifts, we pray, by sending down Your Spirit upon them like\n(1201.24, 1208.0)  the dewfall, so that they may become for us the Body and Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.\n(1208.0, 1214.04)  At the time He was betrayed and entered willingly into His Passion, He took bread in giving\n(1214.04, 1217.96)  thanks, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying,\n(1217.96, 1220.96)  take this, all of you, and eat of it.\n(1220.96, 1224.72)  For this is my body, which will be given up for you.\n(1224.72, 1235.96)  In a similar way, when supper was ended,\n(1235.96, 1238.68)  he took the chalice, and once more, giving thanks,\n(1238.68, 1242.68)  he gave it to his disciples, saying, take this, all of you,\n(1242.68, 1244.18)  and drink from it.\n(1244.18, 1246.72)  For this is the chalice of my blood,\n(1246.72, 1248.96)  the blood of the new and eternal covenant\n(1248.96, 1251.76)  which will be poured out for you and for many\n(1251.76, 1253.84)  for the forgiveness of sins.\n(1253.84, 1256.3)  Do this in memory of me.\n(1256.3, 1261.3)  The mystery of faith.\n(1267.32, 1269.9)  We proclaim your death, oh Lord,\n(1269.9, 1272.22)  and profess your resurrection\n(1272.22, 1274.38)  until you come again.\n(1274.38, 1276.66)  Therefore, as we celebrate the memorial\n(1276.66, 1278.14)  of his death and resurrection,\n(1278.14, 1280.24)  we offer you, Lord, the bread of life\n(1280.24, 1282.58)  and the chalice of salvation,\n(1282.58, 1285.22)  giving thanks that you have held us worthy\n(1285.22, 1288.5)  to be in your presence and minister to you.\n(1288.5, 1291.14)  Humbly, we pray, that partaking of the body\n(1291.14, 1294.26)  and blood of Christ, we may be gathered into one\n(1294.26, 1296.44)  by the Holy Spirit.\n(1296.44, 1299.66)  Remember, Lord, your church spread throughout the world\n(1299.66, 1302.56)  and bring her to the fullness of charity,\n(1302.56, 1304.72)  together with Leo, our Pope,\n(1304.72, 1308.14)  and Richard, our Bishop, and all the clergy.\n(1308.14, 1310.28)  Remember also our brothers and sisters\n(1310.28, 1313.72)  who have fallen asleep in the hope of the resurrection,\n(1313.72, 1316.44)  and all who have died in your mercy.\n(1316.44, 1319.76)  Welcome them into the light of your face,\n(1319.76, 1322.32)  and have mercy on us all, we pray,\n(1322.32, 1325.48)  that with the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God,\n(1325.48, 1329.0)  Saint Joseph, her spouse, with the blessed apostles,\n(1329.0, 1331.9)  St. Bridget, St. Augustine, and all the saints\n(1331.9, 1334.64)  who have pleased you throughout the ages,\n(1334.64, 1337.98)  that we may merit to be co-heirs to eternal life\n(1337.98, 1339.94)  and may praise and glorify you\n(1339.94, 1342.28)  through your Son, Jesus Christ.\n(1344.54, 1346.94)  Through him and with him and in him,\n(1346.94, 1350.58)  O God, almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\n(1350.58, 1354.82)  all glory and honor is yours forever and ever.\n(1358.54, 1354.82) \n(1364.1, 1368.46)  At the Savior's command, informed by divine teaching, we dare to pray now. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.\n(1368.46, 1373.94)  Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.\n(1373.94, 1380.54)  Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who\n(1380.54, 1385.14)  trespass against us and lead us not into temptation,\n(1385.14, 1387.46)  but deliver us from evil.\n(1387.46, 1390.36)  Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil.\n(1390.36, 1393.14)  Graciously grant peace in our days,\n(1393.14, 1395.3)  that by the help of your mercy,\n(1395.3, 1399.38)  we may be always free from sin and safe from all distress,\n(1399.38, 1400.98)  as we await the blessed hope\n(1400.98, 1404.1)  in the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ.\n(1404.1, 1408.54)  The kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and ever.\n(1408.54, 1411.2)  Lord Jesus Christ, who said to your apostles,\n(1411.2, 1413.96)  peace I leave you, my peace I give you.\n(1413.96, 1417.48)  Look not now on our sins, but on the faith of your church,\n(1417.48, 1420.24)  and graciously grant her peace and unity\n(1420.24, 1421.76)  in accordance with your will,\n(1421.76, 1425.0)  who live and reign forever and ever.\n(1425.0, 1428.5)  The peace of the Lord be with you always.\n(1428.5, 1431.76)  Let's offer each other some sign of Christ's peace.\n(1438.54, 1456.54)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world. Have mercy on us.\n(1456.54, 1461.54)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world. Have mercy on us.\n(1461.54, 1467.54)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, grant us peace.\n(1477.54, 1481.54)  Behold the Lamb of God, behold Him who takes away the sins of the world,\n(1481.54, 1484.54)  blessed are those called to the Supper of the Lamb.\n(1484.54, 1488.54)  Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof,\n(1488.54, 1492.54)  but only say the word and my soul shall be healed.\n(1548.54, 1576.54)  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,\n(1666.54, 1693.5)  Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee, blessed art thou among women, and blessed\n(1693.5, 1696.24)  is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.\n(1696.24, 1702.96)  Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Let us pray.\n(1706.56, 1713.04)  May the love we share in this Eucharist Heavenly Father flow in rich blessing throughout our land\n(1713.76, 1719.84)  and by your grace may we as a nation place our trust in you and seek to do your will\n(1720.56, 1719.84) \n(1728.36, 1733.72)  through Christ our Lord. We bow our heads and pray for God's blessing. May God the Father who has called us to be one human family fill your hearts with deep\n(1733.72, 1741.12)  longing for peace and harmony. Amen.

Amen.\n(408.82, 427.24)  A reading from the book of Exodus.\n(427.24, 432.12)  Moses did exactly as the Lord had commanded him.\n(432.12, 438.64)  On the first day of the first month of the second year, the dwelling was erected.\n(438.64, 442.36)  It was Moses who erected the dwelling.\n(442.36, 450.42)  He placed its pedestals, set up its boards, put in its bars, and set up its columns.\n(450.42, 455.76)  He spread the tent over the dwelling and put the covering on top of the tent as the Lord\n(455.76, 458.64)  had commanded him.\n(458.64, 462.28)  He took the commandments and put them in the ark.\n(462.28, 468.2)  He placed poles alongside the ark and set the propitiatory upon it.\n(468.2, 473.72)  He brought the ark into the dwelling and hung the curtain veil, thus screening off the ark\n(473.72, 478.92)  of the commandments as the Lord had commanded him.\n(478.92, 484.68)  Then the cloud covered the meeting tent, and the glory of the Lord filled the dwelling.\n(484.68, 489.84)  Moses could not enter the meeting tent because the cloud had settled down on it, and the\n(489.84, 493.34)  glory of the Lord filled the dwelling.\n(493.34, 498.54)  When ever the cloud rose from the dwelling, the children of Israel were set out on their\n(498.54, 500.46)  journey.\n(500.46, 504.78)  But if the cloud did not lift, they would not go forward.\n(504.78, 508.42)  Only when it lifted did they go forward.\n(508.42, 514.1)  In the daytime the cloud of the Lord was seen over the dwelling, whereas at night fire was\n(514.1, 521.7)  seen in the cloud by the whole house of Israel in all the stages of their journey.\n(521.7, 528.34)  The word of the Lord.\n(528.34, 536.68)  How lovely is your dwelling place, O Lord mighty God.\n(536.68, 540.02)  My soul yearns and pines for the courts of the Lord.\n(540.02, 548.24)  My heart and my flesh cry out for the living God.\n(548.24, 554.36)  Even the sparrow finds a home and a swallow a nest, in which she puts her young.\n(554.36, 563.12)  Your altars, O Lord of Hosts, my King and my God.\n(563.12, 568.12)  Blessed are they who dwell in your house, continually they praise you.\n(568.12, 577.92)  Blessed are the men whose strength you are, they go from strength to strength.\n(577.92, 582.92)  I had rather one day in your courts than a thousand elsewhere.\n(582.92, 589.92)  I had rather lie at the threshold of the house of my God than dwell in the tents of the wicked.\n(607.92, 636.16)  The Lord be with you, a reading from the Holy Gospel according to Saint Matthew.\n(637.92, 644.46)  Jesus said to his disciples the kingdom of heaven is like a net thrown into the\n(644.46, 652.0)  sea which collects fish of every kind when it is full they haul it ashore and\n(652.0, 660.04)  sit down to put what is good into buckets what is bad they throw away thus\n(660.04, 665.68)  it will be at the end of the age the angels will go out and separate the\n(665.68, 670.6)  wicked from the righteous and throw them into the fiery furnace where there will\n(670.6, 676.76)  be wailing and grinding of teeth. Do you understand these things? Yes, they\n(676.76, 682.8)  answered. And he replied, every scribe who has been instructed in the kingdom of\n(682.8, 687.88)  heaven is like the head of a household who brings from his storeroom both the\n(687.88, 695.24)  old and the new. When Jesus finished these parables, he went away from there.\n(695.24, 699.72)  The Gospel of the Lord.\n(706.04, 714.92)  St. Ignatius of Loyola was a young man like many might be today. He loved being\n(714.92, 720.66)  a soldier in the small kingdom in Spain, modern day Spain he was a part of, and he dreamt\n(720.66, 723.26)  of doing great things in a worldly sense.\n(723.26, 726.86)  He wanted to fight for his kingdom and flirt at court.\n(726.86, 732.14)  He dreamed of lords and ladies and glory in the military.\n(732.14, 739.24)  But when one day a cannonball during some meaningless war between two kingdoms of Spain\n(739.24, 742.46)  took out his leg and he had to be ransomed.\n(742.46, 747.1)  He had nothing to do in his bed of convalescence for weeks on end while they had to break the\n(747.1, 749.52)  bone again and reset it and let it heal.\n(749.52, 754.26)  He had nothing to read but the lives of the saints, and it was through reading the lives\n(754.26, 759.74)  of great saints like Saint Francis of Assisi that he was inspired, once his leg was healed,\n(759.74, 765.22)  to give his life to God, to go consecrate himself to the service of the Lord, and even\n(765.22, 772.22)  to try to find passage all the way to Turkey so that he could try to meet the\n(772.22, 776.6)  Sultan, the Ottoman Empire, and convert him just as Saint Francis of Assisi had.\n(776.6, 781.54)  Now he got as far as Venice, I believe on foot, and nobody would take him. They said\n(781.54, 787.1)  you're crazy, you'll die out there. So he did the next best thing, he went and\n(787.1, 790.9)  studied for the holy priesthood, he figured if he learned enough that maybe\n(790.9, 795.94)  he could find a way to be ordained and serve God as a priest. So he had to go\n(795.94, 799.34)  back to school learning Latin with little school boys that could make fun\n(799.34, 803.66)  of him. But in great humility he submitted to this path due to his past\n(803.66, 808.54)  sins of life and gathered nine friends together that would form the Society of\n(808.54, 816.66)  Jesus which would now be known as the Jesuit order. Numbering 15,000 today by\n(816.66, 823.04)  the time St. Ignatius died around the mid 1550s there were 1,000 Jesuits in the\n(823.04, 828.9)  world. They had 14 provinces and were already in Brazil, Japan, all over Europe\n(828.9, 835.94)  and the like because the great things that were in the heart of St. Ignatius\n(835.94, 840.98)  were now of the Lord and the Lord blessed them because the kingdom of\n(840.98, 847.58)  heaven, Jesus tells us, has a destiny to collect fish of every kind throughout\n(847.58, 851.74)  the world and to have a full haul to bring it ashore if only we his\n(851.74, 856.18)  instruments would desire to do great things and be led by the Holy Spirit in\n(856.18, 862.82)  docility to God's will to do the things which God desires of us. Saint Ignatius\n(862.82, 867.02)  never did make it to the Holy Land and he ended up spending the last I believe\n(867.02, 871.62)  dozen years of his life actually sitting at his desk in Rome just writing letters\n(871.62, 875.9)  directing the activities of Jesuits who were going all over the world as he\n(875.9, 881.18)  desired but that was not God's will and from Rome he was able to organize the\n(881.18, 883.42)  great\n",

Moses did exactly as the Lord had commanded him.\n(391.9, 398.64)  On the first day of the first month of the second year, the dwelling was erected.\n(398.64, 402.24)  It was Moses who erected the dwelling.\n(402.24, 411.0)  He placed its pedestals, set up its boards, put in its bars, and set up its columns.\n(411.0, 417.46)  He spread the tent over the dwelling and put the covering on top of the tent as the Lord\n(417.46, 419.94)  had commanded him.\n(419.94, 423.8)  He took the commandments and put them in the ark.\n(423.8, 430.12)  He placed poles alongside the ark and set the propituary upon it.\n(430.12, 436.24)  He brought the ark into the dwelling and hung the curtain veil, thus screening off the Ark\n(436.24, 441.68)  of the Commandments as the Lord had commanded him.\n(441.68, 448.16)  Then the cloud covered the meeting tent, and the glory of the Lord filled the dwelling.\n(448.16, 454.98)  Moses could not enter the meeting tent because the cloud settled down upon it, and the glory\n(454.98, 458.86)  of the Lord filled the dwelling.\n(458.86, 463.8)  Whenever the cloud rose from the dwelling, the children of Israel would set out on their\n(463.8, 465.58)  journey.\n(465.58, 470.32)  But if the cloud did not lift, they would not go forward.\n(470.32, 473.88)  Only when it lifted would they go forward.\n(473.88, 480.6)  In the daytime, the cloud of the Lord was seen over the dwelling, whereas at night fire\n(480.6, 488.84)  was seen in the cloud by the whole house of Israel in all the stages of their journey.\n(488.84, 492.84)  The word of the Lord.\n(492.84, 501.36)  How lovely is your dwelling place, O Lord mighty God.\n(501.36, 505.42)  My soul yearns and pines for the courts of the Lord.\n(505.42, 513.3)  My heart and my flesh cry out for the living God.\n(513.3, 519.8)  Even the sparrow finds a home and the swallow a nest, in which she puts her young.\n(519.8, 529.14)  Your altars, O Lord of hosts, my King and my God.\n(529.14, 534.26)  Blessed they who dwell in your house, continually they praise you.\n(534.26, 542.94)  Blessed the men whose strength you are, they go from strength to strength.\n(542.94, 547.18)  I had rather one day in your courts than a thousand elsewhere.\n(547.18, 574.78)  I had rather lie at the threshold of the house of my God than dwell in the tents of the wicked.\n(574.78, 576.78)  The Lord be with you.\n(576.78, 579.62)  a reading from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew.\n(581.06, 582.98)  Jesus said to his disciples,\n(582.98, 586.22)  the kingdom of heaven is like a net thrown into the sea,\n(586.22, 588.86)  which collects fish of every kind.\n(588.86, 591.34)  When it is full, they haul it ashore\n(591.34, 594.52)  and sit down to put what is good into buckets.\n(594.52, 597.44)  What is bad may be thrown out,\n(597.44, 600.02)  that which is let at the end of the day.\n(600.02, 602.98)  The angels will go out and separate the wicked\n(602.98, 606.56)  from the righteous and throw them into the fiery furnace,\n(606.56, 610.0)  where there will be wailing and grinding of teeth.\n(610.0, 612.08)  Do you understand all these things?\n(612.08, 614.84)  But he answered, yes, and he replied,\n(614.84, 617.56)  that every scribe who has been introduced\n(617.56, 621.28)  in the kingdom of heaven is like the head of the household\n(621.28, 626.24)  who brings from his strength and storeroom\n(626.24, 628.12)  both the new and the old.\n(628.12, 632.08)  When Jesus finished this parable, he went away from there.\n(632.08, 635.92)  The gospel of the Lord, praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ.\n(636.56, 641.68)  Today, as we celebrate with all the Jesuits, I love it when I'm at Wellesley, particularly\n(641.68, 645.8)  the settlement, the new people coming in, and after Mass, they'll say, oh, it's so nice\n(645.8, 647.12)  to have a Jesuit here.\n(647.12, 652.0)  Oh, I said, I'm not smart enough to be a Jesuit, and one of the parishioners said, sure you're\n(652.0, 653.2)  not because you're too genuine.\n(653.2, 657.96)  I said, oh my God, I was educated by the Jesuits in graduate school.\n(657.96, 664.92)  But today, if you look at the crest of Ignatius Jesuit schools, high schools and colleges,\n(664.92, 668.52)  It's a beautiful round emblem with the Sacred Heart.\n(668.52, 672.14)  And it says, for the greater glory of God.\n(672.14, 673.78)  For the greater glory of God.\n(673.78, 677.02)  St. Ignatius today reminds us that, you know,\n(677.02, 679.64)  we are all on a spiritual journey.\n(679.64, 682.96)  And he says that, you know, to grow in the spiritual life,\n(682.96, 684.78)  and I like this quote because it says,\n(684.78, 686.44)  what do we learn from St. Ignatius?\n(686.44, 688.04)  What would be his message?\n(688.04, 691.24)  And he says so beautifully that, you know,\n(691.24, 693.56)  what do you desire in life?\n(693.56, 695.44)  What is it that you're looking for?\n(695.44, 697.8)  And then think about it, and on retreat,\n(697.8, 699.92)  you probably have a few days to think about it,\n(699.92, 702.44)  and then the person will say, this is what I desire.\n(702.44, 705.48)  He said, well, go away and ask that in prayer.\n(705.48, 707.68)  What is it that God is looking for in you?\n(707.68, 710.8)  And what do you really wanna do about this conflict\n(710.8, 713.08)  you have about making a choice to take your new job\n(713.08, 714.84)  or moving to an assignment?\n(714.84, 717.92)  And then they'll come back after four or five days.\n(717.92, 720.64)  He said, well, what do you desire now?\n(720.64, 723.52)  Let me see, I don't know, so this is the lie.\n(723.52, 727.36)  It comes from the spiritual exercises, the four weeks.\n(727.36, 729.92)  What do you truly desire?\n(729.92, 732.92)  And you start to see, you know what I truly desire\n(732.92, 735.28)  is not to take that assignment,\n(735.28, 737.6)  that I just wish I could do something.\n(737.6, 741.2)  So St. Ignatius, through silence and prayer,\n(741.2, 743.0)  brings us to the message.\n(743.0, 745.96)  I had the opportunity in 2013\n(745.96, 748.24)  to make a 30-day silent retreat.\n(748.24, 751.2)  Can you imagine me at a silent retreat for 30 days?\n(751.2, 753.04)  I like to talk.\n(753.04, 754.64)  but it's a beautiful gift.\n(754.64, 756.82)  It is about what brings you to Christ\n(756.82, 758.84)  and what takes you away from Christ.\n(758.84, 760.68)  And they use beautiful scripture readings\n(760.68, 762.0)  through that 30 days.\n(762.0, 764.24)  It's called the Spiritual Exercises.\n(764.24, 767.68)  But more importantly, St. Ignatius was a person\n(767.68, 769.5)  who sinned and struggled.\n(769.5, 771.8)  I was a soldier and was from Loyola.\n(771.8, 774.68)  I had the opportunity after the retreat\n(774.68, 777.2)  to go to Spain for two weeks.\n(777.2, 781.24)  And we went to all the sites where St. Ignatius grew up\n(781.24, 782.84)  and where he did his ministry.\n(782.84, 786.22)  and then eventually we also went to Rome for two weeks\n(786.22, 788.84)  to follow the foots of Saint Ignatius.\n(788.84, 792.46)  He was so good because he knew the pain of suffering,\n(792.46, 795.58)  of indecision, and he said if you're not getting better,\n(795.58, 796.98)  you're getting worse.\n(796.98, 799.76)  That means you need to go further into healing that grace.\n(799.76, 801.08)  Oh, I'm fine, I'm fine.\n(801.08, 802.3)  I don't see it.\n(802.3, 803.86)  I think you're getting worse.\n(803.86, 804.84)  Who are you gonna bring it to?\n(804.84, 805.9)  Bring it to Christ.\n(805.9, 810.9)  So Ignatius was the founder of so many beautiful schools\n(810.9, 813.14)  and through the Society of Jesus,\n(813.14, 815.62)  goes to be a Boston College BC High.\n(815.62, 820.46)  So today, ask God, what is it in your life that you desire?\n(820.46, 822.1)  And tomorrow, if you come to Mass, say,\n(822.1, 824.58)  oh Lord, I've been thinking of this.\n(824.58, 825.58)  I don't have an answer.\n(825.58, 828.22)  Well, that means go away in silence.\n(828.22, 832.8)  In the silence of your heart, I teach you wisdom.\n(832.8, 834.82)  And that's Saint Ignatius Loyola.\n(834.82, 836.86)  Tomorrow, we have another great saint,\n(836.86, 841.86)  of Gonzaga, Liguori, who's founder of the redemptors.\n(842.86, 845.74)  One last line at a gathering,\n(845.74, 848.86)  I think I might have mentioned this a month ago,\n(848.86, 851.1)  a big fundraiser to the Sisters of Saint Joseph.\n(851.1, 853.26)  There was a Jesuit there and he came over to me\n(853.26, 857.18)  and he said, oh, I see that crest.\n(857.18, 859.5)  That's an Augustinian, are you an Augustinian?\n(859.5, 861.5)  I said, oh no, but I went to Maramak.\n(861.5, 863.98)  He said, what do you think of the new pope?\n(863.98, 866.06)  I said, well, the Jesuits are out\n(866.06, 868.16)  and the Augustinians are in.\n(868.16, 870.16)  He said, no one said that to me yet.\n(870.16, 871.0)  How nice.\n(871.0, 873.28)  Let us now pray this day as we stand.\n(873.28, 874.96)  Let us pray for God's grace\n(874.96, 877.28)  that you have found the better path.\n(877.28, 878.76)  You're here this morning.\n(878.76, 880.44)  What more would St. Ignatius say\n(880.44, 882.36)  than say thank God for being here.\n(882.36, 885.42)  May God use you this day, this week in a special way.\n(885.42, 886.6)  We pray to the Lord.\n(887.72, 890.84)  Let us pray for the sick and the dying, the departed.\n(890.84, 892.68)  We ask the Lord to be with us in our prayer.\n(892.68, 893.98)  We pray to the Lord.\n(894.84, 893.98) \n(898.78, 900.98)  Let us pray for our intention and for all those that we bring to Christ this day. We pray to the Lord.\n(900.98, 907.3)  Let us pray maybe from a religious sister or a Jesuit that maybe involves you in deeper\n(907.3, 910.96)  faith that we might be in another school or through another person.\n(910.96, 916.54)  We pray to the Lord for the summer, for those who travel, for safety and peace, and for\n(916.54, 920.58)  those who are in need of shelter and warmth and caring, for world peace.\n(920.58, 922.98)  We pray to the Lord.\n(922.98, 926.58)  And God, we end, oh Lord, with this beautiful prayer.\n(926.58, 929.56)  Take, Lord, receive all my liberty,\n(929.56, 933.38)  my memory and my understanding and my entire will.\n(933.38, 937.36)  All that I have in possess, you have given all to me.\n(937.36, 939.86)  To your Lord, I return it.\n(939.86, 940.94)  All is yours.\n(940.94, 944.18)  Dispose of it fully according to your will.\n(944.18, 948.06)  Give me your love and your grace, which is enough for me.\n(948.06, 949.66)  That's the prayer of St. Ignatius.\n(949.66, 952.06)  Please be seated now as we prepare for Eucharist.\n(952.98, 980.9)  My mouth gets so dry, I want you to hear me, amen.\n(982.98, 1001.14)  Pray, my brothers and sisters, that this sacrifice may be acceptable to God the Almighty Father.\n(1001.14, 1006.62)  May these offerings we make to you as we celebrate St. Ignatius be pleasing, Lord, to you and\n(1006.62, 1011.78)  grant that by these sacred mysteries which you have made the fruit of all holiness may\n(1011.78, 1024.34)  my friends the Lord be with you lift up your hearts let us give thanks to the\n(1024.34, 1030.1)  Lord our God is truly right in just our duty and our salvation always and\n(1030.1, 1034.54)  everywhere to give you thanks Lord Holy Father almighty eternal God through\n(1034.54, 1040.42)  Christ our Lord for as on the fest as on the festival of St. Ignatius his feast\n(1040.42, 1046.02)  day. You bid your church to rejoice so too to strengthen us by his example of a holy light.\n(1046.74, 1052.5)  Teach her by the words of preaching and keep the church safe in answer to your prayers. And so with\n(1052.5, 1057.78)  all the angels and saints in the company of the saints we sing the glory of your name as we pray\n(1057.78, 1065.78)  without end as we pray holy holy holy lord god of hosts heaven and earth are full of your glory\n(1065.78, 1071.54)  Hosanna in the highest blessed is he who comes in the name of the lord hosanna in the highest\n(1072.5, 1078.66)  let us pray you are indeed holy o lord the fount of all holiness make for these gifts we pray by\n(1078.66, 1083.7)  sending down your spirit upon them like the dewfall that they may become for us the body\n(1083.7, 1091.62)  and blood of our lord and savior jesus christ at the time he was betrayed and entered willingly\n(1091.62, 1097.86)  into his passion he took bread and giving thanks broke it gave it to his disciples saying take\n(1097.86, 1102.58)  this all of you and eat of it but this is my body which will be given up for you\n(1110.74, 1116.98)  in a similar way when supper was ended he took the chalice and once more giving thanks he gave\n(1116.98, 1118.76)  He gave it to his disciples, saying,\n(1118.76, 1120.94)  take this, all of you, and drink from it.\n(1120.94, 1123.14)  For this is the chalice of my blood,\n(1123.14, 1125.5)  the blood of the new and eternal covenant,\n(1125.5, 1128.14)  which will be poured out for you and for many,\n(1128.14, 1130.02)  for the forgiveness of sins.\n(1130.02, 1131.94)  Do this in memory of me.\n(1141.94, 1143.98)  The mystery of faith.\n(1143.98, 1146.56)  When we eat this bread and drink this cup,\n(1146.56, 1150.64)  We proclaim your death, O Lord, until you come again.\n(1150.64, 1155.76)  Therefore, as we celebrate the memorial of his death and resurrection, we offer you,\n(1155.76, 1160.48)  Lord, the bread of life and the chalice of salvation, giving thanks that you have held\n(1160.48, 1165.72)  us worthy to be in your presence and minister to you.\n(1165.72, 1172.44)  Humbly, we pray, that partaking of the body and blood of Christ we may be gathered into\n(1172.44, 1175.08)  one by the Holy Spirit.\n(1175.08, 1177.68)  Remember, Lord, Your Church, spread throughout the world.\n(1177.68, 1179.28)  Bring her to the fullness of charity,\n(1179.28, 1182.36)  together with our Pope Leo, Your Servant,\n(1182.36, 1184.56)  Richard, our Bishop, and all the clergy.\n(1184.56, 1186.8)  Let us remember this day in prayer, Charlene.\n(1186.8, 1188.56)  Oh, Lord, Your Servant, whom You called\n(1188.56, 1190.08)  from this world to Yourself.\n(1190.08, 1192.24)  Grant that Charlene, who was united with Your Son\n(1192.24, 1195.68)  in a death like His, may also be one with Him\n(1195.68, 1197.56)  in His resurrection.\n(1197.56, 1200.96)  Remember also our brothers and sisters\n(1200.96, 1205.4)  who have fallen asleep in the hope of the resurrection,\n(1205.4, 1208.44)  and all who have died in your mercy.\n(1208.44, 1210.92)  Welcome them into the light of your face.\n(1210.92, 1212.88)  Have mercy on us all, we pray,\n(1212.88, 1215.32)  with the blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God,\n(1215.32, 1217.88)  Saint Ignatius of Loyola, all the apostles,\n(1217.88, 1220.84)  and all your saints who pleased you throughout the ages,\n(1220.84, 1223.48)  that we may merit to be coheirs to eternal life,\n(1223.48, 1227.84)  and praise and glorify you through your Son, Jesus Christ.\n(1230.66, 1227.84) \n(1234.94, 1242.5)  Through him, with him in him, O God Almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, all glory and honor is yours, forever and ever, amen.\n(1242.5, 1248.82)  At the Savior's command, informed by divine teaching, we dare to say, Our Father, who\n(1248.82, 1251.9)  art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.\n(1251.9, 1256.7)  Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.\n(1256.7, 1262.5)  Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who\n(1262.5, 1269.22)  trespass against us, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.\n(1269.22, 1274.94)  Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil, graciously grant peace in our days, that by\n(1274.94, 1282.7)  the help of your mercy we may be always free from sin, safe from all distress, as we await\n(1282.7, 1287.54)  of blessed hope in the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ.\n(1287.54, 1293.26)  For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours, now and forever.\n(1293.26, 1300.44)  Lord Jesus Christ, who said to your apostles, Peace I leave you, my peace I give you.\n(1300.44, 1305.5)  Look not on our sins, but on the faith of your church, and graciously grant her peace\n(1305.5, 1311.3)  and unity, accordance with your will, to live and reign forever and ever.\n(1311.3, 1314.8)  On this beautiful day, may the peace of the Lord be with you always.\n(1314.8, 1335.8)  Let's have each other a sign of peace.\n(1335.8, 1340.28)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1340.28, 1343.0)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world.\n(1343.0, 1344.56)  Have mercy on us.\n(1344.56, 1347.48)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world.\n(1347.48, 1349.12)  Grant us peace.\n(1349.12, 1350.36)  Behold the Lamb of God.\n(1350.36, 1352.8)  Behold him who takes away the sins of the world.\n(1352.8, 1355.4)  Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb.\n(1355.4, 1357.96)  Lord, I am not worthy to enter my roof,\n(1357.96, 1360.8)  but only say the word and my soul shall be healed.\n(1360.8, 1362.16)  May the body and blood of Christ\n(1362.16, 1363.88)  bring us all to everlasting life.\n(1370.28, 1378.28)  If there's another Eucharistic minister present, we'd like you to come forward to help us with\n(1378.28, 1381.28)  communion, if possible, with your Eucharistic ministry.\n(1400.28, 1410.28)  God is my shepherd, there is nothing I shall need.\n(1410.28, 1422.28)  O God, you are my shepherd, there is nothing I need.\n(1422.28, 1434.28)  In your bastards of tender green, you came to me reborn.\n(1434.28, 1447.28)  I won a school refreshment, you wakened my soul.\n(1447.28, 1461.28)  You guide me along the right path, You are true to Your name.\n(1462.28, 1474.28)  The Lord is my shepherd, There is nothing I shall need.\n(1474.28, 1486.78)  The Lord is my shepherd, there is nothing I shall need.\n(1486.78, 1498.78)  I walk in darkness valley, but no evil do I fear.\n(1498.78, 1504.78)  You are there with your crook and staff.\n(1504.78, 1510.78)  You call the green with me.\n(1510.78, 1516.78)  A table you set before me.\n(1516.78, 1522.78)  Inside of my fold.\n(1522.78, 1537.78)  I heard you anoint with your oil, and my cup overflowed with me.\n(1537.78, 1550.78)  The Lord is my shepherd, there is nothing I shall need.\n(1550.78, 1563.26)  The Lord is my shepherd, there is nothing I shall need.\n(1563.26, 1575.24)  Your love and Your good pursue me all the days of my life.\n(1575.24, 1590.24)  I'll dwell in the halls of the sun like that worth knowing as I hear.\n(1590.24, 1596.24)  The Lord is my shepherd.\n(1596.24, 1602.24)  There is nothing I shall be.\n(1602.24, 1614.24)  The Lord is my shepherd, there is nothing I shall be.\n(1614.24, 1624.24)  There is nothing I shall be.\n(1632.24, 1651.12)  As we pray today, we must remember not just St. Ignatius, when he was at the University\n(1651.12, 1656.96)  of Paris studying, he needed more education to continue into the priesthood and he met\n(1656.96, 1660.64)  St. Francis Xavier and Peter Spavor.\n(1660.64, 1664.28)  St. Francis is known for the Sacred Heart of Jesus and\n(1664.28, 1668.52)  they take a vow, the Jesuits' poverty, chastity, and obedience,\n(1668.52, 1672.04)  they take a special vow to the Pope.\n(1672.04, 1676.96)  So the Pope asked Ignatius, I would like you to send one of the Jesuits to India.\n(1676.96, 1680.24)  And so Ignatius really wanted to go,\n(1680.24, 1683.84)  but St. Ignatius was the one\n(1683.84, 1687.6)  that was free to go, so he went and did incredible work.\n(1687.6, 1688.8)  Incredible work.\n(1688.8, 1691.48)  He said that some days he couldn't even lift his arm\n(1691.48, 1694.16)  because he had so many baptisms.\n(1694.16, 1697.86)  And he died, and so St. Ignatius was writing him\n(1697.86, 1700.12)  to come home after 12 years.\n(1700.12, 1704.94)  And so it took him two years to get a response.\n(1704.94, 1708.44)  He had died about six months before he got the letter.\n(1708.44, 1710.5)  And so we also think of Peter Faber.\n(1710.5, 1712.92)  When St. Francis became pope,\n(1712.92, 1716.36)  He always felt the three of them should be saints, canonized.\n(1716.36, 1719.28)  And so what did St. Francis do as Pope?\n(1719.28, 1721.96)  He canonized him as saint.\n(1721.96, 1724.16)  So those three wonderful Jesuits.\n(1724.16, 1727.24)  Let us stand now for our final prayer this day.\n(1729.08, 1731.6)  May the sacrifice, we pray, O Lord,\n(1731.6, 1733.68)  that we may be offered with thanksgiving\n(1733.68, 1735.76)  in honor of Saint Ignatius, O Lord,\n(1735.76, 1740.2)  bring us to exalt your majesty without end.\n(1740.2, 1742.8)  For one thing we ask all the days of my life\n(1742.8, 1744.98)  is to dwell in the house of the Lord.\n(1744.98, 1747.9)  And you and I have done that today, so we're blessed.\n(1747.9, 1749.78)  May we use that gift wherever we go.\n(1749.78, 1751.1)  May the Lord bless you and keep you.\n(1751.1, 1753.94)  May His face shine upon you and be gracious to you.\n(1753.94, 1756.18)  May Almighty God bless you in the name of the Father,\n(1756.18, 1758.66)  the Son, and the Holy Spirit, amen.\n(1758.66, 1760.18)  Our celebration has ended.\n(1760.18, 1762.1)  Let us go in the peace of Christ.\n(1762.1, 1763.3)  Thanks be to God.\n(1763.3, 1764.7)  Have a great day.\n(1764.7, 1765.54)  Go.\n",

Lord, have mercy.\n(414.02, 418.02)  Glory to God in the highest,\n(418.02, 422.02)  and on earth peace to people of good will.\n(422.02, 427.02)  We praise you, we bless you,\n(427.02, 432.02)  we adore you, we glorify you,\n(432.02, 442.72)  We give you thanks for your great glory, Lord God, heavenly King,\n(442.72, 457.92)  O God, almighty Father, Lord Jesus Christ, only begotten Son,\n(457.92, 467.12)  Lord God, Lamb of God, Son of the Father,\n(467.12, 474.06)  you take away the sins of the world.\n(474.06, 479.24)  Have mercy on us.\n(479.24, 486.08)  You take away the sins of the world.\n(486.08, 491.26)  Receive our prayer.\n(491.26, 494.76)  You are seated\n(494.76, 500.56)  at the right hand of the Father.\n(500.56, 508.76)  Have mercy on us.\n(508.76, 513.48)  For you alone are the Holy One.\n(513.48, 523.06)  You alone are the Lord.\n(542.08, 523.06) \n(539.94, 540.82)  Jesus Christ with the Holy Spirit, in the glory of God the Father. Amen.\n(541.54, 543.94)  Let us pray.\n(550.1, 557.06)  O God, protector of those who hope in you, without whom nothing has firm foundation, nothing is holy. Bestow in abundance your mercy upon us and grant that with you as our ruler and\n(557.06, 564.58)  guide we may use the good things that pass in such a way as to hold fast even now to those that ever\n(564.58, 570.18)  endure. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the\n(570.18, 577.18)  the Holy Spirit, God forever and ever.\n(581.38, 583.5)  A reading from the book of the Genesis.\n(583.5, 586.5)  In those days, the Lord said,\n(586.5, 589.58)  the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great\n(589.58, 591.46)  and their sin so grave,\n(591.46, 594.82)  that it must go down and see whether or not their actions\n(594.82, 598.56)  fully correspond to the cry against them that comes to me.\n(598.56, 600.84)  I mean to find out.\n(600.84, 604.24)  While Abraham's visitors walked on farther towards Sodom,\n(604.24, 606.8)  the Lord remained standing before Abraham.\n(606.8, 609.16)  Then Abraham drew nearer and said,\n(609.16, 611.86)  will you sweep away the innocent with the guilty?\n(611.86, 615.12)  Suppose there were 50 innocent people in the city.\n(615.12, 617.76)  Would you wipe out the place rather than spare it\n(617.76, 621.1)  for the sake of the 50 innocent people within it?\n(621.1, 623.64)  Far be it from you to do such a thing,\n(623.64, 626.12)  to make the innocent die with the guilty\n(626.12, 627.76)  so that the innocent and the guilty\n(627.76, 630.48)  would be treated alike.\n(630.48, 634.22)  Should not the judge of all the world act with justice?\n(634.22, 637.56)  The Lord replied, if I find 50 innocent people\n(637.56, 639.72)  in the city of Sodom, I will spare\n(639.72, 642.08)  the whole place for their sake.\n(642.08, 644.28)  Abraham spoke up again.\n(644.28, 647.32)  See how I am presuming to speak to my Lord,\n(647.32, 649.88)  though I am but dust and ashes.\n(649.88, 652.8)  What if there are five less than 50 innocent people?\n(652.8, 656.0)  Will you destroy the whole city because of those five?\n(656.0, 661.36)  He answered, I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there.\n(661.36, 666.1)  But Abraham persisted, saying, What if only forty are found there?\n(666.1, 671.04)  He replied, I will forbear doing it for the sake of the forty.\n(671.04, 675.92)  Then Abraham said, Let not my Lord grow impatient if I go on.\n(675.92, 678.16)  What if only thirty are found there?\n(678.16, 682.92)  He replied, I will forbear doing it if I can find but thirty there.\n(682.92, 685.52)  Still, Abraham went on.\n(685.52, 690.62)  Since I have thus dared to speak to my Lord, what if there are no more than twenty?\n(690.62, 695.2)  The Lord answered, I will not destroy it for the sake of the twenty.\n(695.2, 702.54)  But still he persisted, Please, let not my Lord grow angry if I speak up one last time.\n(702.54, 704.58)  What if there are at least ten there?\n(704.58, 710.14)  He replied, For the sake of those ten, I will not destroy it.\n(710.14, 711.14)  The word of the Lord.\n(711.14, 712.14)  Amen.\n(712.14, 713.14)  Amen.\n(713.14, 714.14)  Amen.\n(714.14, 715.14)  Amen.\n(715.14, 716.14)  Amen.\n(716.14, 717.14)  Amen.\n(717.14, 718.14)  Amen.\n(718.14, 719.14)  Amen.\n(719.14, 720.14)  Amen.\n(720.14, 721.14)  Amen.\n(721.14, 722.14)  Amen.\n(722.14, 723.14)  Amen.\n(723.14, 724.14)  Amen.\n(724.14, 725.14)  Amen.\n(725.14, 726.14)  Amen.\n(726.14, 727.14)  Amen.\n(727.14, 728.14)  Amen.\n(728.14, 729.14)  Amen.\n(729.14, 730.14)  Amen.\n(730.14, 731.14)  Amen.\n(731.14, 732.14)  Amen.\n(732.14, 733.14)  Amen.\n(733.14, 734.14)  Amen.\n(734.14, 735.14)  Amen.\n(735.14, 736.14)  Amen.\n(736.14, 737.14)  Amen.\n(737.14, 738.14)  Amen.\n(738.14, 739.14)  Amen.\n(739.14, 757.38)  Lord, on the day I called for help, you answered me.\n(757.38, 764.38)  I will give thanks to you, O Lord, with all my heart,\n(764.38, 768.38)  for you have heard the words of my mouth.\n(768.38, 774.84)  In the presence of the angels, I will sing your praise.\n(774.84, 782.96)  I will worship at your holy temple and give thanks to your name.\n(782.96, 795.32)  Lord, on the day I called for help, you answered me.\n(795.32, 801.14)  of your kindness and your truth, for you have made great\n(801.14, 806.74)  above all things your name and your promise.\n(806.74, 814.18)  When I called, you answered me, you built up strength within me.\n(814.18, 825.18)  Lord, on the day I called for help, you answered me.\n(825.18, 837.58)  The Lord is exalted, yet the lowly he sees And the proud he knows from afar.\n(837.58, 847.14)  Though I walk amid distress, you preserve me Against the anger of my enemies you raise\n(847.14, 849.14)  your hand.\n(849.14, 861.54)  Lord, on the day I called for help, you answered me.\n(861.54, 871.62)  Your right hand saves me, the Lord will complete what he has done for me.\n(871.62, 876.66)  Your kindness, O Lord, endures forever.\n(876.66, 882.3)  forsake not the work of your hands.\n(882.3, 887.94)  Lord, on the day I called for help,\n(887.94, 893.94)  you answered me.\n(906.66, 911.66)  A reading from the letter of Saint Paul to the Colossians.\n(911.66, 917.02)  Brothers and sisters, you were buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised\n(917.02, 922.68)  with him through the faith and the power of God, who raised him from the dead.\n(922.68, 928.34)  Even when you were dead, in transgressions and uncircumcisions of your flesh, he brought\n(928.34, 934.34)  you to life along with him, having forgiven us all our transgressions, obliterating the\n(934.34, 940.42)  bond against us with his legal claims which he opposed to us. He also removed\n(940.42, 946.9)  it from our mists, nailing it to the cross. The word of the Lord.\n(964.34, 978.84)  Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.\n(978.84, 984.8)  You are received a spirit of adoption, through which we cry\n(984.8, 1000.6)  My Abba Father, Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.\n(1000.6, 1002.9)  The Lord be with you.\n(1002.9, 1008.0)  A reading from the Holy Gospel according to Luke.\n(1008.0, 1010.6)  Jesus was praying in a certain place,\n(1010.6, 1012.0)  and when he had finished,\n(1012.0, 1014.0)  one of his disciples said to him,\n(1014.0, 1019.2)  Lord, teach us to pray just as John taught his disciples.\n(1019.2, 1023.5)  He said to them, when you pray, say, Father,\n(1023.5, 1027.2)  hallowed be your name, your kingdom come,\n(1027.2, 1031.8)  give us each day our daily bread, and forgive us our sins,\n(1031.8, 1035.2)  for we ourselves forgive everyone in debt to us,\n(1035.2, 1038.4)  and do not subject us to the final test.\n(1038.4, 1041.9)  And he said to them, supposed one of you has a friend\n(1041.9, 1043.9)  to whom he goes at midnight and says,\n(1043.9, 1046.9)  Friend, lend me three loaves of bread,\n(1046.9, 1049.9)  for a friend of mine has arrived at my house from a journey,\n(1049.9, 1051.9)  and I have nothing to offer him.\n(1051.9, 1053.9)  And he says in reply from within,\n(1053.9, 1056.9)  Do not bother me, the door has already been locked,\n(1056.9, 1059.9)  and my children and I are already in bed.\n(1059.9, 1061.9)  I cannot get up to give you anything.\n(1061.9, 1065.9)  I tell you, if he does not get up to give the visitor the loaves\n(1065.9, 1067.9)  because of their friendship,\n(1067.9, 1069.9)  he will get up to give him whatever he needs\n(1069.9, 1076.42)  because of his persistence. And I tell you, ask and you will receive, seek and\n(1076.42, 1081.62)  you will find, knock and the door will be open to you. For everyone who asks\n(1081.62, 1086.7)  receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks the door will be\n(1086.7, 1091.98)  opened. What father among you would hand his son a snake when he asks for a fish,\n(1091.98, 1097.82)  or hand him a scorpion when he asks for an egg? If you then, who are wicked, know\n(1097.82, 1102.16)  how to give good gifts to your children. How much more will the Father in heaven\n(1102.16, 1108.88)  give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him. The Gospel of the Lord.\n(1113.42, 1118.2)  Two weeks ago after this mass I took a bunch of the altar servers to this\n(1118.2, 1122.92)  trampoline park in Norwood to celebrate the end of the year and as the day was\n(1122.92, 1127.2)  wrapping up there was a group of the servers about four or five of them that\n(1127.2, 1130.06)  that were trying to organize the masses\n(1130.06, 1132.86)  to convince me to allow them to have Mountain Dew\n(1132.86, 1134.76)  before we left.\n(1134.76, 1137.94)  And they were really pushing for this Mountain Dew,\n(1137.94, 1142.22)  but I knew that this would be a very, very bad idea\n(1142.22, 1145.54)  to give about 15 10-year-olds a lot of Mountain Dew\n(1145.54, 1147.14)  before driving back.\n(1147.14, 1149.74)  And so I said, no, you cannot have the Mountain Dew.\n(1150.82, 1155.26)  I share this story with you because this analogy\n(1155.26, 1159.2)  It's very helpful for us to understand\n(1159.2, 1164.28)  prayer, which is the foundation of the spiritual life.\n(1164.28, 1168.36)  And it also brings us to the heart of Jesus's teaching\n(1168.36, 1171.1)  in the gospel today.\n(1171.1, 1176.36)  We've all had the experience of praying for something\n(1176.36, 1179.56)  and getting no answer.\n(1179.56, 1186.06)  We make petitions of all kinds that often go unheard.\n(1186.06, 1188.56)  And so we feel stuck.\n(1188.56, 1191.56)  We think we should either give up,\n(1191.56, 1196.16)  or we can believe another and more dangerous lie,\n(1196.16, 1199.66)  that prayer never works.\n(1199.66, 1203.64)  And so why waste our time?\n(1203.64, 1208.36)  That's exactly why the disciples say to Jesus they followed him.\n(1208.36, 1210.24)  And this burning question in their heart is,\n(1210.24, 1213.08)  Lord, we wanna know how to pray.\n(1214.82, 1216.54)  Will you teach us how to pray?\n(1216.54, 1219.42)  Because the way in which we're praying\n(1219.42, 1221.98)  doesn't seem to work.\n(1221.98, 1225.06)  And then Jesus gives the perfect prayer,\n(1225.06, 1227.14)  which is the Our Father.\n(1227.14, 1229.62)  The words are slightly different in the gospel\n(1229.62, 1230.98)  we heard from Luke today,\n(1230.98, 1234.6)  but it is the same prayer.\n(1234.6, 1237.58)  And so before we talk about those words\n(1237.58, 1240.76)  and how they shape our heart to pray,\n(1240.76, 1242.76)  we have to return to that analogy.\n(1245.04, 1249.32)  I didn't give in to their request for Mountain Dew,\n(1249.32, 1253.76)  not because I'm vindictive or I want it to be cruel,\n(1253.76, 1257.64)  but I knew it would be very harmful and bad for them,\n(1257.64, 1260.1)  more importantly, probably bad for their parents,\n(1260.1, 1262.12)  if they had that Mountain Dew.\n(1264.08, 1266.28)  I could make that decision\n(1266.28, 1270.02)  because I know more about their appetites\n(1270.02, 1273.28)  and their fleeting desires than they do at nine years old.\n(1274.42, 1277.9)  The gap between my knowledge and theirs is significant.\n(1279.66, 1284.66)  The gap between us and God is far larger.\n(1286.46, 1288.3)  So many times when we're praying,\n(1288.3, 1289.96)  we're like these little children,\n(1289.96, 1293.38)  making these requests that in reality\n(1294.5, 1293.38) \n(1296.38, 1302.38)  might not be good for us. That's why when Jesus teaches the disciples to pray,\n(1302.38, 1306.38)  He says the very first word you are to say\n(1306.38, 1310.38)  when you address the Almighty God is Father.\n(1310.38, 1314.38)  Because you see, God is our Father\n(1314.38, 1317.38)  and He knows what's good for us.\n(1317.38, 1320.38)  You cannot be a good parent\n(1320.38, 1327.64)  you give in to every single one of your child's requests because they think they\n(1327.64, 1336.84)  know what's best but more often than not they don't. God is our Father and He\n(1336.84, 1342.92)  provides what we need not always necessarily what we want and so the\n(1342.92, 1346.42)  first words of the Our Father when we say them they're supposed to shape our\n(1346.42, 1352.4)  disposition of prayer we say I belong to a father who keeps his promises and then\n(1352.4, 1359.96)  we also say next that our father is in heaven meaning he's higher and more\n(1359.96, 1365.98)  omnipotent and knowledgeable than me our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy\n(1365.98, 1373.32)  name his name is holy and I should honor it hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come\n(1373.32, 1380.56)  thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. You see the whole first part of\n(1380.56, 1390.0)  the prayer shapes us to see that we're talking to a God who's beyond us. So\n(1390.0, 1395.04)  often we think that prayer is about changing God's mind, which is actually\n(1395.04, 1401.88)  impossible because God can't change. Prayer changes us. Prayer teaches us to\n(1401.88, 1404.84)  to want what God wants.\n(1404.84, 1407.04)  That's why we pray.\n(1407.04, 1408.24)  And just to bring this home,\n(1408.24, 1409.52)  that's why the catechism,\n(1409.52, 1410.84)  if you open the catechism\n(1410.84, 1413.38)  and read the section on prayer,\n(1413.38, 1416.66)  it talks about the Our Father.\n(1416.66, 1419.94)  And it says this is the definition of prayer.\n(1419.94, 1425.06)  Prayer is the elevation of the mind and heart to God,\n(1425.06, 1427.68)  to offer Him praise,\n(1427.68, 1430.02)  and to seek His favors\n(1430.02, 1431.98)  in order to grow in holiness\n(1431.98, 1434.46)  for the sake of His glory.\n(1434.46, 1436.7)  The goal of prayer\n(1436.7, 1438.54)  is to become one with God,\n(1438.54, 1441.36)  to become holy.\n(1441.36, 1444.2)  The next time you sit down to pray,\n(1444.2, 1446.54)  and you think it's not working,\n(1446.54, 1450.9)  or you think God is not hearing you,\n(1450.9, 1453.66)  think about it this way.\n(1453.66, 1460.58)  Maybe this challenge is making me holier.\n(1460.58, 1463.04)  Maybe it's making me more dependent on God\n(1463.04, 1468.44)  because I'm actually talking to Him.\n(1468.44, 1472.48)  God is a Father who keeps His promises.\n(1472.48, 1476.14)  And He never gives us anything we cannot handle.\n(1476.14, 1479.86)  And He wants to hear every single one of your requests,\n(1479.86, 1481.9)  every single one of your petitions,\n(1481.9, 1490.62)  But we should hold them loosely because when we pray, he wants to give us his very life,\n(1490.62, 1496.74)  which is far more magnificent than that small request we may have.\n(1496.74, 1511.5)  Because God knows what we need, even when we don't know how to ask.\n(1511.5, 1517.44)  And so confident that God hears our prayers, we profess our faith.\n(1517.44, 1523.08)  I believe in one God, the Father almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all things visible\n(1523.08, 1524.42)  and invisible.\n(1524.42, 1529.64)  I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, born of the Father before\n(1529.64, 1536.32)  all ages, God from God, light from light, true God from true God, begot not made consubstantial\n(1536.32, 1537.54)  with the Father.\n(1537.54, 1539.3)  Through him all things were made.\n(1539.3, 1544.58)  For us men and for our salvation he came down from heaven, and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate\n(1544.58, 1547.22)  of the Virgin Mary and became man.\n(1547.22, 1551.94)  For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate, he suffered death and was buried,\n(1551.94, 1555.16)  and rose again on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures.\n(1555.16, 1558.98)  He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father.\n(1558.98, 1563.5)  He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead, and his kingdom will have no\n(1563.5, 1564.5)  end.\n(1564.5, 1568.94)  I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father\n(1568.94, 1573.22)  and the Son, who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified, who has\n(1573.22, 1578.78)  spoken through the prophets. I believe in one holy Catholic and apostolic church, I\n(1578.78, 1583.2)  confess one baptism for the forgiveness of sins, and I look forward to the\n(1583.2, 1589.04)  resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come. Amen. Turning towards\n(1589.04, 1592.66)  our Heavenly Father with great confidence, we make our petitions known\n(1592.66, 1601.4)  to him. For the people of God, that we become truly a people of prayer and\n(1601.4, 1605.88)  praise especially as we recall who we are, a people baptized into the Father,\n(1605.88, 1611.52)  the Son, and Holy Spirit, filled with the grace and strength of the God of love and\n(1611.52, 1618.08)  mercy, we pray to the Lord. Lord, hear our prayer. For all who suffer persecution\n(1618.08, 1622.16)  for their faith, that they may experience solidarity\n(1622.16, 1624.2)  from their fellow Christians as to preserve\n(1624.2, 1627.32)  despite their difficulties, we pray to the Lord.\n(1627.32, 1629.24)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1629.24, 1631.56)  For our young people, that they may continue\n(1631.56, 1634.6)  to grow in the wisdom, knowledge, and love of God\n(1634.6, 1636.6)  and be inspired to serve the Lord\n(1636.6, 1639.16)  and their fellow human beings generously,\n(1639.16, 1640.52)  we pray to the Lord.\n(1640.52, 1642.8)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1642.8, 1645.88)  For all who are sick and all those who find it difficult\n(1645.88, 1647.96)  to cope with life's burdens,\n(1647.96, 1651.28)  that they may find comfort by turning to God in prayer,\n(1651.28, 1654.26)  and by the help they receive from those who care for them,\n(1654.26, 1655.64)  we pray to the Lord.\n(1655.64, 1657.86)  The Lord hear our prayer.\n(1657.86, 1659.44)  For our loved ones who have died,\n(1659.44, 1663.68)  especially our parishioners, for whom this Mass is offered,\n(1663.68, 1667.92)  for Thomas Cusack, Ryan Mahoney, Elaine Mercer Rowe,\n(1667.92, 1671.04)  and Robert Manus, for all of our deceased relatives,\n(1671.04, 1672.72)  friends, and parishioners,\n(1672.72, 1674.84)  that they may be granted the fullness and love\n(1674.84, 1678.2)  and happiness in God's kingdom, we pray to the Lord.\n(1678.2, 1680.4)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1680.4, 1683.92)  May the silent prayers in our hearts be lifted up to God,\n(1683.92, 1686.78)  who knows our needs even before we ask.\n(1691.16, 1692.48)  We pray to the Lord.\n(1692.48, 1694.32)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1694.32, 1697.32)  Heavenly Father, we make these prayers with great confidence\n(1697.32, 1699.8)  as we ask them through the intercession of Mary,\n(1699.8, 1701.6)  our morning star in gate of heaven,\n(1701.6, 1704.04)  and we speak them in the name of Jesus, her son,\n(1704.04, 1706.12)  who is Lord forever and ever.\n(1706.12, 1706.96)  Amen.\n(1711.64, 1714.3)  Our offer Tori hymn is number 450,\n(1714.3, 1716.84)  the King of Love my shepherd is number 450.\n(1718.32, 1716.84) \n(1744.84, 1768.84)  The king of love, my shepherd is, whose goodness fails. I know thing lack if I am his, and he is mine forever.\n(1768.84, 1777.84)  Where streams of living water flow,\n(1777.84, 1786.84)  With gentle care he leads me,\n(1786.84, 1795.84)  And where the verdant pastures grow,\n(1795.84, 1806.32)  With heavy food he feeds me.\n(1806.32, 1811.88)  Pray, brothers and sisters, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God, the almighty Father.\n(1819.96, 1811.88) \n(1819.88, 1825.88)  Thank you, Lord, for the sacrifice at which it is and the praise and glory of his name, for our good and the good of all his church. Accept, O Lord, we pray, the offerings which we bring from the abundance of your gifts,\n(1825.88, 1837.88)  that through the powerful working of your grace, these most sacred mysteries may sanctify our present way of life and lead us to eternal gladness through Christ our Lord.\n(1837.88, 1846.96)  The Lord be with you. Lift up your hearts. Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.\n(1846.96, 1852.0)  It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, always and everywhere to\n(1852.0, 1855.88)  give you thanks, Lord Holy Father Almighty and eternal God, through Christ\n(1855.88, 1860.78)  our Lord. For out of compassion for the waywardness that is ours, he humbled\n(1860.78, 1865.32)  himself and was born of the Virgin. By the passion of the cross he freed us\n(1865.32, 1870.64)  from unending death, and by rising from the dead he gave us life eternal. And so\n(1870.64, 1874.92)  with angels and archangels, with thrones and dominions, and with all the hosts and\n(1874.92, 1881.04)  powers of heaven, we sing the hymn of your glory, as without end we acclaim.\n(1884.32, 1881.04) \n(1899.42, 1917.8)  are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest, in the name of the Lord, Hosanna in the highest,\n(1917.8, 1928.8)  Hosanna in the highest, Hosanna in the highest,\n(1928.8, 1931.76)  Son, I mean the highest.\n(1937.64, 1939.68)  You are indeed holy, O Lord,\n(1939.68, 1942.16)  and all you have created rightly gives you praise.\n(1942.16, 1944.88)  For through your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ,\n(1944.88, 1947.44)  by the power and working of the Holy Spirit,\n(1947.44, 1950.08)  you give life to all things and make them holy,\n(1950.08, 1952.88)  and you never cease to gather a people to yourself,\n(1952.88, 1955.58)  so that from the rising of the sun to its setting,\n(1955.58, 1959.02)  a pure sacrifice may be offered to your name.\n(1959.02, 1961.78)  Therefore, O Lord, we humbly implore you,\n(1961.78, 1963.98)  by the same Spirit graciously make holy\n(1963.98, 1966.72)  these gifts we have brought to you for consecration,\n(1966.72, 1969.44)  that they may become the body and blood\n(1969.44, 1972.14)  of your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ,\n(1972.14, 1975.14)  at whose command we celebrate these mysteries.\n(1975.14, 1977.7)  For on the night he was betrayed,\n(1977.7, 1980.9)  he himself took bread, and giving you thanks,\n(1980.9, 1983.5)  he said the blessing, broke the bread,\n(1983.5, 1987.18)  and gave it to his disciples, saying,\n(1987.18, 1991.46)  take this, all of you, and eat of it,\n(1991.46, 1996.46)  for this is my body, which will be given up for you.\n(2001.02, 1996.46) \n(2017.68, 2022.36)  In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took the chalice, and giving you thanks he said the blessing, and gave the chalice to his disciples, saying,\n(2022.36, 2030.7)  take this all of you and drink from it for this is the chalice of my blood the\n(2030.7, 2035.02)  blood of the new and eternal covenant which will be poured out for you and for\n(2035.02, 2042.18)  many for the forgiveness of sins do this in memory of me\n(2052.36, 2057.36)  The mystery of faith.\n(2057.36, 2078.08)  When we eat this bread and drink this cup, we proclaim your death, O Lord, until you\n(2078.08, 2080.0)  come again.\n(2080.0, 2087.26)  Therefore, O Lord, as we celebrate the memorial of the saving passion of your Son, His wonder\n(2087.26, 2090.76)  his resurrection and ascension into heaven, and as we look forward to his\n(2090.76, 2093.96)  second coming, we offer you in thanksgiving this holy and living\n(2093.96, 2098.84)  sacrifice. Look, we pray, upon the oblation of your church, and recognizing the\n(2098.84, 2103.08)  sacrificial victim by whose death the body and blood of your son, and filled\n(2103.08, 2107.9)  with his Holy Spirit, may become one body, one spirit in Christ. May he make of us\n(2107.9, 2111.68)  an eternal offering to you, so that we may obtain an inheritance with your\n(2111.68, 2116.42)  elect, especially with the most blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God, with blessed\n(2116.42, 2122.06)  Joseph her spouse, with your blessed apostles and glorious martyrs, and with all the saints,\n(2122.06, 2126.7)  on whose constant intercession in your presence we rely for unfailing help.\n(2126.7, 2132.02)  May this sacrifice of our reconciliation, we pray, O Lord, advance the peace and salvation\n(2132.02, 2133.4)  of all the world.\n(2133.4, 2137.5)  Be pleased to confirm in faith and charity your pilgrim church on earth, with your servant\n(2137.5, 2142.86)  Leo, our pope, and Richard, our bishop, the order of bishops, all the clergy, and the\n(2142.86, 2145.54)  entire people you have gained for your own.\n(2145.54, 2148.62)  Listen graciously to the prayers of this family,\n(2148.62, 2150.46)  whom you have summoned before you,\n(2150.46, 2152.82)  and your compassionate, merciful Father.\n(2152.82, 2154.68)  Gather to yourself all your children\n(2154.68, 2156.3)  scattered throughout the world.\n(2156.3, 2158.5)  To our departed brothers and sisters,\n(2158.5, 2159.82)  and to all who are pleasing to you\n(2159.82, 2161.78)  at their passing from this life,\n(2161.78, 2163.82)  give kind admittance to your kingdom.\n(2163.82, 2166.98)  There we hope to enjoy forever the fullness of your glory,\n(2166.98, 2168.42)  through Christ our Lord,\n(2168.42, 2171.38)  through whom you bestow on the world all that is good.\n(2174.74, 2171.38) \n(2183.7, 2193.74)  through him and with him and in him oh god almighty father in the unity of the holy spirit all glory and honor is yours forever and ever\n(2193.74, 2211.64)  Amen, Amen, Amen.\n(2211.64, 2218.82)  At the Savior's command and formed by divine teaching, we dare to say, Our Father, who\n(2218.82, 2225.06)  art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth\n(2225.06, 2230.4)  as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our\n(2230.4, 2235.98)  trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us and lead us not into\n(2235.98, 2241.58)  temptation but deliver us from evil deliver us Lord we pray from every evil\n(2241.58, 2245.76)  graciously grant peace in our days that by the help of your mercy we may be\n(2245.76, 2250.28)  be always free from sin and safe from all distress as we await the blessed hope\n(2250.28, 2259.02)  in the coming of our Savior Jesus Christ. Lord Jesus Christ who said to your\n(2259.02, 2263.32)  apostles peace I leave you my peace I give you look not in our sins but on the\n(2263.32, 2267.0)  faith of your church and graciously grant her peace and unity in accordance\n(2267.0, 2271.64)  with your will who live and reign forever and ever. The peace of the Lord be with\n(2271.64, 2274.84)  you always. Let us offer each other the sign of\n(2274.84, 2277.04)  peace.\n(2292.44, 2277.04) \n(2302.28, 2314.28)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us. Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(2314.28, 2328.28)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, grant us peace.\n(2332.28, 2338.64)  Behold the Lamb of God. Behold him who takes away the sins of the world. Blessed\n(2338.64, 2343.68)  are those called to the supper of the Lamb. Lord, I am not worthy that you\n(2343.68, 2350.44)  should enter under my roof, but only say the word and my soul shall be healed.\n(2362.28, 2392.2)  Bless the Lord, O my soul, and never forget all his benefits.\n(2392.2, 2399.2)  Our communion hymn is number 2-1-0, Humbly Lord we worship you, number 2-1-0.\n(2422.2, 2434.44)  Humbly, Lord, we worship you, our eternal King.\n(2434.44, 2443.6)  You who died to give us life, hear us as we sing.\n(2443.6, 2453.6)  Jesus, God and Lord of all, come to us, we pray.\n(2453.6, 2463.6)  Thus united in your love may we live this day.\n(2463.6,

The presider for today's liturgy\n(243.72, 248.9)  will be Father Peter. Please remember in your prayers our parishioners for whom\n(248.9, 254.56)  this mass is offered for Claire O'Rourke whose funeral mass will be celebrated on\n(254.56, 260.24)  Saturday at Gate of Heaven Church at 11 a.m. and for all of our deceased\n(260.24, 266.16)  relatives and friends. We do not pass the collection basket instead we ask that\n(266.16, 267.76)  that you place your weekly offering\n(267.76, 271.12)  into the donation boxes at the doors of the church.\n(271.12, 273.32)  Your weekly offering is very important\n(273.32, 276.66)  to the ministries that we provide at our parishes.\n(276.66, 278.52)  You may also donate online.\n(278.52, 281.16)  Please see today's bulletin for that.\n(281.16, 284.32)  We are very grateful for your weekly support.\n(284.32, 285.72)  Please take the bulletin home\n(285.72, 288.8)  for other important announcements and kindly stand.\n(296.16, 325.96)  God is in His holy place.\n(325.96, 330.1)  who unites those who dwell in his house he himself gives might and strength to\n(330.1, 334.48)  his people in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit the\n(334.48, 339.42)  Lord be with you my brothers and sisters let us acknowledge our sins and so\n(339.42, 345.1)  prepare ourselves to celebrate the sacred mysteries I confess to Almighty\n(345.1, 350.7)  God and to you my brothers and sisters that I have greatly sinned in my\n(350.7, 355.18)  thoughts and in my words and what I have done and what I have failed to do\n(355.18, 360.7)  through my fault, through my fault, through my most grievous fault. Therefore\n(360.7, 365.92)  I ask the Blessed Mary of her Virgin, all the angels and saints, and you my\n(365.92, 371.06)  brothers and sisters, to pray for me to the Lord our God. May Almighty God have\n(371.06, 376.4)  mercy on us, forgive us our sins, and bring us to everlasting life. Lord have\n(376.4, 386.28)  mercy. Christ have mercy. Lord have mercy. Glory to God in the highest and on earth\n(386.28, 392.84)  peace to people of goodwill. We praise you, we bless you, we adore you, we glorify\n(392.84, 399.04)  you, we give you thanks for your great glory. Lord God, heavenly King, O God\n(399.04, 405.72)  Almighty Father, Lord Jesus Christ, only begotten Son, Lord God, Lamb of God,\n(405.72, 411.84)  God, Son of the Father, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us. You\n(411.84, 416.72)  take away the sins of the world, receive our prayer. You are seated at the right\n(416.72, 422.48)  hand of the Father, have mercy on us. For you alone are the Holy One, you alone are\n(422.48, 427.84)  the Lord, you alone are the Most High, Jesus Christ, with the Holy Spirit and\n(427.84, 437.14)  the glory of God the Father. Amen. Let us pray. Oh God, protector of those who hope\n(437.14, 442.62)  in you, without whom nothing has firm foundation, nothing is holy, bestow in\n(442.62, 448.22)  abundance your mercy upon us and grant that with you as our ruler and guide we\n(448.22, 453.78)  may use the good things that pass in such a way as to hold fast even now to\n(453.78, 458.46)  those that ever endure. Through our Lord Jesus Christ your son who lives and\n(458.46, 464.26)  reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit God forever and ever.\n(476.18, 483.62)  A reading from the book of Genesis. In those days the Lord said the cry against\n(483.62, 489.72)  Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sins so grave that I must go down and\n(489.72, 495.02)  see whether or not their actions fully correspond to the cry against them that\n(495.02, 503.28)  comes to me. I mean to find out. While Abraham's visitors walked on farther\n(503.28, 510.24)  towards Sodom, the Lord remained there standing before Abraham. Then Abraham\n(510.24, 517.6)  drew nearer and said will you sweep away the innocent with the guilty suppose\n(517.6, 523.76)  there were 50 innocent people in the city would you wipe out the place rather\n(523.76, 528.44)  than spare it for the sake of the innocent the 50 innocent people within\n(528.44, 535.32)  it far be it from you to do such a thing to make the innocent die with the guilty\n(535.32, 541.02)  so that the innocent and the guilty would be treated alike. Should not the\n(541.02, 549.44)  judge of all the world act with justice? The Lord replied, if I find fifty\n(549.44, 554.76)  innocent people in the city of Sodom I will spare the whole place for their\n(554.76, 563.12)  sake. Abraham spoke up again, see how I am presuming to speak to my Lord though I\n(563.12, 571.16)  am but dust and ashes what if there are five less than 50 innocent people will\n(571.16, 578.0)  you destroy the city because of those five he answered I will not destroy it\n(578.0, 586.3)  if I find 45 there but Abraham persisted saying what if only 40 are found there\n(586.3, 594.16)  he replied I will forbear doing it for the sake of the forty then Abraham said\n(594.16, 601.12)  let not my lord grow impatient if I go on what if only thirty are found there\n(601.12, 609.76)  he replied I will forbear doing it if I can find but thirty there still Abraham\n(609.76, 614.48)  went on since I have thus dared to speak to my lord what if there are no more\n(614.48, 620.7)  than twenty the Lord answered I will not destroy it for the sake of the twenty\n(620.7, 628.46)  but he persisted still please let not my Lord grow angry if I speak up this last\n(628.46, 635.94)  time what if there are at least ten there he replied for the sake of those\n(635.94, 644.14)  ten I will not destroy it the word of the Lord Lord on the day I called for\n(644.14, 653.14)  help, you answered me. I will give thanks to you, O Lord, with all my heart, for you\n(653.14, 657.94)  have heard the words of my mouth. In the presence of the angels I will sing your\n(657.94, 664.94)  praise, I will worship at your holy temple, and give thanks to your name.\n(666.46, 672.26)  Because of your kindness and your truth, for you have made great above all things\n(672.26, 678.02)  things your name and your promise when I called you answered me you built up\n(678.02, 688.34)  strength within me the Lord is exalted yet the lowly he sees and the proud he\n(688.34, 694.54)  knows from afar though I walk amid distress you preserve me against the\n(694.54, 704.02)  anger of my enemies you raise your hand your right hand saves me the Lord will\n(704.02, 710.78)  complete what he has done for me your kindness o Lord endures forever forsake\n(710.78, 721.46)  not the work of your hands a reading from the letter of st. Paul to the\n(721.46, 730.62)  Colossians. Sisters and brothers, you were buried with him in baptism, in which you\n(730.62, 737.38)  were also raised with him through faith in the power of God, who raised him from\n(737.38, 744.82)  the dead. And even when you were dead in transgressions and the uncircumcision\n(744.82, 750.98)  of your flesh, he brought you to life along with him, having forgiven us all\n(750.98, 757.78)  all our transgressions, obliterating the bond against us with its legal claims,\n(757.78, 763.22)  which was opposed to us. He also removed it from our midst,\n(763.22, 768.58)  nailing it to the cross. The word of the Lord.\n(780.98, 794.74)  the Lord be with you a reading from the Holy Gospel according to Luke Jesus was\n(794.74, 798.82)  praying in a certain place and when he had finished one of his disciples said\n(798.82, 804.62)  to him Lord teach us to pray just as John taught his disciples he said to\n(804.62, 811.78)  them when you pray say father hallowed be your name your kingdom come give us\n(811.78, 817.26)  each day our daily bread and forgive us our sins for we ourselves forgive\n(817.26, 823.48)  everyone in debt to us and do not subject us to the final test and he said\n(823.48, 828.18)  to them suppose one of you has a friend to whom he goes at midnight and says\n(828.18, 833.38)  friend lend me three loaves of bread for a friend of mine has arrived at my house\n(833.38, 838.5)  from a journey, and I have nothing to offer him. And he says in reply from within,\n(838.5, 844.18)  Do not bother me. The door has already been locked, and my children and I are already in bed.\n(844.18, 850.74)  I cannot get up to give you anything. I tell you, if he does not get up to give the visitor\n(850.74, 854.98)  the loaves because of their friendship, he will get up to give them whatever he needs\n(854.98, 861.78)  because of his persistence. And I tell you, ask and you will receive, seek and you will find,\n(862.34, 861.78) \n(867.84, 873.72)  knock and the door will be open to you. For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks the door will be opened. What\n(873.72, 878.28)  father among you would hand his son a snake when he asked for a fish, or hand\n(878.28, 883.42)  him a scorpion when he asked for an egg? If you then, who are wicked, know how to\n(883.42, 887.96)  give good gifts to your children, how much more will the Father in heaven give\n(887.96, 890.9)  of the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him.\n(890.9, 892.8)  The gospel of the Lord.\n(892.8, 895.72)  Praise be to the Lord Jesus Christ.\n(899.56, 904.24)  Two weeks ago, we went on our trip with the altar servers\n(904.24, 907.8)  to this trampoline park called Launch in Norwood.\n(907.8, 910.16)  And though Paul was not guilty of this,\n(910.16, 913.32)  there were several of the servers who asked me\n(913.32, 914.92)  when it was time to get the food.\n(914.92, 918.56)  They said, Father, we really want Mountain Dew.\n(918.56, 920.5)  Can we have Mountain Dew?\n(920.5, 925.5)  And I knew that that would be a very, very bad idea\n(925.86, 927.56)  to give them all the Mountain Dew,\n(927.56, 929.16)  especially when we were, you know,\n(929.16, 930.2)  it was the end of a long day\n(930.2, 931.76)  and trying to get everybody in the car.\n(931.76, 934.68)  And so I said, no, you can't have the Mountain Dew.\n(934.68, 938.98)  I share this with you because this little story\n(938.98, 941.8)  sheds light on one of the most important points,\n(941.8, 944.72)  actually the foundation of the spiritual life,\n(944.72, 947.68)  which is prayer, which is prayer.\n(947.68, 952.38)  And it also brings us to the heart of the gospel.\n(952.38, 958.28)  We've all experienced the trial of praying and having\n(958.28, 961.52)  our prayers not be answered.\n(961.52, 966.68)  We make petitions or requests to God all the time,\n(966.68, 969.44)  and they seem to go unanswered.\n(969.44, 972.64)  And so we face the trap, or the challenge,\n(972.64, 977.56)  rather, of giving up or even believing\n(977.56, 984.96)  a lie that prayer doesn't work, that it's just a waste of time.\n(984.96, 987.24)  That's exactly why one of the disciples\n(987.24, 992.6)  says to Jesus, Lord, teach us how to pray.\n(992.6, 995.84)  Because they want to know how to do it.\n(995.84, 999.44)  And so then Jesus gives them the perfect prayer,\n(999.44, 1002.2)  which is the Our Father.\n(1002.2, 1009.28)  We say this prayer all the time with our lips, but we don't say it from our hearts.\n(1009.28, 1016.04)  And so before we look at how to pray the Our Father, first let's unpack that helpful analogy.\n(1016.04, 1018.76)  So back to the Mountain Dew.\n(1018.76, 1027.48)  I didn't give the kids the Mountain Dew, not because I wanted to be vindictive or cruel,\n(1027.48, 1033.94)  But it's because I knew it wouldn't be good for them.\n(1033.94, 1041.54)  Because from experience, I know it's not good to have Mountain Dew for many reasons, but\n(1041.54, 1045.74)  one, especially when you're young and trying to get in the car, it could be nap time, whatever\n(1045.74, 1050.1)  it is, bad to have the Mountain Dew.\n(1050.1, 1058.26)  I have more knowledge than the honest and sincere children who are asking for something.\n(1058.26, 1066.42)  The disparity between us and God's knowledge is far greater than mine and a nine-year-old\n(1066.42, 1075.36)  altar server, because God is all-powerful, God is all-knowing, He's the author of everything.\n(1075.36, 1086.6)  And so, when we pray, our disposition should be that God knows way more than I do.\n(1086.6, 1095.44)  And when we pray, the goal is to conform our lives to His will, not the other way around.\n(1095.44, 1099.56)  And that's why Jesus, when He tells His disciples, here's how you pray.\n(1099.56, 1107.72)  And the first word He says is you address God by saying our Father.\n(1107.72, 1115.06)  Because God is primarily a Father who knows what's good for us, who provides for all of\n(1115.06, 1124.6)  our needs, and sometimes what we want or what we think we want isn't actually good.\n(1124.6, 1130.2)  parent would be truly loving if they just gave in to every one of their\n(1130.2, 1136.98)  child's requests because they know more of what that child needs. So that's the\n(1136.98, 1141.7)  first part of the Our Father. We're saying God you're a father and I trust\n(1141.7, 1146.5)  that you know what's best for me. We also say God you're our Father who are in\n(1146.5, 1153.46)  heaven. You're higher than me. You see everything and your name is holy.\n(1153.46, 1157.06)  Holy, hallowed be Thy name.\n(1157.06, 1162.42)  And we are asking for Your Kingdom to come here on earth.\n(1162.42, 1170.54)  You notice in the perfect prayer, the whole first half, we have not even started to ask\n(1170.54, 1173.26)  for anything.\n(1173.26, 1183.1)  All we've done is acknowledge God's providence, God's love, God's position as our Father.\n(1183.1, 1185.82)  That's how we start to pray.\n(1185.82, 1190.42)  This is why the Catechism of the Catholic Church, which defines prayer after going through\n(1190.42, 1192.26)  the Our Father, says this.\n(1192.26, 1194.14)  Here's what prayer is.\n(1194.14, 1204.42)  It's lifting our mind and heart to God, to offer Him praise, to seek His favors, in order\n(1204.42, 1209.62)  to grow in holiness for His glory.\n(1209.62, 1216.7)  The goal of prayer is to grow in holiness and to glorify God.\n(1216.7, 1222.12)  The next time you're praying for something and it seems to go unanswered, think of it\n(1222.12, 1224.74)  like this.\n(1224.74, 1232.04)  Maybe God is leaving this prayer unanswered because it's actually making me holier.\n(1232.04, 1235.62)  For starters, I'm talking to Him.\n(1235.62, 1241.92)  If I didn't have this burning need or request, maybe I wouldn't be praying right now.\n(1241.92, 1247.14)  And the Lord is working through that.\n(1247.14, 1254.96)  We should always, Jesus rejoices in our requests, we should ask with great fervor and persistence,\n(1254.96, 1259.94)  but we should hold onto those requests loosely.\n(1259.94, 1264.24)  Because we belong to a Father in Heaven who knows what's good for us, and He gives us\n(1264.24, 1269.8)  gifts, meaning his Holy Spirit, that is so much better and beyond our\n(1269.8, 1276.04)  understanding, and that's what he wants to give us when we pray, a relationship\n(1276.04, 1289.36)  with the Living God. And so let us stand and profess our faith. I believe in one\n(1289.36, 1294.12)  God, the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all things visible and\n(1294.12, 1299.04)  and invisible. I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God,\n(1299.04, 1304.76)  born of the Father before all ages, God from God, light from light, true God from\n(1304.76, 1309.12)  true God, begotten not made consubstantial with the Father, through\n(1309.12, 1313.76)  him all things were made. For us men and for our salvation he came down from\n(1313.76, 1318.16)  heaven and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate of the Virgin Mary and became\n(1318.16, 1323.28)  man. For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate, he suffered death and was\n(1323.28, 1327.68)  and rose again on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures. He\n(1327.68, 1331.56)  ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will\n(1331.56, 1335.28)  come again in glory to judge the living and the dead, and his kingdom will have\n(1335.28, 1340.52)  no end. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from\n(1340.52, 1343.92)  the Father and the Son, who with the Father and the Son is adored and\n(1343.92, 1349.0)  glorified, who has spoken through the prophets. I believe in one holy Catholic\n(1349.0, 1353.56)  an apostolic church. I confess one baptism for the forgiveness of sins and\n(1353.56, 1357.4)  I look forward to the resurrection of the dead in the life of the world to\n(1357.4, 1362.38)  come. Amen.

552.1)  Bestow in abundance your mercy upon us, and grant that with you as our ruler and guide\n(552.1, 559.1)  we may use the good things that pass in such a way as to hold fast even now to those that\n(559.1, 561.7)  endure forever.\n(561.7, 566.98)  So our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy\n(566.98, 569.98)  Spirit, God forever and ever.\n(575.1, 583.9)  A reading from the book of Genesis.\n(583.9, 591.48)  In those days, the Lord said, the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great, and their\n(591.48, 599.8)  sin so grave, that I must go down and see whether or not their actions fully correspond\n(599.8, 603.9)  to the cry against them that comes to me.\n(603.9, 606.86)  I mean to find out.\n(606.86, 612.66)  While Abraham's visitors walked on farther towards Sodom, the Lord remained standing\n(612.66, 615.26)  before Abraham.\n(615.26, 624.14)  Then Abraham drew nearer and said, Will you sweep away the innocent with the guilty?\n(624.14, 627.86)  Suppose there were fifty innocent people in the city.\n(627.86, 633.46)  Would you wipe out the place rather than spare it for the sake of the fifty innocent people\n(633.46, 642.1)  within it, far be it from you to do such a thing, to make the innocent die with the guilty,\n(642.1, 646.42)  so that the innocent and the guilty would be treated alike.\n(646.42, 651.14)  Should not the judge of all the world act with justice?\n(651.14, 658.08)  The Lord replied, If I find fifty innocent people in the city of Sodom, I will spare\n(658.08, 661.04)  the whole place for their sake.\n(661.04, 663.92)  Abraham spoke up again.\n(663.92, 668.72)  So how am I presuming to speak to my lord,\n(668.72, 671.56)  though I am but dust and ashes?\n(671.56, 676.24)  What if there are less than 50 innocent people?\n(676.24, 679.96)  Will you destroy the whole city because of those five?\n(679.96, 686.44)  He answered, I will not destroy it if I find 45 there.\n(686.44, 690.8)  But Abraham persisted, saying, What if only forty are found\n(690.8, 691.7)  there?\n(691.7, 696.88)  He replied, I will forbear doing it for the sake of the forty.\n(696.88, 702.84)  Then Abraham said, Let not my lord grow impatient if I go on.\n(702.84, 705.56)  What if only thirty are found there?\n(705.56, 710.52)  He replied, I will forbear doing it if I can find but thirty\n(710.52, 711.72)  there.\n(711.72, 714.32)  Still Abraham went on.\n(714.32, 717.5)  Since I have thus dared to speak to my lord,\n(717.5, 720.2)  what if there are no more than 20?\n(720.2, 723.4)  The lord answered, I will not destroy it\n(723.4, 725.48)  for the sake of the 20.\n(725.48, 730.38)  But he still persisted, please let not my lord grow angry\n(730.38, 733.36)  if I speak up this last time.\n(733.36, 736.08)  What if there are at least 10 there?\n(736.08, 741.08)  He replied, for the sake of those 10, I will not destroy it.\n(741.92, 743.08)  The word of the lord.\n(744.32, 766.18)  Lord, on the day I called for help You answered my prayer\n(766.18, 773.18)  Lord, on the day I called for help You answered my prayer\n(773.18, 790.38)  Lord, on the day I called for help, you answered me.\n(790.38, 797.38)  I will give thanks to you, O Lord, with all my heart,\n(797.38, 802.66)  for you have heard the words of my mouth.\n(802.66, 808.06)  In the presence of the angels I will sing your praise.\n(808.06, 816.06)  I will worship at your holy temple and give thanks to your name.\n(816.06, 828.26)  Lord, on the day I called for help, you answered me.\n(828.26, 835.86)  Because of your kindness and your truth For you have made great above all things\n(835.86, 844.34)  Your name and your promise When I called you answered me\n(844.34, 855.78)  You built up strength within me Lord, on the day I called for help\n(855.78, 867.78)  You answered me The Lord is exalted, yet the lowly he sees\n(867.78, 878.98)  And the proud he knows from afar Though I walk amid distress, you preserve me\n(878.98, 885.54)  Against the anger of my enemies, you raise your hand\n(885.54, 898.02)  O Lord, on the day I called for help, you answered me.\n(898.02, 902.02)  Your right hand saves me.\n(902.02, 907.46)  The Lord will complete what he has done for me.\n(907.46, 912.66)  Your kindness, O Lord, endures forever.\n(912.66, 918.54)  forsake not the work of your hands.\n(918.54, 924.78)  Lord, on the day I called for help,\n(924.78, 930.78)  you answered me.\n(942.66, 949.66)  A reading from the letter of St. Paul to the Colossians.\n(949.66, 957.02)  Brothers and sisters, you were buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised\n(957.02, 964.1)  with him through faith in the power of God, who raised him from the dead.\n(964.1, 970.7)  And even when you were dead in transgressions and the uncircumcision of your flesh, he brought\n(970.7, 978.58)  you to life along with him, having forgiven us all our transgressions, obliterating the\n(978.58, 985.34)  bond against us with its legal claims which was opposed to us.\n(985.34, 990.82)  He also removed it from our midst, nailing it to the cross.\n(990.82, 991.74)  The word of the Lord.\n(1000.7, 1026.36)  Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.\n(1026.36, 1047.36)  You are received a spirit of adaption, through which we cry Abba Father, Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.\n(1049.36, 1051.36)  The Lord be with you.\n(1052.36, 1055.36)  A reading from the Holy Gospel according to Luke.\n(1056.36, 1062.36)  Jesus was praying in a certain place and when he had finished one of his\n(1062.36, 1069.36)  disciples said to him, Lord teach us to pray just as John taught his disciples.\n(1069.36, 1078.16)  He said to them, when you pray say, Father hallowed be your name, your kingdom come.\n(1078.16, 1084.36)  Give us each day our daily bread and forgive us our sins for we ourselves\n(1084.36, 1088.56)  ourselves forgive everyone in debt to us,\n(1088.56, 1091.62)  and do not subject us to the final test.\n(1093.76, 1097.64)  And he said to them, suppose one of you had a friend\n(1097.64, 1100.76)  to whom he goes at midnight and says,\n(1100.76, 1105.1)  friend, lend me three loaves of bread,\n(1105.1, 1108.4)  for a friend of mine has arrived at my house from a journey\n(1108.4, 1110.14)  and I have nothing to offer him.\n(1111.08, 1111.06) \n(1114.34, 1116.3)  And he says in reply from within, do not bother me.\n(1116.3, 1118.54)  The door has already been locked\n(1118.54, 1122.18)  and my children and I are already in bed.\n(1122.18, 1125.02)  I cannot get up to give you anything.\n(1126.98, 1130.14)  I tell you, if he does not get up\n(1130.14, 1133.78)  and give the visitor the loans because of their friendship,\n(1133.78, 1136.86)  he will get up to give him whatever he needs\n(1136.86, 1138.74)  because of his persistence.\n(1139.62, 1138.74) \n(1147.58, 1153.5)  and I tell you ask and you will receive seek and you will find knock and the door will be opened for everyone who asks receives and the one who seeks\n(1153.5, 1160.54)  finds and to and to the one who knocks the door will be opened what father\n(1160.54, 1166.42)  among you would hand his son a snake when he asked for a fish or hand him a\n(1166.42, 1173.14)  scorpion when he asked for an egg if you then who are wicked know how to give\n(1173.14, 1179.06)  good gifts to your children how much more will the Father in heaven give the\n(1179.06, 1194.52)  Holy Spirit to those who ask him the gospel of the Lord my friends you have\n(1194.52, 1199.48)  to admire Abraham in the first reading today. You have to admire the boldness,\n(1199.48, 1205.76)  the conviction, the persistence that he displayed in interceding with God. If we\n(1205.76, 1210.6)  all approached prayer with such enthusiasm and perseverance, the moral\n(1210.6, 1215.92)  world might well be a very different place. And as you know, Abraham's prayer\n(1215.92, 1223.52)  was heard. The Lord spared his people. Did you ever bargain with God like that?\n(1223.52, 1232.28)  did you ever say if I will you I have I must say I think God laughs God God\n(1232.28, 1239.84)  hears the prayer but he probably says I have better plans in store anyway last\n(1239.84, 1244.84)  Sunday we heard another story about Abraham and his wife Sarah if you\n(1244.84, 1250.16)  remember they welcomed a stranger to their house gave him food and drink and\n(1250.16, 1256.52)  then they were told that Sarah would bear a son in her old age. It's very\n(1256.52, 1262.84)  clear that there was a deep friendship between Abraham and Sarah and the Lord\n(1262.84, 1270.08)  God and that's why they could do extraordinary things. Imagine that the\n(1270.08, 1275.88)  Lord God asked Abraham and Sarah to leave the comfort of their home in Ur\n(1275.88, 1280.72)  of the Chaldeans, and to make the journey to the Promised Land, which was\n(1280.72, 1285.48)  subsequently the Promised Land. It might not have seen much of a promise as they\n(1285.48, 1290.56)  made the journey. And then they're promised that their ancestors would be\n(1290.56, 1298.12)  as many as the stars of heaven, and at that stage Sarah was barren. And then Isaac\n(1298.12, 1305.76)  arrived. What did God subsequently ask? That Abraham might consider sacrificing\n(1305.76, 1317.2)  him. Abraham and Sarah and the Lord God had a deep friendship that went beyond the obvious\n(1318.08, 1324.96)  and that allowed Abraham and Sarah to respond more fully than they otherwise might have been\n(1324.96, 1334.88)  able to do. The Gospel speaks of a man whose friend calls at midnight. He is nothing to give\n(1334.88, 1343.36)  me to eat so he calls next door now the guy next door is happily in bed all snuggled up okay and\n(1343.36, 1352.24)  when he knocks on the door looking for food he says get that get lost i'm gone to bed i couldn't\n(1352.24, 1361.36)  be bothered and the guy keeps knocking on the door and we're told if he didn't do it for friendship\n(1361.92, 1361.36) \n(1367.6, 1374.88)  that word again. If he didn't do it for friendship's sake, at least he would do it for the because of the perseverance of the man who kept knocking. Now we hear\n(1374.88, 1381.56)  that parable, that story, very often and I'm convinced we misinterpret it. We\n(1381.56, 1389.44)  often think that God is the guy upstairs fast asleep in his room and that we are\n(1389.44, 1398.08)  the ones downstairs knocking on the door. Not at all. God is not upstairs sleeping\n(1398.08, 1406.56)  and telling us to get over it. God is always present to our need. God is always\n(1406.56, 1414.76)  supporting us, walking with us, and trying to help us see the way. In that parable\n(1414.76, 1422.6)  it's God who is knocking on the door it's God who is asking each one of us to\n(1422.6, 1431.8)  open our heart to allow God in and to know God's will in our lives many of you\n(1431.8, 1435.6)  are aware I'm sure of the of the famous painting called the light of the world\n(1435.6, 1440.36)  by a man called Holman Hunt you might know the name but you've seen the\n(1440.36, 1445.36)  picture, it depicts Jesus about to knock on the door.\n(1445.88, 1449.24)  But then you notice that there is no handle,\n(1449.24, 1452.12)  no knob on the outside.\n(1452.12, 1456.96)  The knob and the handle are on the inside where we are.\n(1458.4, 1463.4)  Open it, open it, let me in, it says.\n(1465.68, 1469.26)  Now the great Christian writer C.S. Lewis\n(1469.26, 1473.24)  describes his own experience in this way.\n(1473.24, 1478.2)  He says, go to God when your need is desperate,\n(1478.2, 1481.8)  when all other help is vain.\n(1481.8, 1483.04)  And what do you find?\n(1484.12, 1487.36)  A door slammed in your face,\n(1487.36, 1492.04)  and the sound of bolting and double bolting on the inside.\n(1493.16, 1495.84)  And after that, silence.\n(1497.8, 1495.84) \n(1500.84, 1504.0)  Many believers come to God and they ask God's help.\n(1509.0, 1509.2)  And when they don't get the answer that they asked for,\n(1512.1, 1515.8)  the answer that they expected, they turn away and give up on the God\n(1515.8, 1519.12)  who they believe has given up on them.\n(1520.9, 1525.68)  But C.S. Lewis's response was very different.\n(1525.68, 1530.68)  He says, this is not the moment to go away.\n(1531.92, 1535.96)  This is the moment to go deeper.\n(1536.88, 1541.88)  Because our God is calling us to something deeper,\n(1542.28, 1546.4)  something more profound, something we hadn't expected,\n(1546.4, 1549.66)  perhaps even something we didn't want.\n(1550.76, 1554.04)  But that's where God calls us to be.\n(1554.04, 1556.68)  That's where God wants us to be\n(1556.68, 1559.18)  and that's where God supports us.\n(1560.04, 1565.04)  Again, just think of Abraham and Sarah\n(1565.04, 1567.4)  and the extraordinary journey\n(1567.4, 1570.36)  that their friendship with God brought them on.\n(1571.48, 1576.48)  They never, ever, ever expected it would unfold that way.\n(1578.36, 1582.72)  But goodness, what a great grace, what a great mercy,\n(1582.72, 1584.44)  What a great gift it was.\n(1586.44, 1590.7)  Friendship with God helps us, if you like,\n(1590.7, 1594.32)  friendship with anybody helps us to understand\n(1594.32, 1598.36)  and know more clearly, and particularly with God,\n(1598.36, 1601.06)  who calls us into a deeper relationship.\n(1602.12, 1606.4)  The gospel this evening ends, or this afternoon,\n(1606.4, 1609.24)  ends with an extraordinary, I preached yesterday evening\n(1609.24, 1611.44)  at half past four, I think I'm still there,\n(1612.58, 1611.44) \n(1615.28, 1618.3)  The congregation probably thinks so, too. But it finishes with these beautiful words.\n(1620.76, 1624.44)  If you who are wicked know how to give good gifts\n(1624.44, 1629.44)  to your children, how much more will the Father in Heaven\n(1629.44, 1633.54)  give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?\n(1635.32, 1639.66)  The greatest gift that we can receive from God\n(1639.66, 1641.9)  is God's Holy Spirit.\n(1641.9, 1642.9)  Why?\n(1642.9, 1645.98)  Because that is God's own life,\n(1645.98, 1649.98)  God's own person dwelling within us.\n(1649.98, 1652.98)  And while there are other intermediate things\n(1652.98, 1657.3)  that we might ask for, or that we might desire,\n(1657.3, 1659.58)  or that we might think will be the answer\n(1659.58, 1663.66)  to all our problems, the Lord God,\n(1663.66, 1666.58)  in the Gospel this evening, reminds us\n(1666.58, 1670.26)  that the greatest gift that we receive\n(1670.26, 1673.42)  is God's own life, God's own spirit.\n(1674.3, 1677.7)  And then, no matter what comes,\n(1677.7, 1681.34)  no matter what appears to assail us,\n(1681.34, 1684.56)  the life of God will strengthen us.\n(1684.56, 1687.3)  The life of God will see you through.\n(1689.34, 1692.08)  Ask and you will receive.\n(1692.08, 1694.86)  Seek and you will find.\n(1694.86, 1704.3)  knock and the door will be opened to you of that there is no doubt god's words spoken to us\n(1705.74, 1712.22)  what we receive perhaps lies in god's own mystery but believe\n(1712.78, 1718.06)  it's god's life it's god's truth it's god's way for each of us\n(1724.7, 1718.06) \n(1744.7, 1750.52)  Together, we profess the Apostles' Creed. I believe in God the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth, and in Jesus Christ his\n(1750.52, 1756.82)  only Son our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered\n(1756.82, 1761.04)  under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried.\n(1761.04, 1762.78)  He descended into hell.\n(1762.78, 1765.82)  On the third day he rose again from the dead.\n(1765.82, 1771.14)  He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.\n(1771.14, 1774.46)  From there he will come to judge the living and the dead.\n(1774.46, 1780.12)  I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church, the Communion of Saints, the forgiveness\n(1780.12, 1788.54)  of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting, amen.\n(1788.54, 1795.06)  Jesus said, Ask and you shall receive, seek and you will find, knock and the door will\n(1795.06, 1796.62)  be opened.\n(1796.62, 1800.7)  With confidence in these words, we make our petitions today.\n(1800.7, 1809.02)  For the people of God, that we may become truly a people of prayer and praise, especially\n(1809.02, 1817.82)  as we recall who we are, a people baptized into the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, filled\n(1817.82, 1823.5)  with the grace and strength of the God of love and mercy, we pray to the Lord.\n(1823.5, 1825.18)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1825.18, 1832.1)  For all who suffer persecution for their faith, that they may experience solidarity from their\n(1832.1, 1838.7)  fellow Christians, so as to persevere despite their difficulties, we pray to the Lord.\n(1838.7, 1840.9)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1840.9, 1846.74)  For our young people, that they may continue to grow in the wisdom, knowledge, and love\n(1846.74, 1853.62)  of God, and be inspired to serve the Lord and their fellow human beings generously,\n(1853.62, 1861.5)  we pray to the Lord, for all who are sick and all those who find it difficult to cope\n(1861.5, 1868.22)  with life's burdens, that they may find comfort by turning to God in prayer and by the help\n(1868.22, 1875.94)  they receive from those who care for them, we pray to the Lord, for our loved ones who\n(1875.94, 1884.38)  have died, especially Ann M. Lynch, for whom this Mass is offered, for Thomas Kuthak, Ryan\n(1884.38, 1893.38)  Mahoney, Eileen Merciero, Robert Manus, and for all of our deceased relatives, friends\n(1893.38, 1899.58)  and parishioners, that they may be granted the fullness of love and happiness in God's\n(1899.58, 1904.38)  kingdom, we pray to the Lord.\n(1904.38, 1911.38)  May the silent prayers in our hearts be lifted up to God, who knows our needs even before we ask.\n(1919.38, 1920.38)  We pray to the Lord.\n(1920.38, 1923.38)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1923.38, 1931.38)  Almighty and loving God, wisdom has taught us that prayer is the greatest source of power on earth.\n(1931.38, 1940.98)  So it is with this trust that we make our request to you through Christ our Lord.\n(1940.98, 1943.94)  Our offertory hymn is number four five zero.\n(1943.94, 1947.94)  The king of love, my shepherd, is number four five zero.\n(1947.94, 1972.22)  The king of love, my shepherd is Whose goodness fails me now\n(1972.22, 1997.98)  Whose goodness fails me never, I nothing lack, if I am his, and he is mine forever.\n(1997.98, 2006.62)  Where streams of living water flow,\n(2006.62, 2014.94)  With gentle care he leads me,\n(2014.94, 2023.34)  And where the verdant pastures grow,\n(2023.34, 2033.34)  With happy food, he feeds me.\n(2035.34, 2043.34)  Pray, my sisters and brothers, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God the Almighty Father.\n(2051.34, 2043.34) \n(2058.3, 2059.1)  O God, who in the one perfect sacrifice brought to completion varied offerings of the law,\n(2065.1, 2071.42)  accept, we pray, the sacrifice from your faithful servants, and make it holy as you bless the gifts of Abel, so that what each has offered to the honor of your majesty may benefit the salvation\n(2071.42, 2078.14)  of all through Christ our Lord. The Lord be with you. Lift up your hearts.\n(2079.42, 2085.98)  Let us give thanks to the Lord our God. It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,\n(2086.54, 2092.14)  always and everywhere to give you thanks, Lord, Holy Father, Almighty and Eternal God.\n(2093.34, 2100.3)  For in you we live and move and have our being, and while in this body we not only experience\n(2100.3, 2107.34)  the daily effects of your care but even now possess the pledge of life eternal for having\n(2107.34, 2113.74)  received the first fruits of the spirit through whom you raised up Jesus from the dead we hope\n(2113.74, 2120.54)  for an everlasting share in the paschal mystery and so with all the angels we praise you as in\n(2120.54, 2123.46)  and joyful celebration, we acclaim.\n(2128.18, 2131.68)  Oh, the holy, holy, Lord God of hosts.\n(2137.6, 2141.02)  Heaven and earth are full of your glory.\n(2146.48, 2148.4)  Hosanna in the highest.\n(2150.54, 2157.54)  Hosanna in the highest, hosanna in the highest.\n(2157.54, 2165.54)  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.\n(2165.54, 2176.54)  Hosanna in the highest, hosanna in the highest.\n(2180.54, 2186.82)  You are indeed holy, O Lord, the fount of all holiness.\n(2186.82, 2191.74)  Make holy, therefore, these gifts, we pray, by sending down your Spirit upon them like\n(2191.74, 2200.78)  the dewfall, so that they may become for us the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.\n(2200.78, 2208.06)  At the time he was betrayed and entered willingly into his passion, he took bread and giving\n(2208.06, 2216.62)  thanks, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, Take this all of you, and eat of it,\n(2216.62, 2229.7)  for this is my body, which will be given up for you.\n(2229.7, 2234.86)  In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took the chalice, and once more, giving thanks,\n(2234.86, 2242.06)  he gave it to his disciples saying take this all of you and drink from it for\n(2242.06, 2246.7)  this is the chalice of my blood the blood of the new and eternal covenant\n(2246.7, 2253.58)  which will be poured out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins do this\n(2253.58, 2257.18)  in memory of me\n(2264.86, 2268.86)  the mystery of faith.\n(2272.86, 2276.86)  When we eat this bread\n(2276.86, 2280.86)  and drink this cup,\n(2280.86, 2284.86)  we proclaim your death, O Lord,\n(2284.86, 2288.86)  until you come\n(2288.86, 2292.86)  again.\n(2292.86, 2299.66)  Therefore, as we celebrate the memorial of his death and resurrection, we offer you Lord\n(2299.66, 2305.82)  the bread of life and the chalice of salvation, giving thanks that you have held us worthy\n(2305.82, 2310.02)  to be in your presence and minister to you.\n(2310.02, 2315.02)  Humbly we pray that, partaking of the body and blood of Christ, we may be gathered into\n(2315.02, 2318.06)  one by the Holy Spirit.\n(2318.06, 2324.1)  Remember, Lord, your Church, spread throughout the world, and bring her to the fullness of\n(2324.1, 2332.82)  charity, together with Leo our Pope, Richard our Bishop, and all who minister in your Church.\n(2332.82, 2338.98)  Remember also our brothers and sisters who have fallen asleep in the hope of the Resurrection,\n(2338.98, 2342.1)  and all who have died in your mercy.\n(2342.1, 2345.7)  Welcome them into the light of your face.\n(2345.7, 2351.62)  mercy in us all, we pray, that with the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God and Gate of Heaven,\n(2352.18, 2358.74)  with blessed Joseph her spouse, with the blessed Apostles, Saint Brigid, Saint Augustine, and all\n(2358.74, 2366.82)  the saints who have pleased you throughout the ages, we may merit to be co-heirs to eternal life\n(2366.82, 2371.3)  and may praise and glorify you through your Son, Jesus Christ.\n(2375.38, 2371.3) \n(2381.9, 2396.18)  Through him, and with him, and in him, O God, Almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, all glory and honor is yours forever and ever.\n(2396.18, 2403.18)  the Saviour's command and formed by divine teaching we dare to say, Our Father who art\n(2403.18, 2410.18)  in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is\n(2410.18, 2416.94)  in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive\n(2416.94, 2423.94)  those who trespass against us, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.\n(2423.94, 2430.62)  Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil, graciously grant peace in our days, that by\n(2430.62, 2438.52)  the help of your mercy we may be always free from sin and safe from all distress, as we\n(2438.52, 2447.98)  await the blessed hope and the coming of our Saviour, Jesus Christ.\n(2447.98, 2450.9)  Jesus Christ, who said to your apostles,\n(2450.9, 2454.08)  peace I leave you, my peace I give you.\n(2454.08, 2458.04)  Look not on our sins, but on the faith of your church,\n(2458.04, 2461.36)  and graciously grant her peace and unity\n(2461.36, 2464.16)  in accordance with your will,\n(2464.16, 2466.58)  who live and reign forever and ever.\n(2467.88, 2470.64)  The peace of the Lord be with you always.\n(2472.0, 2474.16)  Let us offer each other the sign of peace.\n(2477.98, 2503.14)  of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(2503.14, 2515.42)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(2515.42, 2529.3)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, grant us peace.\n(2533.14, 2545.14)  Behold the Lamb of God.

anything.\n(520.06, 521.06)  You're going to have to worry about anything.\n(521.06, 535.98)  A reading from the book of Genesis.\n(535.98, 545.72)  In those days, the Lord said, the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sin\n(545.72, 554.48)  so grave that I must go down and see whether or not their actions fully correspond to the\n(554.48, 559.28)  cry against them that comes to me.\n(559.28, 562.6)  I mean to find out.\n(562.6, 570.0)  While Abraham's visitors walked on farther toward Sodom, the Lord remained standing before\n(570.0, 571.6)  Abraham.\n(571.6, 581.6)  Then Abraham drew nearer and said, Will you sweep away the innocent with the guilty?\n(581.6, 586.6)  Suppose there were fifty innocent people in the city.\n(586.6, 595.6)  Would you wipe out the place rather than spare it for the sake of the fifty innocent people within it?\n(595.6, 604.94)  Fart be it from you to do such a thing, to make the innocent die with the guilty, so\n(604.94, 611.1)  that the innocent and the guilty would be treated alike.\n(611.1, 617.06)  Should not the judge of all the world act with justice?\"\n(617.06, 626.48)  The Lord replied, if I find fifty innocent people in the city of Sodom, I will spare\n(626.48, 630.58)  the whole place for their sake.\n(630.58, 640.28)  Abraham spoke up again, see how I am presuming to speak to my Lord, though I am but dust\n(640.28, 642.32)  and ashes.\n(642.32, 647.64)  What if there are five less than fifty innocent people?\n(647.64, 653.36)  Will you destroy the whole city because of those five?\"\n(653.36, 654.36)  He answered it.\n(654.36, 661.76)  I will not destroy it if I find what he finds there.\n(661.76, 670.1)  But Abraham persisted, saying, What if only forty are found there?\n(670.1, 676.82)  He replied, I will forbear doing it for the sake of the body.\n(676.82, 684.46)  Then Abraham says, let not my Lord grow impatient if I go on.\n(684.46, 689.02)  What if only 30 are found there?\n(689.02, 696.9)  He replied, I will forbear doing it if I can find but 30 there.\n(696.9, 700.62)  Still, Abraham went on.\n(700.62, 704.66)  Since I had thus dared to speak to my lord,\n(704.66, 706.82)  what if there are no more than 20?\n(709.3, 712.34)  The lord answered, I will not destroy it\n(712.34, 715.02)  for the sake of the 20.\n(715.02, 717.5)  But he still persisted.\n(717.5, 721.02)  Please, let not my lord grow angry\n(721.02, 724.58)  if I speak up this last time.\n(724.58, 729.3)  What if there are at least 10 there?\n(729.3, 733.46)  He replied, for the sake of those 10,\n(733.46, 736.46)  I will not destroy it.\n(736.46, 737.62)  The word of the Lord.\n(737.62, 738.12)  Amen.\n(738.12, 738.62)  Amen.\n(738.62, 739.12)  Amen.\n(739.12, 739.62)  Amen.\n(739.62, 740.12)  Amen.\n(740.12,

You built up strength within me Lord, on the day I called for help\n(857.88, 869.96)  you answered me the lord is exalted yet the lowly he sees\n(869.96, 879.88)  and the proud he knows from afar though i walk amid distress you preserve\n(879.88, 884.12)  me against the anger of my enemies you\n(884.12, 897.08)  raise your hand Lord on the day I called for help you answered me\n(900.36, 908.6)

He said to them, suppose one\n(1087.3, 1092.88)  of you has a friend to whom he goes at midnight and says, Friend, lend me three\n(1092.88, 1097.32)  loaves have prayed. For a friend of mine has arrived at my house from a journey. I\n(1097.32, 1104.56)  have nothing to offer him. And he says in reply from within, Do not bother me. The\n(1104.56, 1109.08)  door has already been locked, and my children and I are already in bed. I\n(1109.08, 1115.94)  cannot get up to give you anything. I tell you, if he does not get up to give\n(1115.94, 1120.48)  the visit of the loaves because of their friendship, he will get up to give him\n(1120.48, 1127.6)  whatever he needs because of his persistence and I tell you ask and you\n(1127.6, 1135.36)  will receive seek and you will find knock and the door will be open to you\n(1135.36, 1142.7)  for everyone who asks receives and the one who seeks finds and to the one who\n(1142.7, 1149.1)  knocks the door will be opened but father among you would hand his son a\n(1149.1, 1157.9)  the snake when he asks for a fish, or hand him a scorpion when he asks for an egg.\n(1157.9, 1164.54)  If you then, who are wicked, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more\n(1164.54, 1172.18)  will the Father in Heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him?\n(1172.18, 1173.98)  The Gospel of the Lord.\n(1173.98, 1190.98)  This Gospel passage reminds me of the parish that I was in when I was a pastor and there\n(1190.98, 1195.86)  was an older priest that was living in residence there, well loved by the people and all of\n(1195.86, 1196.86)  that.\n(1196.86, 1202.14)  And he had different sayings and different ways in which he would present himself.\n(1202.14, 1207.82)  He was a chaplain in the Korean War and he still wore a crew cut, but he would get up\n(1207.82, 1212.74)  there and like the old days, you know, the hell and fire brimstone type homilies, he'd\n(1212.74, 1215.46)  be banging the pulpit and things like that, but people loved it.\n(1215.46, 1219.7)  They would come and they would just enjoy watching him and listening to him, but he\n(1219.7, 1225.78)  told a story that's somewhat related to the gospel this morning and was how this woman\n(1225.78, 1230.98)  came to him one time and she kept saying to him, you know, I said a prayer to the Lord,\n(1230.98, 1235.22)  I asked for this something and I keep praying and praying and praying and I feel as if the\n(1235.22, 1240.66)  Lord is not answering my prayers because nothing is happening and he says he did answer your\n(1240.66, 1246.3)  prayer and it's no, no.\n(1246.3, 1252.5)  And people laughed, I think hopefully you would laugh too at that this morning but it's\n(1252.5, 1256.34)  a good little story because sometimes we think about it when we pray we think we're going\n(1256.34, 1261.78)  to have an instant answer and we get very frustrated when it doesn't happen or doesn't\n(1261.78, 1265.9)  occur in the way in which and the manner we desire it to be.\n(1265.9, 1272.6)  But today's readings invite us to think about one simple but powerful question.\n(1272.6, 1275.86)  What does it really mean to pray?\n(1275.86, 1279.38)  What does it really mean to pray?\n(1279.38, 1286.14)  We often think of prayer as asking for things, healing, strength, solutions to problems of\n(1286.14, 1292.14)  difficulties we may have. But if you look closely at today's scriptures, we see prayer\n(1292.14, 1300.64)  is about much more. It's about relationship, trust, and about persistence. In that first\n(1300.64, 1306.14)  reading from the Old Testament book in Genesis, we witness one of the most remarkable conversations\n(1306.14, 1315.14)  in all of scripture. Abraham speaks directly to God, interceding for the people of Sodom.\n(1315.14, 1325.14)  He doesn't just make one polite request, he negotiates, boldly, repeatedly, as it tells us.\n(1325.14, 1336.14)  He keeps asking, what if there are 50 righteous people, 45, 30, 20, 10?\n(1336.14, 1344.14)  It's not arrogance in the part of Abraham that he does this, it's faith, trust.\n(1344.14, 1352.14)  Abraham believes that God is just and merciful, and he is not afraid to speak up for others.\n(1352.14, 1361.14)  His prayer is a model of intercession, standing in the gap for those who cannot speak for themselves.\n(1361.14, 1368.14)  And what is God's response? He listens, patiently.\n(1368.14, 1371.14)  He doesn't shut Abraham down.\n(1371.14, 1374.14)  This shows us something that is very essential.\n(1374.14, 1378.14)  God invites conversation.\n(1378.14, 1381.14)  God invites conversation.\n(1381.14, 1383.14)  He listens.\n(1383.14, 1386.14)  Prayer is not a one-way street.\n(1386.14, 1393.14)  It's a real dialogue between us and a loving God.\n(1393.14, 1397.14)  The Responsorial Psalm this morning builds on this.\n(1397.14, 1405.14)  It states, on the day I called for help, you answered me.\n(1405.14, 1411.14)  On the day that I called for help, you answered me.\n(1411.14, 1415.14)  It's not a vague hope. It's a testimony.\n(1415.14, 1423.14)  God doesn't ignore us. He responds, even when we feel like He's silent.\n(1423.14, 1430.14)  Prayer may not always change our situation instantly, but it always changes us.\n(1430.14, 1439.14)  It always changes us, especially when we trust God with what's really in our hearts.\n(1439.14, 1447.14)  In Paul's letter to the Colossians, he reminds the people, and he reminds us,\n(1447.14, 1457.14)  That through Christ, we have already received the greatest gift, and that gift is new life, new life in Christ Jesus.\n(1457.14, 1465.14)  Through baptism, we are joined with Jesus in His death and in His resurrection.\n(1465.14, 1468.14)  Our sins are nailed to the cross.\n(1468.14, 1473.14)  It means that we don't come to God as strangers or outsiders.\n(1473.14, 1480.14)  We come as His people, already forgiven, already loved.\n(1480.14, 1491.14)  The Gospel, we hear the disciples ask Jesus, Lord, teach us to pray, teach us to pray.\n(1491.14, 1494.14)  And what does He do?\n(1494.14, 1499.14)  He gives them the prayer of the Our Father.\n(1499.14, 1507.14)  Not just a set of words, but a blueprint of how we are to live in constant relationship with God.\n(1507.14, 1524.14)  Notice in the prayer, worship, hallowed be thy name, surrender, your kingdom come, trust, give us this day our daily bread.\n(1524.14, 1535.14)  mercy, forgive us as we forgive, guidance, lead us not into temptation.\n(1535.14, 1542.14)  Very simple, honest, and very powerful.\n(1542.14, 1549.14)  And Jesus tells the story of a man knocking on a friend's door at midnight.\n(1549.14, 1552.14)  He keeps knocking until the door is opened.\n(1552.14, 1559.14)  And Jesus' message is very clear. Keep praying. Don't give up.\n(1559.14, 1566.14)  Not because God is reluctant, but because prayer strengthens our relationship with Him.\n(1566.14, 1572.14)  It builds trust. It opens us to receive what God wants to give.\n(1572.14, 1579.14)  And Jesus finishes with this promise. Ask and you will receive.\n(1579.14, 1585.26)  Seek and you will find knock and it will be opened to you\n(1586.78, 1588.78)  most importantly\n(1588.94, 1591.18)  He says the Father will give you the Holy Spirit\n(1592.3, 1594.98)  His very presence if we ask\n(1596.7, 1599.42)  So the question for us today is what does it mean for us?\n(1600.3, 1603.02)  It means we don't need to be perfect to pray\n(1603.82, 1608.78)  We just need to be very real to be our authentic self and the presence of God\n(1609.14, 1620.14)  It means we can speak to God boldly, like Abraham did, out of anguish, out of anger at times of frustration.\n(1620.14, 1634.14)  We can pray with confidence, like the psalmist this morning, and we can stand firm in our identity as forgiven children, like Paul describes.\n(1634.14, 1641.14)  And we can pray persistently, not give up like Jesus encourages us.\n(1641.14, 1645.14)  So we go back to where the Gospel started.\n(1645.14, 1649.14)  Lord, teach us to pray.\n(1649.14, 1651.14)  Let's make it our own prayer.\n(1651.14, 1655.14)  Not out of habit, but out of hunger.\n(1655.14, 1659.14)  Because the truth is, God wants to hear from us.\n(1659.14, 1663.14)  He wants to give us more than we can ever imagine.\n(1663.14, 1671.14)  not just what we ask for, but what we truly need, which is Himself.\n(1671.14, 1681.14)  So in the messy days of our lives, in the waiting and in the joy, and in the grind of everyday life,\n(1681.14, 1692.14)  ask, seek, knock, and trust, for God is listening.\n(1722.14, 1727.14)  All the people in this room, I can't even see one part of you.\n(1727.14, 1728.14)  You've got it.\n(1728.14, 1729.14)  You don't believe God?\n(1729.14, 1730.14)  I'm not God.\n(1730.14, 1731.14)  I'm not God.\n(1731.14, 1732.14)  I'm not God.\n(1732.14, 1733.14)  I'm not able to like God.\n(1733.14, 1734.14)  I'm not God.\n(1734.14, 1735.14)  I'm not God.\n(1735.14, 1736.14)  I'm not able.\n(1736.14, 1737.14)  I'm not God.\n(1737.14, 1738.14)  I'm not God.\n(1738.14, 1739.14)  I'm not God.\n(1739.14, 1740.14)  I'm not able.\n(1740.14, 1741.14)  I'm not God.\n(1741.14, 1742.14)  I'm not God.\n(1742.14, 1743.14)  I'm not God.\n(1743.14, 1744.14)  I'm not God.\n(1744.14, 1745.14)  I'm not able.\n(1745.14, 1746.14)  I'm not God.\n(1746.14, 1747.14)  I'm not God.\n(1747.14, 1748.14)  I'm not God.\n(1748.14, 1749.14)  I'm not God.\n(1749.14, 1750.14)  I'm not God.\n(1750.14, 1751.14)  I'm not God.\n(1751.14, 1769.18)  the right hand of the law, and keep about the right hand of the court to set up a solution\n(1769.18, 1779.14)  to these events, and it takes the right hand of the law to set up a solution to these events.\n(1779.14, 1783.14)  It was a job that was done in the working world of

Moses said to the people, if only you would heed the voice of the Lord your God and keep\n(653.68, 659.36)  his commandments and statutes that are written in this book of the law when you return to\n(659.36, 665.02)  the Lord your God with all your heart and all your soul.\n(665.02, 667.76)  For this command that I enjoin on you today\n(667.76, 671.28)  is not too mysterious and remote for you.\n(671.28, 674.88)  It is not up in the sky that you should say,\n(674.88, 678.94)  who will go up in the sky to get it for us\n(678.94, 682.68)  and tell us of it that we may carry it out?\n(682.68, 686.2)  Nor is it across the sea that you should say,\n(686.2, 688.84)  who will cross the sea to get it for us\n(688.84, 692.52)  and tell us of it that we may carry it out?\n(692.52, 695.38)  No, it is something very near to you.\n(696.28, 699.3)  Already in your mouths and in your hearts,\n(699.3, 701.32)  you have only to carry it out.\n(702.38, 703.88)  The word of the Lord.\n(703.88, 704.72)  Amen.\n(704.72, 706.38)  Praise to you, God.\n(722.52, 741.8)  turn to the Lord in your need and you will live turn to the Lord in your need and you\n(741.8, 745.94)  you will live.\n(745.94, 750.3)  I pray to you, O Lord,\n(750.3, 755.44)  for the time of your favour, O God.\n(755.44, 757.64)  In your great kindness,\n(757.64, 760.04)  answer me\n(760.04, 764.4)  with your constant help.\n(764.4, 766.54)  Answer me, O Lord,\n(766.54, 771.44)  for bounteous is your kindness.\n(771.44, 778.08)  In your great mercy turn toward me.\n(778.08, 788.24)  Turn to the Lord in your need and you will live.\n(788.24, 793.04)  I am afflicted and in pain.\n(793.04, 798.8)  Let your saving help, O God, protect me.\n(798.8, 804.24)  I will praise the name of God in song.\n(804.24, 810.64)  I will glorify Him with thanksgiving.\n(810.64, 821.04)  Turn to the Lord in your need and you will live.\n(821.04, 826.24)  See, you lowly ones, and be glad.\n(826.24, 832.32)  You who seek God, may your hearts revive,\n(832.32, 836.82)  for the Lord hears the poor,\n(836.82, 843.82)  and his own warren bonds he spurns not.\n(843.82, 849.24)  Turn to the Lord in your need,\n(849.24, 854.04)  and you will live,\n(854.04, 858.68)  For God will save Zion\n(858.68, 863.58)  and rebuild the cities of Judah.\n(863.58, 869.28)  The descendants of his servants shall inherit it,\n(869.28, 877.28)  and those who love his name shall inhabit it.\n(877.28, 882.84)  Turn to the Lord in your need,\n(882.84, 888.84)  and you will live.\n(902.36, 906.44)  A reading from the letter of Saint Paul to the Colossians.\n(906.44, 910.28)  Christ Jesus is the image of the invisible God,\n(910.28, 917.08)  the firstborn of all creation for in him were created all things in heaven and on earth\n(917.8, 924.44)  the visible and the invisible whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers\n(925.32, 933.48)  all things were created through him and for him he is before all things and in him all things\n(933.48, 941.7)  hold together. He is the head of the body, the church. He is the beginning, the firstborn\n(941.7, 949.52)  from the dead, that in all things He Himself might be preeminent. For in Him all the fullness\n(949.52, 957.28)  was pleased to dwell, and through Him to reconcile all things for Him, making peace by the blood\n(957.28, 964.08)  of his cross, through him, whether those on earth or those in heaven.\n(964.08, 966.08)  The word of the Lord.\n(966.08, 967.08)  Amen.\n(967.08, 968.08)  Hallelujah!\n(968.08, 969.08)  Hallelujah!\n(969.08, 970.08)  Hallelujah!\n(970.08, 971.08)  Hallelujah!\n(971.08, 972.08)  Hallelujah!\n(972.08, 973.08)  Hallelujah!\n(973.08, 974.08)  Hallelujah!\n(974.08, 975.08)  Hallelujah!\n(975.08, 976.08)  Hallelujah!\n(976.08, 977.08)  Hallelujah!\n(977.08, 978.08)  Hallelujah!\n(978.08, 979.08)  Hallelujah!\n(979.08, 980.08)  Hallelujah!\n(980.08, 981.08)  Hallelujah!\n(981.08, 982.08)  Hallelujah!\n(982.08, 983.08)  Hallelujah!\n(983.08, 984.08)  Hallelujah!\n(984.08, 985.08)  Hallelujah!\n(985.08, 986.08)  Hallelujah!\n(986.08, 987.08)  Hallelujah!\n(987.08, 997.08)  Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.\n(997.08, 1002.68)  Your words, Lord, are spirit and life.\n(1002.68, 1010.08)  You have the words of everlasting life.\n(1010.08, 1021.12)  Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.\n(1021.22, 1022.52)  The Lord be with you.\n(1022.62, 1023.82)  And with your spirit.\n(1023.92, 1026.96)  A reading from the Holy Gospel according to Luke.\n(1027.06, 1029.66)  Glory to you, O Lord.\n(1029.76, 1032.86)  There was a scholar of the law who stood up to test Jesus\n(1032.96, 1038.3)  and said, Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?\n(1038.4, 1038.3) \n(1039.84, 1041.6)  Jesus said to him, What is written in the law?\n(1041.6, 1043.32)  How do you read it?\n(1043.32, 1045.3)  He said in reply,\n(1045.3, 1048.42)  You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart,\n(1048.42, 1049.82)  with all your being,\n(1049.82, 1051.62)  and with all your strength,\n(1051.62, 1053.18)  and with all your mind,\n(1053.18, 1055.36)  and your neighbor as yourself.\n(1055.36, 1056.94)  He replied to him,\n(1056.94, 1058.7)  You have answered correctly.\n(1058.7, 1061.5)  Do this and you will live.\n(1061.5, 1064.04)  But because he wished to justify himself,\n(1064.04, 1065.86)  he said to Jesus,\n(1065.86, 1067.82)  And who is my neighbor?\n(1067.82, 1069.22)  Jesus replied,\n(1069.22, 1071.06)  a man fell victim to robbers\n(1071.06, 1073.8)  as he went down from Jerusalem to Jericho.\n(1073.8, 1075.5)  They stripped and beat him\n(1075.5, 1078.02)  and went off leaving him half dead.\n(1078.02, 1080.64)  A priest happened to be going down that road,\n(1080.64, 1082.0)  but when he saw him,\n(1082.0, 1084.68)  he passed by on the opposite side.\n(1084.68, 1087.54)  Likewise, a Levite came to the place\n(1087.54, 1088.96)  and when he saw him,\n(1088.96, 1091.64)  he passed by on the opposite side.\n(1091.64, 1094.82)  But a Samaritan traveler who came upon him\n(1094.82, 1097.66)  was moved with compassion at the sight.\n(1097.66, 1101.58)  He approached the victim, poured oil and wine over his wounds\n(1101.58, 1103.42)  and bandaged them.\n(1103.42, 1107.1)  Then he lifted him up on his own animal, took him to an inn,\n(1107.1, 1108.78)  and cared for him.\n(1108.78, 1111.62)  The next day, he took out two silver coins\n(1111.62, 1114.62)  and gave them to the innkeeper with the instruction,\n(1114.62, 1116.5)  take care of him.\n(1116.5, 1118.9)  If you spend more than what I have given you,\n(1118.9, 1121.7)  I shall repay you on my way back.\n(1121.7, 1123.54)  Which of these three, in your opinion,\n(1123.54, 1126.24)  was neighbor to the robber's victim?\n(1126.24, 1130.08)  He answered, the one who treated him with mercy.\n(1130.08, 1134.12)  Jesus said to him, go and do likewise.\n(1134.12, 1136.12)  The gospel of the Lord.\n(1136.12, 1138.08)  Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ.\n(1143.72, 1147.04)  One of the things I try to stress to my couples\n(1147.04, 1149.44)  that I'm preparing for marriage when we're cutting\n(1149.44, 1153.7)  to the point when it's time to pick the readings for the Mass,\n(1153.7, 1165.4)  I say, it doesn't really matter what reading you pick for the Mass, because your life,\n(1165.4, 1175.28)  my life, and therefore all of our lives, are implicated in every single page of the Bible.\n(1175.28, 1181.8)  And so I reassure them that whatever they pick, their story, and what God is doing through\n(1181.8, 1187.86)  their love, through their relationship, will be mirrored in something of sacred\n(1187.86, 1196.26)  Scripture. And so if that's true, it also follows that the story we just heard\n(1196.26, 1205.8)  today in the gospel is your story and my story, because our lives are implicated\n(1205.8, 1213.2)  every page of the Bible. And so yes, that story is about serving our neighbor and\n(1213.2, 1219.16)  those who are most vulnerable. That is absolutely true. But the Church Fathers\n(1219.16, 1225.64)  saw a much deeper reading to this story, and this is how it really pertains to\n(1225.64, 1227.84)  to our lives.\n(1227.84, 1235.04)  Because that story is about our fall and our redemption.\n(1235.04, 1236.08)  Here's how.\n(1236.08, 1238.18)  First, the fall.\n(1238.18, 1240.38)  We see that our traveler is on the road.\n(1240.38, 1244.84)  He's going from Jerusalem all the way down to Jericho.\n(1244.84, 1248.24)  In the Bible, Jerusalem is the holy city.\n(1248.24, 1253.44)  And Jericho, way down in the dumps, is the city of sin.\n(1253.44, 1255.94)  If you recall, when God's chosen people\n(1255.94, 1257.82)  were getting into the promised land,\n(1257.82, 1259.94)  they had to go through Jericho.\n(1259.94, 1261.86)  Joshua and the chosen people had to go\n(1261.86, 1264.58)  around the walls of Jericho.\n(1264.58, 1266.88)  Or our friend Bartimaeus, the blind man,\n(1266.88, 1271.5)  he's stuck begging in his own filth on the roads in Jericho.\n(1273.22, 1277.62)  This represents the fall we all experience\n(1277.62, 1282.62)  from Jerusalem, holiness, purity, innocence,\n(1283.26, 1282.62) \n(1291.06, 1298.38)  into sin. You and me, every single person has experienced the pain of this fall. And just like this man who's stuck on the side of the road left for dead, we\n(1298.38, 1307.58)  experience the same thing. We can't save ourselves from sin. We're trapped. There's\n(1307.58, 1310.14)  There's nothing we can do.\n(1310.14, 1315.06)  And in fact, the story intensifies because the priests and the Levites, who represent\n(1315.06, 1321.94)  the religion of the day, the establishment, if you will, they just walk right by the guy.\n(1321.94, 1326.96)  There's nothing we can do.\n(1326.96, 1335.32)  How often are we stuck in some addiction, some vice, some struggle, and we put all of\n(1335.32, 1341.2)  our hope, all of our liberation, our happiness, and the establishment, the forces, the religions\n(1341.2, 1345.96)  of the world, if you will, and nothing changes.\n(1345.96, 1352.24)  We put all our meaning in our work, if I just get enough money, then I'll finally be happy.\n(1352.24, 1356.92)  Enough pleasure, then I'll really be free.\n(1356.92, 1358.96)  And we're stuck.\n(1358.96, 1363.56)  And there's nothing we can do to get out of that.\n(1363.56, 1369.26)  But then, but then the redemption, there's this mysterious figure, this Samaritan, this\n(1369.26, 1375.06)  outsider who comes and recognizes this man stuck on the road and he heals him and how\n(1375.06, 1377.66)  does he heal him?\n(1377.66, 1383.26)  He bandages his wounds with wine and oil.\n(1383.26, 1389.02)  Jesus is the only Savior.\n(1389.02, 1392.7)  The way, the truth, and the life.\n(1392.7, 1395.82)  The only one who saves us from sin.\n(1395.82, 1400.02)  In Latin, Savior is Salvatore.\n(1400.02, 1402.98)  And the root of that word has a connotation\n(1402.98, 1405.38)  to do with health, healing.\n(1405.38, 1407.82)  Jesus is the divine physician.\n(1407.82, 1409.94)  Fundamentally, he's most concerned\n(1409.94, 1413.3)  about healing our broken hearts.\n(1413.3, 1415.22)  And how does he do this?\n(1415.22, 1417.5)  Look at the parable with the oil\n(1417.5, 1419.34)  in the wine of the sacraments.\n(1421.26, 1424.14)  Brothers and sisters, that's what the sacraments do.\n(1424.14, 1426.58)  They heal us from within.\n(1426.58, 1429.54)  The oil of holy anointing, of confirmation,\n(1429.54, 1431.88)  the sacred Christm of baptism,\n(1431.88, 1435.54)  and most importantly, the precious blood of holy communion\n(1437.42, 1435.54) \n(1442.8, 1451.54)  is what heals you and me who are stuck on the side of the road. That's what redeems us. And then finally, where does he nurture these wounds? We hear in the\n(1451.54, 1460.32)  parable he brings him into an inn. The inn is the church. That's where we\n(1460.32, 1467.12)  receive healing. That's where we receive salvation. What Jesus won for us is\n(1467.12, 1475.72)  applied to us through the sacraments in the church. This is our story. Without the\n(1475.72, 1482.88)  church we're stuck on the road crying out to the establishment which can never\n(1482.88, 1489.48)  save us because only Jesus through the sacraments in the inn of the church is\n(1489.48, 1491.56)  is what saves.\n(1491.56, 1494.36)  That's why Pope Francis so beautifully said\n(1494.36, 1497.76)  when someone said to him, how do you describe the church?\n(1497.76, 1501.68)  He said, the church is a field hospital\n(1501.68, 1506.36)  for sinners who are sick in need of healing.\n(1506.36, 1508.88)  You and me.\n(1508.88, 1511.56)  What a grace to know that today we\n(1511.56, 1515.68)  were called to this end by the good Samaritan\n(1515.68, 1517.44)  to receive healing.\n(1517.44, 1522.2)  How are our lives implicated into this story?\n(1522.2, 1526.92)  We're the person on the road, stuck crying for help.\n(1526.92, 1530.24)  And Jesus, the model of the Good Samaritan,\n(1530.24, 1535.4)  comes and heals us with his very blood, body, soul,\n(1535.4, 1536.52)  and divinity.\n(1543.52, 1536.52) \n(1549.02, 1555.48)  And so let us stand and profess our faith. I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all things visible\n(1555.48, 1557.0)  and invisible.\n(1557.0, 1563.16)  I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, born of the Father before\n(1563.16, 1569.48)  all ages, God from God, light from light, true God from true God. Begotten not made\n(1569.48, 1574.4)  consubstantial with the Father, through him all things were made. For us men and\n(1574.4, 1578.88)  for our salvation he came down from heaven and by the Holy Spirit was\n(1578.88, 1583.68)  incarnate of the Virgin Mary and became man. For our sake he was crucified under\n(1583.68, 1588.92)  Pontius Pilate, he suffered death and was buried and rose again on the third day\n(1588.92, 1593.12)  in accordance with the scriptures. He ascended into heaven and is seated at\n(1593.12, 1594.88)  at the right hand of the Father.\n(1594.88, 1598.04)  He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,\n(1598.04, 1600.12)  and his kingdom will have no end.\n(1600.12, 1603.92)  I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,\n(1603.92, 1606.4)  who proceeds from the Father and the Son,\n(1606.4, 1609.44)  who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified,\n(1609.44, 1611.48)  who has spoken through the prophets.\n(1611.48, 1615.48)  I believe in one holy Catholic and apostolic church.\n(1615.48, 1619.0)  I confess one baptism for the forgiveness of sins,\n(1619.0, 1621.76)  and I look forward to the resurrection of the dead\n(1621.76, 1623.8)  and the life of the world to come.\n(1623.8, 1624.78)  Amen.\n(1624.78, 1627.96)  Turning towards our Heavenly Father with great confidence,\n(1627.96, 1630.12)  we make our petitions known to Him.\n(1632.24, 1635.12)  For the church, may the Holy Spirit continue\n(1635.12, 1638.16)  to animate her missionary work throughout the world.\n(1638.16, 1639.48)  We pray to the Lord.\n(1639.48, 1641.24)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1642.12, 1645.4)  For our civic leaders and emergency responders,\n(1645.4, 1648.48)  that they may be guided by justice and compassion\n(1648.48, 1651.0)  as they work to protect the common good\n(1651.0, 1654.6)  and bring aid to those in need, we pray to the Lord.\n(1654.6, 1657.26)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1657.26, 1660.74)  For all those affected by the recent floods in Texas,\n(1660.74, 1663.54)  especially for those who lost their lives\n(1663.54, 1666.82)  and for the families still searching for loved ones,\n(1666.82, 1669.34)  may God bring comfort to the grieving,\n(1669.34, 1673.26)  strength to the rescuers, and hope to all in despair,\n(1673.26, 1674.58)  we pray to the Lord.\n(1674.58, 1677.18)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1677.18, 1681.14)  For all healthcare workers, doctors, nurses,\n(1681.14, 1683.62)  caregivers, and support staff,\n(1683.62, 1687.96)  may God bless them with strength, wisdom, and protection\n(1687.96, 1691.34)  as they compassionately care for the sick and vulnerable,\n(1691.34, 1692.66)  we pray to the Lord.\n(1692.66, 1694.2)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1695.14, 1698.02)  For all those who have died in the light of faith,\n(1698.02, 1700.94)  especially Frank and Bitsy Bolstad,\n(1700.94, 1703.06)  for whom this mass is offered,\n(1703.06, 1705.46)  and for all of our deceased relatives,\n(1705.46, 1707.46)  friends, and parishioners.\n(1707.46, 1710.06)  May the Lord and his mercy welcome them\n(1710.06, 1711.72)  into the heavenly kingdom.\n(1711.72, 1713.08)  We pray to the Lord.\n(1713.08, 1715.62)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1715.62, 1719.62)  May the silent prayers in our hearts be lifted up to God,\n(1719.62, 1722.44)  who knows our needs even before we ask.\n(1725.08, 1726.5)  We pray to the Lord.\n(1726.5, 1728.54)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1728.54, 1731.54)  Heavenly Father, we make these prayers with great confidence\n(1731.54, 1733.3)  as we ask them through the intercession\n(1733.3, 1735.84)  of Mary, our morning star and gate of heaven.\n(1735.84, 1738.5)  And we speak them in the name of Jesus, her son,\n(1738.5, 1740.98)  who is Lord forever and ever, amen.\n(1746.1, 1748.5)  Please join us in singing number 429,\n(1748.5, 1752.32)  Where Charity and Love Prevail, number 429.\n(1762.26, 1752.32) \n(1770.44, 1780.0)  Where charity and love prevail, There God is ever found. Brought here together by Christ's love, By love are we thus bound.\n(1780.0, 1788.44)  With grateful joy and holy fear God's charity we learn\n(1788.44, 1797.84)  Let us with heart and mind and soul Now love God in return\n(1797.84, 1807.2)  Forgive we now each other's faults As we of faults converse\n(1807.2, 1812.2)  And let us love each other well\n(1812.2, 1817.2)  In Christian holiness.\n(1817.2, 1822.2)  Let strife among us be unknown,\n(1822.2, 1826.2)  Let all contention cease,\n(1826.2, 1831.2)  Be God's the glory that we seek,\n(1831.2, 1836.2)  Be ours God's holy peace.\n(1836.2, 1845.64)  Let us recall that in our midst dwells God's begotten Son.\n(1845.64, 1855.56)  As members of his body joined, we are in Christ made one.\n(1855.56, 1865.24)  No race nor creed can love exclude if honored be God's name.\n(1865.24, 1876.8)  Our family embraces all whose father is the same.\n(1895.24, 1897.24)  you\n(1925.24, 1954.6)  Pray, brothers and sisters, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God, the Almighty\n(1954.6, 1970.2)  Father.

        "transcript": "(180.0, 187.0)  So, thank you very much.\n(210.0, 227.82)  Welcome to St. Bridget and Gate of Heaven parishes in St. Augustine Chapel community.\n(227.82, 231.6)  Today we celebrate the 15th Sunday in Ordinary Time.\n(231.6, 235.34)  The presider for today's liturgy will be Father Peter.\n(235.34, 239.7)  Please remember in your prayers our parishioners for whom this mass is offered and for all\n(239.7, 246.26)  our deceased relatives, friends and parishioners. We do not pass the collection basket. Instead,\n(246.26, 251.22)  we ask that you place your weekly offering into the donation boxes at the doors of the church.\n(252.74, 256.9)  Your weekly offering is very important to the ministries that we provide at our parishes.\n(257.46, 263.46)  You may also donate online. See today's bulletin for that. We are grateful for your weekly support.\n(264.34, 269.14)  Please take the bulletin home for other important announcements. Kindly stand.\n(269.7, 298.5)  As for me in justice,\n(298.5, 302.7)  I shall behold your face, I shall be filled with the vision of your glory, in the name\n(302.7, 305.98)  of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.\n(305.98, 308.5)  The Lord be with you.\n(308.5, 312.78)  My brothers and sisters, let us acknowledge our sins and so prepare ourselves to celebrate\n(312.78, 316.12)  the sacred mysteries.\n(316.12, 323.0)  I confess to Almighty God and to you, my brothers and sisters, that I have greatly sinned in\n(323.0, 328.64)  In my thoughts and in my words, in what I have done and what I have failed to do, through\n(328.64, 334.6)  my fault, through my fault, through my most grievous fault, therefore I ask the blessed\n(334.6, 341.34)  Mary of her virgin, all the angels and saints, and you my brothers and sisters, to pray for\n(341.34, 343.48)  me to the Lord our God.\n(343.48, 348.66)  May almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us our sins and bring us to everlasting life.\n(348.66, 349.66)  Amen.\n(349.66, 351.66)  Lord have mercy.\n(351.66, 354.3)  Christ have mercy.\n(354.3, 356.98)  Lord have mercy.\n(356.98, 359.18)  Glory to God in the highest,\n(359.18, 362.02)  and on earth peace to people of good will.\n(362.02, 364.1)  We praise you, we bless you,\n(364.1, 366.86)  we adore you, we glorify you.\n(366.86, 369.78)  We give you thanks for your great glory.\n(369.78, 371.98)  Lord God, heavenly King,\n(371.98, 373.98)  O God, almighty Father,\n(373.98, 377.46)  Lord Jesus Christ, only begotten Son,\n(377.46, 381.06)  Lord God, Lamb of God, Son of the Father,\n(381.06, 383.24)  You take away the sins of the world.\n(383.24, 384.92)  Have mercy on us.\n(384.92, 387.06)  You take away the sins of the world.\n(387.06, 388.84)  Receive our prayer.\n(388.84, 391.48)  You are seated at the right hand of the Father.\n(391.48, 393.14)  Have mercy on us.\n(393.14, 395.44)  For you alone are the Holy One.\n(395.44, 397.24)  You alone are the Lord.\n(397.24, 400.38)  You alone are the Most High, Jesus Christ,\n(400.38, 403.8)  with the Holy Spirit, in the glory of God the Father.\n(403.8, 405.26)  Amen.\n(405.26, 406.1)  Let us pray.\n(409.54, 406.1) \n(414.46, 416.26)  O God, who show the light of your truth to those who go astray, so that they may return into the right path.\n(416.26, 421.58)  Give all who for the faith they profess are accounted Christians, the grace to reject\n(421.58, 427.24)  whatever is contrary to the name of Christ, and to strive after all that does it honour.\n(427.24, 431.5)  Through our Lord Jesus Christ your Son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of\n(431.5, 435.34)  the Holy Spirit, God forever and ever.\n(435.34, 449.72)  Jesus, the Lord of the Rings.\n(449.72, 452.42)  A reading from the book of Deuteronomy.\n(452.42, 454.36)  Moses said to the people,\n(454.36, 457.36)  if only you would heed the voice of the Lord, your God,\n(457.36, 459.56)  and keep his commandments and statutes\n(459.56, 461.7)  that are written in the book of the law\n(461.7, 463.9)  when you return to the Lord, your God,\n(463.9, 468.1)  For this command that I enjoin on you today\n(468.1, 470.98)  is not too mysterious and remote for you.\n(470.98, 473.78)  It is not up in the sky that you should say,\n(473.78, 476.48)  who will go up in the sky to get it for us\n(476.48, 480.3)  and tell us of it that we may carry it out?\n(480.3, 483.28)  Nor is it across the sea that you should say,\n(483.28, 485.88)  who will cross the sea to get it for us\n(485.88, 488.82)  and tell us of it that we may carry it out?\n(489.76, 492.88)  No, it is something very near to you,\n(492.88, 500.32)  already in your mouths\n(521.44, 500.32) \n(508.72, 528.78)  The word of the Lord.\n(509.36, 513.52)  Turn to the Lord in your need, and you will live.\n(513.52, 517.92)  I pray to you, O Lord, for the time of your favor, O God.\n(517.92, 521.84)  In your great kindness, answer me with your constant help.\n(521.84, 525.5)  Answer me, O Lord, for bounteous is your kindness,\n(525.5, 527.88)  and your great mercy, turn toward me.\n(528.74, 532.02)  Turn to the Lord in your need, and you will live.\n(533.28, 535.9)  I am afflicted and in pain.\n(535.9, 539.3)  Let your saving help, O God, protect me.\n(539.3, 541.98)  I will praise the name of God in song,\n(541.98, 545.14)  and I will glorify him with thanksgiving.\n(545.14, 548.42)  Turn to the Lord in your need and you will live.\n(549.74, 552.72)  See you lowly ones and be glad.\n(552.72, 556.38)  You who seek God, may your hearts revive.\n(556.38, 559.42)  For the Lord hears the poor and his own\n(559.42, 563.24)  who are in bonds he spurns not.\n(563.24, 566.66)  Turn to the Lord in your need and you will live.\n(568.0, 572.74)  For God will save Zion and rebuild the cities of Judah.\n(572.74, 576.12)  The descendants of his servants shall inherit it.\n(576.12, 579.8)  And those who love his name shall inhabit it.\n(579.8, 583.16)  Turn to the Lord in your need and you will live.\n(587.24, 590.32)  A reading from the letter of St. Paul to the Colossians.\n(591.6, 590.32) \n(597.64, 603.62)  Christ Jesus is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation, for in him were created all things in heaven and on earth, the visible and the invisible, whether\n(603.62, 610.16)  thrones or dominions or principalities or powers, all things were created through him\n(610.16, 612.38)  and for him.\n(612.38, 618.2)  He is before all things, and in him all things hold together.\n(618.2, 625.64)  He is the head of the body,\n(646.7, 625.64) \n(633.88, 654.3)  in all things he himself\n(633.88, 638.78)  Through him, to reconcile all\n(662.9, 638.78) \n(647.12, 661.74)  blood of his cross through him,\n(666.94, 668.78)  The Lord be with you.\n(676.62, 681.78)  there was a scholar of the law who stood up to test Jesus and said teacher what must I do to inherit eternal life Jesus said to him what is written in the law\n(681.78, 687.66)  how do you read it he said in reply you shall love the Lord your God with all\n(687.66, 692.34)  your heart with all your being with all your strength and with all your mind and\n(692.34, 698.76)  your neighbor as yourself he replied to him you have answered correctly do this\n(698.76, 705.18)  and you will live.' But because he wished to justify himself, he said to Jesus,\n(705.18, 711.66)  And who is my neighbor? Jesus replied, A man fell victim to robbers as he went down\n(711.66, 717.18)  from Jerusalem to Jericho. They stripped and beat him and went off\n(717.18, 721.94)  leaving him half dead. A priest happened to be going down that road, but when he\n(721.94, 727.98)  saw him he passed by on the opposite side. Likewise, a Levite came to the\n(727.98, 733.76)  place and when he saw him he passed by on the opposite side. But a Samaritan\n(733.76, 739.14)  traveler who came upon him was moved with compassion at the sight. He\n(739.14, 743.56)  approached the victim, poured oil and wine over his wounds and bandaged them.\n(743.56, 750.32)  Then he lifted him up on his own animal, took him to an inn and cared for him. The\n(750.32, 754.78)  next day he took out two silver coins and gave them to the innkeeper with the\n(754.78, 759.78)  instruction take care of him if you spend more than what I have given you I\n(759.78, 765.18)  shall repay you on my way back which of these three in your opinion was neighbor\n(765.18, 771.66)  to the robbers victim he answered the one who treated him with mercy Jesus\n(771.66, 778.3)  said to him go and do likewise the gospel of the Lord\n(783.62, 778.3) \n(789.36, 795.58)  One of the things I try to stress to the couples that I'm preparing for marriage when it comes time to pick the readings for the ceremony is it really doesn't matter what readings\n(795.58, 798.3)  you pick for your wedding.\n(798.3, 808.08)  And that's because our lives are implicated in every single page of the Bible.\n(808.08, 815.28)  Our lives are implicated in every single page of the Bible, and so our story is very much\n(815.28, 818.66)  the story of salvation.\n(818.66, 823.84)  And so if that's true when we're preparing for marriage, it's also true every time we\n(823.84, 827.76)  come to Mass and hear the Gospel.\n(827.76, 833.2)  Today's Gospel is your story and my story.\n(833.2, 839.74)  And yes, part of the message in today's Gospel is to serve our neighbor, without a doubt,\n(839.74, 842.8)  in a radical way.\n(842.8, 850.52)  But there's a deeper message about the story of our fall and our redemption.\n(850.52, 851.52)  Here's how.\n(851.52, 853.24)  First, the fall.\n(853.24, 860.36)  We hear in the Gospel today that this man is on his way from Jerusalem to Jericho.\n(860.36, 864.88)  Jerusalem is the holy city, the way that we ought to be.\n(864.88, 868.68)  And Jericho, in the Bible, is way down low\n(868.68, 871.04)  and it is a city of sin.\n(871.04, 874.4)  If you recall, when Joshua was going to the Promised Land,\n(874.4, 878.28)  they had to march around the walls of Jericho.\n(878.28, 881.9)  Or our poor friend Bartimaeus is stuck on the roadside,\n(881.9, 884.32)  begging, blind and in his own filth.\n(885.32, 889.42)  And so we learn right away that in our story,\n(890.36, 897.8)  All of us fall from grace, the way we ought to be.\n(897.8, 901.32)  And there we are, stuck on the road,\n(901.32, 904.84)  beaten and left for half dead.\n(904.84, 906.24)  And what happens?\n(906.24, 908.16)  The priest and the Levites,\n(908.16, 911.12)  that represents the religion of the day,\n(911.12, 913.28)  the establishment, if you will.\n(913.28, 919.52)  Leave that man stuck and dead and abandoned.\n(919.52, 922.52)  What's the lesson for us?\n(922.52, 931.84)  When we fall, and if we try to put our healing, our salvation, in the establishments of the\n(931.84, 936.94)  world, we'll never be saved.\n(936.94, 940.28)  Nothing can get us off that roadside.\n(940.28, 942.28)  That's the condition of our sin.\n(942.28, 948.56)  We are stuck and paralyzed, forgotten, abandoned.\n(948.56, 951.6)  That's what it means by sin in the Bible.\n(951.6, 957.68)  Sin is a condition, it's an addiction that we can't free ourselves from.\n(957.68, 961.4)  And nothing in the world can take it away.\n(961.4, 969.52)  But thank God there's this mysterious figure, this good Samaritan, who comes all the way\n(969.52, 976.42)  down, gets off his beasts of burden, and looks at the man on the road. And what\n(976.42, 990.94)  does he do? He heals him with oil and wine. Jesus is our only Savior. The way,\n(990.94, 999.42)  the truth, and the life. He saves. Jesus is the Good Samaritan. He saves this man\n(999.42, 1005.06)  stuck on the road. He saves you and me how? Through the oil of the sacraments,\n(1005.06, 1010.26)  through the precious blood, the wine of the sacraments. He applies it to his\n(1010.26, 1018.78)  wounds. In Latin, the Savior is Salvatore, which has a root in healing, has this\n(1018.78, 1025.26)  root in the meaning of healing. Jesus is primarily the divine physician, the\n(1025.26, 1031.18)  healer and how does he heal with the sacraments of the church? The oil of holy\n(1031.18, 1037.18)  anointing, the sacred prism of our baptism of confirmation, anointing of\n(1037.18, 1043.82)  the sick, also the precious blood in the Eucharist. This is how we are saved off\n(1043.82, 1053.98)  the road. And finally, where does he bring the man but into an inn? What is the inn?\n(1053.98, 1060.46)  the church where we are right now. That's why Pope Francis so beautifully said\n(1060.46, 1064.86)  when asked how do you describe the church he said the church is a\n(1064.86, 1074.18)  field hospital for sinners, for those who are sick, who need health and healing\n(1074.18, 1085.14)  from Jesus the only one who saves. To call Jesus our Savior means we allow him\n(1085.14, 1090.22)  to apply the fruits of his passion through the sacraments in the\n(1090.22, 1099.46)  context of his church. How is our life implicated in this story? You and me are\n(1099.46, 1106.26)  the man or the woman stuck on the roadside. We can't save ourselves, but\n(1106.26, 1112.5)  Jesus who is the Good Samaritan comes and finds us and provides us the healing\n(1112.5, 1122.06)  and therefore the Salvator, the salvation, the saving we need. What a grace to be\n(1122.06, 1130.46)  brought to the inn, today by Jesus, where we will receive his body and his blood.\n(1135.98, 1142.78)  And so let us stand and profess our faith. I believe in one God, the Father\n(1142.78, 1148.18)  Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all things visible and invisible. I\n(1148.18, 1154.74)  I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, born of the Father before\n(1154.74, 1161.66)  all ages, God from God, light from light, true God from true God, begotten not made,\n(1161.66, 1165.78)  consubstantial with the Father, through him all things remain.\n(1165.78, 1171.24)  For us men and for our salvation, he came down from heaven, and by the Holy Spirit was\n(1171.24, 1174.62)  incarnate of the Virgin Mary and became man.\n(1174.62, 1177.82)  For our sake was crucified under Pontius Pilate,\n(1177.82, 1180.0)  he suffered death and was buried,\n(1180.0, 1181.86)  and rose again on the third day\n(1181.86, 1183.9)  in accordance with the scriptures.\n(1183.9, 1185.42)  He ascended into heaven\n(1185.42, 1188.02)  and is seated at the right hand of the Father.\n(1188.02, 1191.5)  He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead\n(1191.5, 1193.82)  and his kingdom will have no end.\n(1193.82, 1197.94)  I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,\n(1197.94, 1200.58)  who proceeds from the Father and the Son,\n(1200.58, 1203.82)  who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified,\n(1203.82, 1208.22)  was spoken through the prophets. I believe in one holy Catholic and\n(1208.22, 1213.8)  apostolic Church. I confess one baptism for the forgiveness of sins, and I look\n(1213.8, 1218.78)  forward to the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come. Amen.\n(1218.78, 1223.8)  Confident that God our Father hears our prayers, we make our petitions known to\n(1223.8, 1233.38)  him. For the Church, may the Holy Spirit continue to animate her missionary work\n(1233.38, 1239.5)  throughout the world we pray to the Lord Lord hear our prayer for our civic\n(1239.5, 1243.66)  leaders and emergency responders that they may be guided by justice and\n(1243.66, 1248.66)  compassion as they work to protect the common good and bring aid to those in\n(1248.66, 1255.1)  need we pray to the Lord Lord hear our prayer for all those affected by the\n(1255.1, 1260.18)  recent floods in Texas especially for those who lost their lives and for the\n(1260.18, 1263.1)  families still searching for loved ones.\n(1263.1, 1265.42)  May God bring comfort to the grieving,\n(1265.42, 1269.84)  strength to the rescuers, and hope to all in despair.\n(1269.84, 1271.26)  We pray to the Lord.\n(1271.26, 1273.94)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1273.94, 1278.26)  For all healthcare workers, doctors, nurses, caregivers,\n(1278.26, 1281.92)  and support staff, may God bless them with strength,\n(1281.92, 1285.42)  wisdom, and protection as they compassionately care\n(1285.42, 1287.3)  for the sick and vulnerable.\n(1287.3, 1288.78)  We pray to the Lord.\n(1288.78, 1294.88)  The Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1318.44, 1294.88) \n(1298.56, 1301.28)  especially our parishioners for whom this Mass is offered, and for all of our deceased relatives, friends,\n(1301.28, 1302.6)  and parishioners.\n(1302.6, 1305.16)  May the Lord in his mercy welcome them\n(1305.16, 1306.96)  into the heavenly kingdom.\n(1306.96, 1308.56)  We pray to the Lord.\n(1308.56, 1311.44)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1311.44, 1314.56)  May the silent prayers in our hearts be lifted up to God\n(1314.56, 1317.56)  who knows our needs even before we ask.\n(1321.08, 1322.48)  We pray to the Lord.\n(1322.48, 1324.56)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1324.56, 1327.6)  Heavenly Father, we make these prayers with great confidence\n(1327.6, 1329.64)  as we ask them through the intercession of Mary,\n(1329.64, 1331.36)  our morning star in the gate of heaven,\n(1331.36, 1333.96)  and we speak them in the name of Jesus, her son,\n(1333.96, 1335.96)  who is Lord forever and ever.\n(1335.96, 1336.8)  Amen, amen.\n(1384.56, 1386.56)  Thank you so much for being with us today.\n(1414.56, 1422.76)  Pray, brothers and sisters, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God the Almighty\n(1422.76, 1432.04)  Father.\n(1432.04, 1438.76)  Look upon the offerings of the Church, O Lord, as she makes her prayer to you, and grant\n(1438.76, 1444.44)  that when consumed by those who believe, they may bring ever greater holiness through\n(1444.44, 1452.96)  Christ our Lord. The Lord be with you. Lift up your hearts. Let us give thanks to\n(1452.96, 1459.38)  the Lord our God. It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, always\n(1459.38, 1464.24)  and everywhere to give you thanks, Lord Holy Father Almighty and Eternal God, for\n(1464.24, 1468.66)  you so loved the world that in your mercy you sent us the Redeemer, to live\n(1468.66, 1473.34)  like us in all things but sin, so that you might love in us what you loved in\n(1473.34, 1479.1)  your Son, by whose obedience we have been restored to those gifts of yours, that by\n(1479.1, 1482.72)  sinning we had lost in disobedience.\n(1482.72, 1487.48)  And so, Lord, with all the angels and saints, we too give you thanks as an exaltation we\n(1487.48, 1488.48)  acclaim.\n(1488.48, 1496.68)  Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts, heaven and earth are full of your glory, O Zana in\n(1496.68, 1497.68)  the highest.\n(1497.68, 1503.32)  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, O Zana in the highest.\n(1503.32, 1510.76)  You are indeed holy, O Lord, and all you have created rightly gives you praise, for through\n(1510.76, 1516.52)  your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, by the power and working of the Holy Spirit, you give life\n(1516.52, 1521.6)  to all things and make them holy, and you never cease to gather a people to yourself,\n(1521.6, 1526.5)  so that from the rising of the sun to its setting, a pure sacrifice may be offered to\n(1526.5, 1527.5)  your name.\n(1527.5, 1533.24)  Therefore, O Lord, we humbly implore you, by the same Spirit graciously make holy these\n(1533.24, 1536.82)  gifts we have brought to you for consecration that they may become the\n(1536.82, 1542.6)  body and blood of your Son our Lord Jesus Christ at whose command we\n(1542.6, 1548.24)  celebrate these mysteries for on the night he was betrayed he himself took\n(1548.24, 1553.8)  bread and giving you thanks he said the blessing broke the bread and gave it to\n(1553.8, 1563.32)  his disciples saying take this all of you and eat of it for this is my body\n(1563.32, 1568.16)  which will be given up for you\n(1580.52, 1568.16) \n(1587.36, 1592.34)  In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took the chalice, and giving you thanks he said the blessing, and gave the chalice to his disciples, saying,\n(1592.34, 1600.8)  Take this, all of you, and drink from it, for this is the chalice of my blood, the\n(1600.8, 1605.54)  blood of the new and eternal covenant, which will be poured out for you and for\n(1605.54, 1612.66)  many for the forgiveness of sins. Do this in memory of me.\n(1622.34, 1630.62)  The mystery of faith.\n(1630.62, 1637.46)  Save us, Savior of the world, for by your cross and resurrection you have set us free.\n(1637.46, 1643.04)  Therefore, O Lord, as we celebrate the memorial of the saving passion of your Son, his wondrous\n(1643.04, 1647.62)  resurrection and ascension into heaven, and as we look forward to his second coming, we\n(1647.62, 1650.54)  offer you in thanksgiving this holy and living sacrifice.\n(1650.54, 1656.02)  Look, we pray, upon the oblation of your Church, in recognizing the sacrificial victim by whose\n(1656.02, 1659.34)  death you willed to reconcile us to yourself.\n(1659.34, 1663.34)  Grant that we who are nourished by the Body and Blood of your Son, and filled with his\n(1663.34, 1667.3)  Holy Spirit, may become one Body, one Spirit in Christ.\n(1667.3, 1671.62)  May he make of us an eternal offering to you, so that we may obtain an inheritance with\n(1671.62, 1677.02)  your elect, especially with the most Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God, with Blessed Joseph,\n(1677.02, 1680.66)  her spouse, with your blessed apostles and glorious martyrs,\n(1680.66, 1683.54)  and with all the saints, on whose constant intercession\n(1683.54, 1686.74)  in your presence we rely for unfailing help.\n(1686.74, 1690.46)  May this sacrifice of our reconciliation we pray, O Lord,\n(1690.46, 1693.38)  advance the peace and salvation of all the world.\n(1693.38, 1695.46)  Be pleased to confirm in faith and charity\n(1695.46, 1698.32)  your pilgrim church on earth, with your servant Leo,\n(1698.32, 1701.8)  our pope, and Richard, our bishop, the order of bishops,\n(1701.8, 1704.3)  all the clergy, and the entire people you have gained\n(1704.3, 1705.56)  for your own.\n(1705.56, 1708.76)  Listen graciously to the prayers of this family,\n(1708.76, 1710.68)  whom you have summoned before you,\n(1710.68, 1713.02)  and your compassionate, merciful Father.\n(1713.02, 1714.82)  Gather to yourself all your children\n(1714.82, 1716.64)  scattered throughout the world.\n(1716.64, 1718.84)  To our departed brothers and sisters,\n(1718.84, 1720.16)  and to all who are pleasing to you\n(1720.16, 1722.04)  at their passing from this life,\n(1722.04, 1724.0)  give kind admittance to your kingdom.\n(1724.0, 1727.04)  Dare we hope to enjoy forever the fullness of your glory,\n(1727.04, 1728.44)  through Christ our Lord,\n(1728.44, 1731.4)  through whom you bestow on the world all that is good.\n(1735.48, 1731.4) \n(1741.4, 1751.88)  Through him, and with him, and in him, O God Almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, all glory and honor is yours forever and ever. At the Saviour's command, informed by divine\n(1751.88, 1759.92)  teaching, we dare to say, Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come,\n(1759.92, 1766.04)  thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread\n(1766.04, 1772.08)  and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us\n(1772.08, 1778.58)  and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil. Deliver us Lord we\n(1778.58, 1783.2)  pray from every evil. Graciously grant peace in our days that by the help of\n(1783.2, 1787.96)  your mercy we may be always free from sin and safe from all distress as we\n(1787.96, 1793.36)  await the blessed hope and the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ.\n(1795.36, 1800.2)  Lord Jesus Christ who said to your apostles, peace I leave you, my peace I\n(1800.2, 1804.44)  give you, look not on our sins but on the faith of your church and graciously\n(1804.44, 1807.96)  grant her peace and unity in accordance with your will, who live and reign\n(1807.96, 1813.64)  forever and ever. The peace of the Lord be with you always, let us offer each\n(1813.64, 1816.76)  other the sign of peace.\n(1817.96, 1823.96)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1823.96, 1828.96)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1828.96, 1834.96)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, grant us peace.\n(1847.96, 1859.64)  Behold, the Lamb of God, behold Him who takes away the sins of the world.\n(1859.64, 1862.16)  Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb.\n(1862.16, 1868.4)  Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof, but only say the word and my\n(1868.4, 1875.4)  soul shall be healed.\n(1898.4, 1913.4)  Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in him says the Lord.\n(2107.4, 2114.4)  So, thank you very much for your attention, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.\n(2191.4, 2217.12)  Let us pray.\n(2217.12, 2219.84)  and consume these gifts, we pray, O Lord,\n(2219.84, 2222.4)  that by our participation in this mystery,\n(2222.4, 2227.4)  its saving effects upon us may grow through Christ our Lord.\n(2228.16, 2229.4)  The Lord be with you.\n(2230.48, 2232.16)  May almighty God bless you,\n(2232.16, 2236.12)  the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit.\n(2236.12, 2237.36)  Go forth, the mass.\n",

        "transcript": "(28.0, 30.0)  You\n(58.0, 60.0)  you\n(178.0, 187.48)  Welcome to St. Bridget and Gate of Heaven parishes in St. Augustine Chapel community.\n(187.48, 191.64)  Today we celebrate the 15th Sunday in Ordinary Time.\n(191.64, 196.14)  The presider for today's liturgy will be Father Casey.\n(196.14, 202.8)  Please remember in your prayers our parishioners for whom this Mass is offered and for all\n(202.8, 208.08)  our deceased relatives, friends, and parishioners.\n(208.08, 210.88)  We do not pass the collection basket.\n(210.88, 215.38)  Instead we ask that you place your weekly offering into the donation boxes at the doors\n(215.38, 216.82)  of the Church.\n(216.82, 222.64)  Your weekly offering is very important to the ministries that we provide at our parishes.\n(222.64, 224.76)  You may also donate online.\n(224.76, 226.9)  See today's bulletin for that.\n(226.9, 230.16)  We are grateful for your weekly support.\n(230.16, 234.52)  Please take the bulletin home for other important announcements.\n(234.52, 241.6)  Kindly stand.\n(241.6, 249.72)  Please join in singing number 211, For the Fruits of This Creation, number 211.\n(249.72, 269.72)  For the fruits of this creation, thanks be to God.\n(269.72, 278.72)  For the gifts of every nation, thanks be to God.\n(278.72, 298.72)  For the plowing, sowing, reaping, silent growth while we are sleeping, future needs in earth, safekeeping, thanks be to God.\n(298.72, 308.72)  In the just reward of labor, God's will be done.\n(308.72, 318.72)  In the help we give our neighbor, God's will be done.\n(318.72, 328.72)  In the worldwide task of caring for the hungry and despairing,\n(328.72, 333.72)  in the harvests we are sharing,\n(333.72, 339.72)  God's will be done.\n(341.72, 342.72)  Good morning, everyone.\n(344.72, 347.72)  In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,\n(348.72, 356.72)  The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with all of you.\n(356.72, 369.72)  Preparing ourselves to celebrate this Mass in Eucharist today, we first call to mind God's love and ask His mercy and His forgiveness.\n(369.72, 375.72)  You were sent to heal the contrite of heart. Lord, have mercy.\n(375.72, 378.84)  You came to call sinners. Christ have mercy.\n(380.44, 385.96)  You are seated at the right hand of the Father to intercede for us. Lord have mercy.\n(387.56, 393.48)  May almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us our sins, and bring us to everlasting life.\n(394.84, 400.04)  Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace to people of good will.\n(400.68, 400.04) \n(407.04, 415.04)  We praise you, we bless you, we adore you, we glorify you, we give you thanks for your great glory, Lord God, Heavenly King, O God Almighty Father, Lord Jesus Christ, Only Begotten\n(415.04, 422.04)  Son, Lord God, Lamb of God, Son of the Father, you take away the sins of the world, have\n(422.04, 429.04)  mercy on us, you take away the sins of the world, receive our prayer, you are seated\n(429.04, 433.32)  seated at the right hand of the Father, have mercy on us.\n(433.32, 437.12)  For you alone are the Holy One, you alone are the Lord,\n(437.12, 440.12)  you alone are the Most High, Jesus Christ,\n(440.12, 443.02)  with the Holy Spirit and the glory of God.\n(444.64, 445.82)  Let us pray.\n(449.76, 452.32)  O God, who show the light of your truth\n(452.32, 454.58)  to those who go astray,\n(454.58, 457.72)  so that they may return to the right path,\n(457.72, 461.24)  Give all who for the faith they profess,\n(461.24, 464.08)  our accounted Christians, the grace to reject\n(464.08, 466.62)  whatever is contrary to the name of Christ\n(466.62, 469.94)  and to strive after all that does it honor.\n(469.94, 471.62)  Through our Lord Jesus Christ,\n(471.62, 473.96)  your son who lives and reigns with you\n(473.96, 478.08)  in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.\n(484.52, 487.04)  A reading from the book of Deuteronomy.\n(487.04, 488.76)  Moses said to the people,\n(488.76, 492.48)  if only you would heed the voice of the Lord your God\n(492.48, 495.34)  and keep his commandments and statutes\n(495.34, 498.0)  that are written in this book of the law\n(498.0, 500.2)  when you return to the Lord your God\n(500.2, 503.26)  with all your heart and all your soul.\n(503.26, 505.88)  For this command that I enjoined on you today\n(505.88, 509.32)  is not too mysterious and remote for you.\n(509.32, 512.08)  It is not up in the sky that you should say,\n(512.08, 514.66)  who will go up in the sky to get it for us\n(514.66, 517.74)  and tell us of it, that we may carry it out.\n(517.74, 520.5)  Nor is it across the sea that you should say,\n(520.5, 523.26)  who will cross the sea to get it for us,\n(523.26, 526.5)  and tell us of it, that we may carry it out.\n(526.5, 529.1)  No, it is something very near to you,\n(529.1, 531.86)  already in your mouths and in your hearts,\n(531.86, 533.98)  you have only to carry it out.\n(533.98, 535.26)  The word of the Lord.\n(538.78, 535.26) \n(542.26, 565.26)  Turn to the Lord in your need, and you will live in the light of the Lord.\n(578.74, 589.22)  Turn to the Lord in your need and you will live. I pray to you, O Lord, for the time of your favor, O God.\n(589.22, 599.38)  In your great kindness answer me, with your constant help.\n(599.38, 606.82)  Answer me, O Lord, for Bounteous is your kindness.\n(606.82, 614.02)  In your great mercy turn toward me.\n(614.02, 625.46)  Turn to the Lord in your need and you will live.\n(625.46, 632.02)  I am afflicted and in pain. Let your saving\n(632.02, 639.86)  help, O God, protect me. I will praise the name of\n(639.86, 647.7)  God in song, and I will glorify him with thanksgiving.\n(650.5, 658.9)  Turn to the Lord in your need and you will live.\n(661.94, 658.9) \n(674.1, 686.1)  See, you lowly ones, and be glad, You who seek God, may your hearts revive. For the Lord hears the poor, And his own who are in bonds he spurns not.\n(686.1, 697.5)  Turn to the Lord in your need, and you will live.\n(697.5, 708.3)  For God will save Zion and rebuild the cities of Judah.\n(708.3, 714.82)  The descendants of his servants shall inherit it.\n(714.82, 723.62)  And those who love his name shall inhabit it.\n(723.62, 732.62)  Turn to the Lord in your need, and you will live.\n(744.82, 750.3)  A reading from the letter of St. Paul to the Colossians.\n(750.3, 756.74)  Christ Jesus is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.\n(756.74, 762.98)  For in him were created all things in heaven and on earth, the visible and the invisible.\n(762.98, 767.66)  For the thrones or dominions or principalities or powers, all things were created through\n(767.66, 769.94)  him and for him.\n(769.94, 773.86)  He is before all things, and in him all things hold together.\n(773.86, 780.5)  He is the head of the body, the church, He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead,\n(780.5, 784.7)  that in all things He Himself might be preeminent.\n(784.7, 790.18)  For in Him all the fullness was pleased to dwell, and through Him to reconcile all things\n(790.18, 796.78)  for Him, making peace by the blood of His cross through Him, whether those on earth\n(796.78, 799.78)  or those in heaven, the word of the Lord.\n(803.78, 799.78) \n(823.78, 828.78)  Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah. Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah,\n(828.78, 839.66)  Your words, Lord, are spirit and life.\n(839.66, 847.7)  You have the words of everlasting life.\n(847.7, 858.58)  Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.\n(858.58, 860.04)  The Lord be with you.\n(861.62, 865.16)  A reading from the Holy Gospel according to Luke.\n(868.26, 870.26)  There was a scholar of the law\n(870.26, 874.94)  who stood up to test Jesus and said,\n(874.94, 879.54)  teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?\n(880.58, 884.78)  Jesus said to him, what is written in the law?\n(884.78, 885.92)  How do you read it?\n(887.18, 885.92) \n(892.92, 902.32)  He said in reply, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your being, and with all your strength, and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself.\n(902.32, 908.94)  He replied to him, You have answered correctly, do this and you will live.\n(908.94, 917.04)  But because he wished to justify himself, he said to Jesus,\"And who is my neighbor?\"\n(917.04, 925.96)  Jesus replied,\"A man fell victim to robbers as he went down from Jerusalem to Jericho.\n(925.96, 931.98)  They stripped him and beat him and went off, leaving him half dead.\n(931.98, 938.82)  A priest happened to be going down that road, but when he saw him, he passed by on the opposite\n(938.82, 940.82)  side.\n(940.82, 949.98)  Likewise a Levite came to the place, and when he saw him, he passed by on the opposite side.\n(949.98, 956.9)  But a Samaritan traveler who came upon him was moved with compassion at the sight.\n(956.9, 963.88)  He approached the victim, poured oil and wine over his wounds, and bandaged them.\n(963.88, 971.08)  Then he lifted him up on his own animal, took him to an end, and cared for him.\n(971.08, 976.6)  The next day he took out two silver coins and gave them to the innkeeper with the instruction\n(976.6, 979.48)  to take care of him.\n(979.48, 987.1)  If you spend more than what I have given you, I shall repay you on my way back.\n(987.1, 993.54)  Which of these three, in your opinion, was neighbor to the robber's victim?\n(993.54, 997.9)  He answered, the one who treated him with mercy.\n(999.2, 1003.52)  Jesus said to him, go and do likewise.\n(1004.82, 1006.86)  The Gospel of the Lord.\n(1013.86, 1018.52)  During World War II, in the closing months of the Holocaust,\n(1018.52, 1022.68)  a young German soldier, barely more than a boy,\n(1022.68, 1024.98)  was found half dead near the edge\n(1024.98, 1028.06)  of a liberated concentration camp.\n(1029.04, 1031.62)  He had deserted his post.\n(1031.62, 1034.42)  He was frostbitten and starving,\n(1034.42, 1037.66)  lying in a ditch along the road.\n(1037.66, 1042.66)  Allied troops brought him into a makeshift field hospital\n(1043.3, 1048.3)  where he was treated by a Jewish nurse named Miriam.\n(1049.9, 1048.3) \n(1051.96, 1053.24)  She had survived Auschwitz.\n(1057.14, 1058.14)  She had lost her entire family in the gas chambers in that camp.\n(1065.48, 1066.26)  And yet, when she saw the wounded soldier dressed in a Nazi uniform, she bandaged his feet,\n(1069.92, 1071.58)  fed him broth, and sat with him while he cried.\n(1069.92, 1081.92)  A fellow nurse asked her later how could you show him such mercy and kindness and Miriam\n(1081.92, 1092.4)  replied because if only I show mercy and kindness to those I like or those who deserve it then\n(1092.4, 1095.88)  mercy means nothing.\n(1095.88, 1107.4)  Mercy and showing kindness are not about them, it's about who I choose to be.\n(1107.4, 1113.88)  That kind of mercy is the mercy that Jesus spoke about in today's Gospel and the story\n(1113.88, 1116.48)  of the Good Samaritan.\n(1116.48, 1126.56)  Radical, borderless, even by some accounts a scandalous mercy that the Samaritan man\n(1126.56, 1129.04)  showed.\n(1129.04, 1133.84)  Mercy that doesn't ask where you're from or what you've done.\n(1133.84, 1136.92)  It just kneels down and helps.\n(1136.92, 1141.74)  If we turn to that gospel, we get the Lord's point very clearly.\n(1141.74, 1146.0)  Jesus is confronted by this scholar of the law\n(1146.0, 1149.16)  who's trying to test him and asks him,\n(1149.16, 1153.18)  teach him what must I do to inherit eternal life?\n(1154.54, 1158.34)  And Jesus answers with a question of his own,\n(1158.34, 1160.78)  what is written in the law?\n(1160.78, 1162.6)  And the man responds correctly,\n(1162.6, 1165.9)  you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart\n(1165.9, 1168.06)  and your neighbor as yourself.\n(1169.4, 1168.06) \n(1171.7, 1173.9)  And still trying to justify himself, the scholar presses further.\n(1173.9, 1176.76)  And who is my neighbor, he asked Jesus.\n(1177.74, 1179.58)  And then Jesus tells the story,\n(1179.58, 1182.78)  the story of a man beaten and left for dead\n(1182.78, 1185.12)  by the side of the road.\n(1185.12, 1190.12)  A priest passes by, then a Levite, religious people,\n(1190.58, 1192.9)  people who know the law of God.\n(1194.48, 1196.22)  But they walk on the other side,\n(1196.22, 1200.36)  perhaps out of fear, out of concern for purity,\n(1200.36, 1202.36)  or simply indifference.\n(1203.52, 1208.2)  Then comes this Samaritan, someone who by Jewish standards\n(1208.2, 1212.88)  was an outsider, a rival, even an enemy.\n(1212.88, 1217.34)  Samaritans and Jews did not associate with one another,\n(1217.34, 1219.92)  and their hostility was deep rooted.\n(1221.32, 1225.32)  But it is the Samaritan who was moved with compassion.\n(1226.22, 1229.18)  He does not ask who the man is.\n(1229.18, 1232.78)  He does not stop to weigh whether he is worthy.\n(1232.78, 1235.34)  He acts.\n(1235.34, 1240.38)  And here lies the radical message of Jesus.\n(1240.38, 1242.78)  Love is not tribal.\n(1242.78, 1248.62)  It's not limited to those who look like us, believe like us,\n(1248.62, 1251.9)  or agree with us.\n(1251.9, 1255.1)  Christian love does not stop at borders.\n(1256.5, 1260.74)  To practice mercy, love, and kindness without borders\n(1260.74, 1265.74)  is to stop asking, is this person one of us?\n(1266.98, 1271.3)  And start asking, what if this were me?\n(1272.82, 1276.6)  It is to see Christ in the face of the stranger,\n(1276.6, 1280.26)  the poor, the broken, and even the enemy.\n(1281.9, 1285.54)  At the end of the parable, Jesus asks the scholar,\n(1285.54, 1291.82)  which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man?\n(1291.82, 1297.42)  The one who showed him mercy, the scholar answers.\n(1297.42, 1303.74)  Jesus replies, go and do likewise.\n(1303.74, 1307.5)  Miriam, the Jewish nurse who helped that German soldier,\n(1307.5, 1309.9)  did likewise.\n(1309.9, 1314.9)  She chose mercy when bitterness would have been justified.\n(1314.9, 1320.9)  She chose healing when revenge would have been understandable.\n(1320.9, 1327.9)  She chose to see the suffering young man, not the Nazi uniform that he wore.\n(1327.9, 1330.9)  And this is the heart of the Gospel.\n(1330.9, 1336.9)  Mercy is not measured by the worthiness of its recipient.\n(1336.9, 1344.74)  It is measured by the depth of the love of the one who gives it.\n(1344.74, 1352.14)  That's the call for all of us today, not simply to admire this Good Samaritan story or Miriam's\n(1352.14, 1360.62)  story, but to become a Good Samaritan, to allow God to enlarge our hearts, to stretch\n(1360.62, 1368.54)  our comfort zones, to live out our faith in visible acts of love.\n(1368.54, 1376.46)  Jesus just doesn't redefine who a neighbor is, he breaks down every boundary we build\n(1376.46, 1379.22)  to avoid loving others.\n(1379.22, 1385.28)  To be a Catholic and a Christian is not just to worship in church, but to carry the love\n(1385.28, 1388.78)  of Christ beyond these walls.\n(1388.78, 1395.56)  And the real test of our faith is not how well we know doctrine or our prayers, but\n(1395.56, 1403.16)  how deeply we love, especially when it's difficult, especially when it costs something.\n(1403.16, 1407.74)  Many today want to be compassionate without cost.\n(1407.74, 1414.12)  When we show mercy and kindness to others, especially when it stretches us or challenges\n(1414.12, 1421.5)  As our comfort zone, we are most like Jesus.\n(1421.5, 1428.44)  Who is the wounded man on the roadside in your life?\n(1428.44, 1436.26)  Who is the person you'd rather ignore, avoid, or walk past?\n(1436.26, 1441.68)  Who is the one your heart resists loving?\n(1441.68, 1449.1)  In a world that is often torn by hatred and division, where we are tempted to draw lines\n(1449.1, 1458.58)  between us and them, may we always remember in the eyes of God that there is no them,\n(1458.58, 1469.3)  there is only us, the children of God in need of mercy, in need of love and in need of grace.\n(1469.3, 1480.38)  those words of that young Jewish nurse, Miriam, if only I show mercy and kindness to those\n(1480.38, 1488.86)  I like, or those who deserve it, then mercy means nothing.\n(1488.86, 1498.54)  Mercy and showing kindness are not about them, it's about who I choose to be.\n(1498.54, 1503.54)  So God asks us today, who do you choose to be?\n(1528.54, 1539.62)  We now profess our faith in God.\n(1539.62, 1546.74)  I believe in one God, the Father almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all things visible\n(1546.74, 1548.66)  and invisible.\n(1548.66, 1555.46)  I believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, born of the Father before\n(1555.46, 1556.46)  all ages.\n(1556.46, 1561.46)  God from God, light from light, true God from true God,\n(1561.46, 1565.22)  begotten, not made, consubstantial with the Father,\n(1565.22, 1567.66)  through him all things were made.\n(1567.66, 1571.82)  For us men and for our salvation he came down from heaven,\n(1571.82, 1575.58)  and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate of the Virgin Mary\n(1575.58, 1577.42)  and became man.\n(1577.42, 1581.14)  For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate.\n(1581.14, 1584.22)  He suffered death and was buried and rose again\n(1584.22, 1587.46)  on the third day in accordance with the scriptures.\n(1587.46, 1589.98)  He ascended into heaven and is seated\n(1589.98, 1592.18)  at the right hand of the Father.\n(1592.18, 1596.04)  He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead\n(1596.04, 1598.82)  and his kingdom will have no end.\n(1598.82, 1602.98)  I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,\n(1602.98, 1605.86)  who proceeds from the Father and the Son,\n(1605.86, 1609.5)  who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified,\n(1609.5, 1612.14)  who has spoken through the prophets.\n(1612.14, 1616.02)  I believe in one holy catholic and apostolic church.\n(1616.02, 1619.82)  I confess one baptism for the forgiveness of sins,\n(1619.82, 1622.7)  and I look forward to the resurrection of the dead\n(1622.7, 1625.44)  and the life of the world to come, amen.\n(1626.44, 1629.36)  The Lord invites us to bring our needs before him\n(1629.36, 1631.46)  with

Amen.\n(445.06, 450.06)  Let us pray.\n(450.06, 459.06)  O God, who show the light of your truth to those who go astray, so that they may return to the right path,\n(459.06, 461.62)  Give all who, for the faith they profess,\n(461.62, 468.02)  are accounted Christians, the grace to reject whatever is contrary to the name of Christ,\n(468.02, 473.06)  and to strive after all that does it honor. Through our Lord Jesus Christ,\n(473.06, 478.74)  your Son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God forever and ever.\n(486.82, 488.82)  A reading from the book of Deuteronomy.\n(489.06, 496.22)  Moses said to the people if only you would heed the voice of the Lord your\n(496.22, 500.94)  God and keep his commandments and statutes that are written in this book\n(500.94, 506.54)  of the law when you return to the Lord your God with all your heart and with\n(506.54, 513.12)  all your soul for this command that I enjoin on you today is not too\n(513.12, 520.18)  mysterious and remote for you it is not up in the sky that you should say who\n(520.18, 524.66)  will go up in the sky and get it for us and tell us of it that we may carry it\n(524.66, 532.02)  out nor is it across the sea that you should say who will cross the sea to get\n(532.02, 538.46)  it for us and tell us of it that we may carry it out no it is something very\n(538.46, 544.7)  near to you already in your mouths and in your hearts you have only to carry it\n(544.7, 549.7)  out the word of the Lord\n(568.46, 580.26)  Turn to the Lord in your need and you will live.\n(580.26, 590.66)  Turn to the Lord in your need and you will live.\n(590.66, 599.46)  I pray to you, O Lord, for the time of your favor, O God.\n(599.46, 609.1)  In your great kindness, answer me with your constant help.\n(609.1, 615.9)  Answer me, O Lord, for bounteous is your kindness.\n(615.9, 622.58)  In your great mercy, turn toward me.\n(622.58, 633.34)  Turn to the Lord in your need, and you shall live.\n(633.34, 638.3)  I am afflicted and in pain.\n(638.3, 644.26)  Let your saving help, O God, protect me.\n(644.26, 649.9)  I will praise the name of God in song.\n(649.9, 656.34)  I will glorify him with thanksgiving.\n(656.34, 666.9)  Turn to the Lord in your need and you will live.\n(666.9, 672.22)  See you lowly ones and be glad.\n(672.22, 678.22)  You who seek God, may your hearts revive.\n(678.22, 690.22)  For the Lord hears the poor, and his own who are in bond he spurns not.\n(690.22, 700.22)  Turn to the Lord in your need and you will live.\n(700.22, 709.94)  For God will save Zion and rebuild the cities of Judah.\n(709.94, 715.9)  The descendants of his servants shall inherit it,\n(715.9, 724.14)  and those who love his name shall inhabit it.\n(724.14, 729.14)  Turn to the Lord in your need and you will live.\n(745.18, 748.36)  A reading from the letter of St. Paul to the Colossians.\n(749.78, 753.5)  Christ Jesus is the image of the invisible God,\n(753.5, 756.26)  the firstborn of all creation.\n(756.26, 760.3)  For in him were created all things in heaven and on earth,\n(760.3, 762.78)  the visible and the invisible,\n(762.78, 767.42)  whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers,\n(767.42, 770.36)  all things were created through him and for him.\n(772.14, 774.2)  He is before all things,\n(774.2, 776.7)  and in him all things hold together.\n(777.58, 780.5)  He is the head of the body, the church.\n(780.5, 784.58)  He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead,\n(784.58, 788.0)  that in all things he himself might be preeminent.\n(790.1, 793.34)  For in him all the fullness was pleased to dwell,\n(794.22, 797.58)  and through him to reconcile all things to him,\n(797.58, 800.54)  making peace by the blood of his cross through him,\n(801.4, 804.94)  whether those on earth or those in heaven.\n(806.42, 807.7)  The word of the Lord.\n(810.5, 839.82)  Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah.\n(839.82, 846.38)  Your words, Lord, are spirit and life.\n(846.38, 854.18)  You have the words of everlasting life.\n(854.18, 865.78)  Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.\n(865.78, 868.5)  The Lord be with you.\n(868.5, 875.64)  A reading from the Holy Gospel according to Luke.\n(875.64, 881.18)  There was a scholar of the law who stood up to test Jesus and said,\n(881.18, 886.78)  Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?\n(886.78, 890.8)  Jesus said to him, What is written in the law?\n(890.8, 893.0)  How do you read it?\n(893.0, 899.56)  He said in reply, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your\n(899.56, 909.18)  being, with all your strength, and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself.\n(909.18, 916.42)  He replied to him, You have answered correctly, Do this and you will live.\n(916.42, 924.06)  But because he wished to justify himself, he said to Jesus,\"And who is my neighbor?\"\n(924.06, 933.18)  Jesus replied,\"A man fell victim to robbers as he went down from Jerusalem to Jericho.\n(933.18, 939.3)  They stripped and beat him and went off, leaving him half dead.\n(939.3, 946.3)  A priest happened to be going down that road, but when he saw him, he passed by on the other\n(946.3, 958.04)  Likewise, a Levite came to the place and when he saw him, he passed by on the opposite side.\n(958.04, 965.42)  But a Samaritan traveler who came upon him was moved with compassion at the sight.\n(965.42, 973.7)  He approached the victim, poured oil and wine over his wounds and bandaged them.\n(973.7, 981.3)  Then he lifted him up on his own animal, took him to an inn, and cared for him.\n(981.3, 988.6)  The next day he took out two silver coins and gave them to the innkeeper with the instruction,\n(988.6, 990.82)  Take care of him.\n(990.82, 998.8)  If you spend more than what I have given you, I shall repay you on my way back.\n(998.8, 1006.08)  Which of these three, in your opinion, was neighbor to the robber's victim?\n(1006.08, 1011.58)  He answered, The one who treated him with mercy.\n(1011.58, 1017.28)  Jesus said to him, Go and do likewise.\n(1017.28, 1027.24)  The Gospel of the Lord.\n(1027.24, 1034.16)  During World War II, in the closing months of the Holocaust, a young German soldier,\n(1034.16, 1040.78)  barely more than a boy, was found half dead near the edge of a liberated concentration\n(1040.78, 1041.78)  camp.\n(1041.78, 1049.06)  He had deserted his post, he was frostbitten, he was starving, and lying in a ditch along\n(1049.06, 1051.62)  the road.\n(1051.62, 1057.78)  Allied troops brought him into a makeshift field hospital where he was treated by a Jewish\n(1057.78, 1062.22)  nurse named Miriam.\n(1062.22, 1065.06)  She had survived Auschwitz.\n(1065.06, 1070.22)  She had lost her entire family in the gas chambers in that camp.\n(1070.22, 1079.06)  And yet when she saw the wounded soldier dressed in the Nazi uniform, she bandaged his feet,\n(1079.06, 1085.6)  He fed him broth and sat with him while he cried.\n(1085.6, 1088.0)  A fellow nurse asked her later,\n(1088.0, 1093.3)  how could you show him such mercy and kindness?\n(1093.3, 1098.4)  And Miriam replied, because if I only show mercy and kindness\n(1098.4, 1104.06)  to those I like, or those who deserve it,\n(1104.06, 1106.9)  then mercy means nothing.\n(1106.9, 1111.9)  Mercy and showing kindness are not about them.\n(1111.9, 1117.9)  It's about who I choose to be.\n(1117.9, 1121.9)  That's the kind of mercy that Jesus spoke of when He told the story\n(1121.9, 1126.9)  in today's Gospel of the Good Samaritan.\n(1126.9, 1134.9)  Radical, borderless, even on some accounts a scandalous mercy.\n(1134.9, 1139.68)  doesn't ask you where you're from or what you've done.\n(1139.68, 1142.02)  It just kneels down and helps.\n(1143.68, 1145.6)  And if we turn to that gospel story,\n(1145.6, 1148.04)  we get the Lord's point very clearly.\n(1148.04, 1151.04)  Jesus is confronted by this scholar of the law\n(1151.04, 1154.42)  who asks him, teacher, what must I do\n(1154.42, 1157.2)  to inherit eternal life?\n(1157.2, 1159.8)  And Jesus answers with this question,\n(1159.8, 1162.34)  what is written in the law?\n(1162.34, 1164.16)  And the man responds correctly,\n(1164.16, 1167.96)  you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart\n(1167.96, 1170.28)  and your neighbor as yourself.\n(1171.32, 1173.44)  But still trying to justify himself,\n(1173.44, 1178.08)  the scholar presses further, and who is my neighbor?\n(1178.08, 1180.24)  And so Jesus tells this story,\n(1180.24, 1183.5)  the story of a man beaten and left for dead\n(1183.5, 1186.08)  by the side of the road.\n(1186.08, 1191.04)  A priest passes by, then a Levite passes by,\n(1191.04, 1194.96)  Both religious people, people who know the law of God,\n(1195.84, 1198.16)  but they walk on the other side,\n(1198.16, 1201.64)  perhaps out of fear or concern for purity\n(1201.64, 1204.2)  or simple indifference.\n(1205.36, 1210.36)  Then comes the Samaritan, someone who by Jewish standards\n(1210.52, 1214.92)  was an outsider, a rival, even an enemy.\n(1215.96, 1220.4)  Samaritans and Jews did not associate with one another.\n(1220.4, 1222.78)  Their hostility was deep-rooted.\n(1223.92, 1228.36)  But it is the Samaritan who is moved with compassion.\n(1229.44, 1232.42)  He does not ask who the man is.\n(1232.42, 1237.42)  He does not stop to weigh whether he is worthy, he acts.\n(1238.44, 1242.24)  And here lies the radical message of Jesus.\n(1242.24, 1244.24)  Love is not tribal.\n(1244.24, 1247.9)  It's not limited to those who look like us,\n(1247.9, 1251.74)  believe like us, or agree with us.\n(1252.94, 1256.26)  Christian love does not stop at borders.\n(1257.3, 1262.02)  To practice mercy, love, and kindness without borders\n(1263.06, 1267.52)  is to stop asking, is this person one of us?\n(1268.48, 1272.7)  And to start asking, what if this were me?\n(1274.94, 1272.7) \n(1283.82, 1289.22)  It is to see Christ in the face of the stranger, the poor, the broken, and even the enemy. At the end of the parable, Jesus asks the scholar, which of these three do you think\n(1289.22, 1292.28)  was a neighbor to the man?\n(1292.28, 1297.86)  The one who showed him mercy, the scholar answers.\n(1297.86, 1304.86)  And Jesus replies, go and do likewise.\n(1304.86, 1311.98)  Miriam, that Jewish nurse who helped the German soldier, did likewise.\n(1311.98, 1316.94)  She chose mercy when bitterness would have been justified.\n(1316.94, 1323.02)  She chose healing when revenge would have been understandable.\n(1323.02, 1330.06)  She chose to see the suffering of a young man, not the Nazi uniform he wore.\n(1330.06, 1333.5)  And that's the heart of the Gospel.\n(1333.5, 1339.18)  Mercy is not measured by the worthiness of its recipient.\n(1339.18, 1345.06)  It is measured by the depth of the love of the one who gives it.\n(1345.06, 1351.94)  And that's the call for us today, not simply to admire the great story of the Good Samaritan\n(1351.94, 1356.94)  or even Miriam's story, but to become a good Samaritan,\n(1358.42, 1362.58)  to allow God to enlarge our hearts,\n(1362.58, 1366.02)  to stretch our comfort zones,\n(1366.02, 1370.3)  to live out our faith in visible acts of love.\n(1372.34, 1376.9)  Jesus doesn't just redefine who a neighbor is.\n(1376.9, 1380.78)  He breaks down every boundary that we build\n(1380.78, 1383.48)  to avoid loving others.\n(1384.66, 1386.28)  To be a Catholic and a Christian\n(1386.28, 1388.9)  is not just to worship in a church,\n(1390.04, 1394.08)  but to carry the love of Christ beyond these walls.\n(1394.08, 1397.72)  The real test of our faith is not how well we know\n(1397.72, 1402.28)  our doctrine or our prayers, but how deeply we love,\n(1402.28, 1404.48)  especially when it's difficult,\n(1404.48, 1406.82)  especially when it costs us something.\n(1408.26, 1410.62)  Many today want to be compassionate\n(1410.62, 1415.62)  without cost, when we show mercy and kindness to others,\n(1416.08, 1418.22)  especially when it stretches us\n(1418.22, 1423.22)  or challenges our comfort zones, we are most like Jesus.\n(1425.54, 1429.88)  Who is the wounded man on the roadside in your life?\n(1432.78, 1437.58)  Who is the person you'd rather ignore, avoid, or walk past?\n(1439.68, 1437.58) \n(1446.26, 1453.46)  Who is the one your heart resists loving? In a world that is often torn by hatred and division, where we are tempted to draw lines\n(1453.46, 1461.14)  between us and them, may we always remember in the eyes of God that there is no them,\n(1461.14, 1467.18)  there is only us, the children of God in need of mercy, in need of love, and in need of\n(1467.18, 1477.94)  grace. Maybe we can remember the words of that young Jewish nurse, Miriam. If I only\n(1477.94, 1489.54)  show mercy and kindness to those I like, or those who deserve it, then mercy means nothing.\n(1489.54, 1494.54)  and showing kindness are not about them.\n(1494.54, 1499.06)  It's about who I choose to be.\n(1499.06, 1504.18)  So God asks us today, who do you choose to be?\n(1519.54, 1542.46)  We now profess our faith in God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\n(1542.46, 1548.3)  I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth,\n(1548.3, 1551.26)  of all things visible and invisible.\n(1551.26, 1554.1)  I believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,\n(1554.1, 1556.38)  the only begotten Son of God,\n(1556.38, 1559.26)  born of the Father before all ages,\n(1559.26, 1561.68)  God from God, light from light,\n(1561.68, 1563.7)  true God from true God,\n(1563.7, 1567.5)  begotten, not made, consubstantial with the Father.\n(1567.5, 1569.82)  Through him all things were made.\n(1569.82, 1572.22)  For us men and for our salvation,\n(1572.22, 1574.1)  he came down from heaven,\n(1574.1, 1577.9)  and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate of the Virgin Mary\n(1577.9, 1579.66)  and became man.\n(1579.66, 1583.54)  For our sake, he was crucified under Pontius Berry,\n(1583.54, 1585.98)  and suffered death in Wintersbury,\n(1585.98, 1587.7)  and rose again in the third day\n(1587.7, 1590.06)  in accordance with the scriptures.\n(1590.06, 1592.52)  He ascended into heaven and is seated\n(1592.52, 1594.7)  at the right hand of the Father.\n(1594.7, 1598.22)  He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead\n(1598.22, 1600.7)  and his kingdom will have no end.\n(1600.7, 1604.58)  I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,\n(1604.58, 1607.3)  who proceeds from the Father and the Son,\n(1607.3, 1610.78)  who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified,\n(1610.78, 1613.14)  who has spoken through the prophets.\n(1613.14, 1616.94)  I believe in one holy Catholic and

of our Lord Jesus Christ.\n(2000.4, 2006.58)  At the time He was betrayed and entered willingly into His passion, He took bread and, giving\n(2006.58, 2013.1)  thanks, broke it and gave it to His disciples, saying, Take this, all of you, and eat of\n(2013.1, 2014.1)  it.\n(2014.1, 2027.46)  my body which will be given up for you.\n(2027.46, 2032.26)  In a similar way when supper was ended he took the chalice and once more giving thanks\n(2032.26, 2038.42)  he gave it to his disciples saying take this all of you and drink from it for this is the\n(2038.42, 2043.42)  chalice of my blood, the blood of the new and eternal covenant which will be poured\n(2043.42, 2047.42)  out for you and for many, for the forgiveness of sins.\n(2047.42, 2050.42)  Do this in memory of me.\n(2050.42, 2057.42)  When we eat this bread and drink this cup, We proclaim your death all over the world.\n(2080.42, 2095.74)  Therefore, as we celebrate the memorial of His death and resurrection, we offer you,\n(2095.74, 2101.06)  Lord, the bread of life and the chalice of salvation, giving thanks that you have held\n(2101.06, 2105.5)  us worthy to be in your presence and minister to you.\n(2105.5, 2111.02)  Humbly, we pray that, partaking of the body and blood of Christ, we may be gathered into\n(2111.02, 2114.2)  one by the Holy Spirit.\n(2114.2, 2119.06)  Remember Lord, your Church, spread throughout the world, and bring her to the fullness of\n(2119.06, 2126.14)  charity, together with Leo, our Pope, and Richard, our Bishop, and all the clergy.\n(2126.14, 2131.84)  Remember also our brothers and sisters who have fallen asleep in the hope of the Resurrection,\n(2131.84, 2138.5)  all who have died in Your mercy, welcome them into the light of Your face.\n(2138.5, 2144.68)  Have mercy on us all, we pray, that with the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God, St. Joseph,\n(2144.68, 2150.4)  her spouse, with the Blessed Apostles, St. Brigid of Gildare, St. Augustine and all the\n(2150.4, 2156.24)  saints who have pleased You throughout the ages, that we may merit to be co-heirs to\n(2156.24, 2163.24)  eternal life and may praise and glorify you through your Son, Jesus

May almighty God have mercy on us, forgive\n(334.92, 343.92)  us our sins and bring us to everlasting life. Lord have mercy, Christ have mercy, Lord have\n(343.92, 354.64)  mercy, let us pray. Grant we pray almighty God that just as we celebrate the heavenly\n(354.64, 359.6)  birthday of the Bishop St. Bonaventure. We may benefit from his great learning\n(359.6, 364.16)  and constantly imitate the ardor of his charity. Through our Lord Jesus Christ,\n(364.16, 368.8)  your Son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God\n(368.8, 371.92)  forever and ever.\n(384.64, 389.48)  A reading from the books of Exodus.\n(389.48, 395.7)  A certain man of the house of Levi married a Levite woman who conceived and bore a son.\n(395.7, 400.32)  Seeing that he was a godly child, she hid him for three months.\n(400.32, 406.0)  When she could hide him no longer, she took a papyrus basket, dubbed with Buddha men in\n(406.0, 411.76)  pitch, and putting the child in it, placed it among the reeds on the riverbank.\n(411.76, 417.42)  His sister stationed herself at a distance to find out what would happen to him.\n(417.42, 421.82)  Pharaoh's daughter came down to the river to bathe while her maids walked along the\n(421.82, 423.58)  river bank.\n(423.58, 428.12)  Noticing the basket among the reeds, she sent her handmaid to fetch it.\n(428.12, 433.08)  On opening it, she looked and lo, there was a baby boy crying.\n(433.08, 439.14)  She was moved with pity for him and said, it is one of the Hebrew's children.\n(439.14, 441.64)  Then his sister asked Pharaoh's daughter,\n(441.64, 444.2)  shall I go and call on a Hebrew woman\n(444.2, 446.48)  to nurse the child for you?\n(446.48, 448.92)  She said, yes, do so.\n(448.92, 452.32)  So the maiden went and called the child's own mother.\n(452.32, 454.44)  Pharaoh's daughter said to her,\n(454.44, 458.8)  take this child and nurse it for me and I will repay you.\n(458.8, 462.24)  The woman therefore took the child and nursed it.\n(462.24, 465.72)  When the child grew, she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter\n(465.72, 469.46)  who adopted him as her son and called him Moses.\n(469.46, 472.76)  For she said, I drew him out of the water.\n(472.76, 475.54)  On one occasion after Moses had grown up,\n(475.54, 477.22)  when he visited his kinsmen\n(477.22, 479.78)  and witnessed their forced labor,\n(479.78, 482.74)  he saw an Egyptian striking a Hebrew,\n(482.74, 484.94)  one of his own kinsmen.\n(484.94, 486.72)  Looking about to see no one,\n(486.72, 490.6)  he slew the Egyptian and hit him in the sand.\n(490.6, 492.8)  The next day he went out again\n(492.8, 494.9)  and now two Hebrews were fighting.\n(495.72, 499.72)  So he asked the culprit why are you striking your fellow Hebrew?\n(499.72, 505.16)  But the culprit replied who has appointed you ruler and judge over us?\n(505.16, 508.84)  Are you thinking of killing me as you kill the Egyptian?\n(508.84, 514.04)  Then Moses became afraid and thought the affair might certainly be known.\n(514.04, 518.76)  Pharaoh too heard of the affair and sought to put Moses to death.\n(518.76, 523.0)  But Moses fled from him and stayed in the land of Midian,\n(523.0, 528.84)  the word of the Lord.\n(553.0, 559.68)  with your constant help. Turn to the Lord in your need and you will live. But I am\n(559.68, 565.32)  afflicted and in pain. Let your saving help, O God, protect me. I will\n(565.32, 570.56)  praise the name of God in song and I will glorify him with thanksgiving. Turn\n(570.56, 576.52)  to the Lord in your need and you will be lived. See you lowly ones and be glad. You\n(576.52, 582.56)  who seek God, may your hearts revive. For the Lord hears the poor in his own\n(582.56, 586.6)  I run the bonds each parent's not.\n(586.6, 589.1)  Turn to the Lord, and He will be with us.\n(605.36, 608.08)  The Lord be with you.\n(608.08, 610.4)  A reading from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew.\n(612.56, 617.68)  Jesus began to reproach the towns where most of his mighty deeds had been done,\n(617.68, 624.32)  since they had not repented. Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the\n(624.32, 628.76)  mighty deeds done in your midst had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have\n(628.76, 634.68)  long, they would long ago have repented in sackcloth and ashes. But I tell you, it\n(634.68, 639.16)  will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for\n(639.16, 645.4)  you. And as for you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? You will go down to\n(645.4, 649.66)  the netherworld. For if the mighty deeds done in your midst had been done in\n(649.66, 655.24)  Sodom, it would have remained until this day. But I tell you, it will be more\n(655.24, 660.36)  tolerable for the land of Sodom on the day of judgment than for you. The Gospel\n(660.36, 670.72)  the Lord. Whenever we suffer a loss of any kind, one of those earth-shattering\n(670.72, 677.04)  losses, we accurately describe it the feeling as we're heartbroken. And this is\n(677.04, 683.12)  a very accurate description because when we experience this we feel broken or\n(683.12, 689.64)  shattered. The word heartbroken though actually comes from contrition. In Latin\n(689.64, 695.72)  the word contritus means to be shattered to pieces. I share this with you because\n(696.44, 705.16)  the Lord asks us to have contrition for our sins, and I think so often we can be very casual with\n(705.16, 713.08)  our sin, but we're supposed to be heartbroken over our sins, not because we've broken a rule,\n(713.64, 713.08) \n(721.36, 728.32)  but because they've hurt the source of love itself. Our sins offend God and that should make us broken up. That's why our Lord is so stern with the cities in\n(728.32, 733.64)  which he's done all these signs because he said you've gotten so accustomed to\n(733.64, 738.92)  seeing my magnificence, to seeing my benevolence, my love, that it's just sort\n(738.92, 744.06)  have become commonplace and he says you need to repent, you need to have\n(744.06, 749.0)  contrition. That's why the saint we honor today, St. Bonaventure, the great\n(749.0, 754.0)  medieval bishop and philosopher in his famous work on the journey of the mind\n(754.0, 760.46)  to God, he says the first meditation that anyone who's serious about the spiritual\n(760.46, 767.24)  life should do is first meditate on God's grandeur in creation and then the\n(767.24, 775.32)  next meditation is on sin or judgment to stir up that contrition in our heart\n(775.32, 782.52)  because we can't journey to God if we don't feel sorry for our sin and then\n(782.52, 788.36)  ask for forgiveness and for him to fill us and so we would do well today to\n(788.36, 794.68)  think about have I grown cold? Do I feel\n(794.68, 800.68)  heartbroken when I know I offend God? Do I take a moment to say sorry and ask for\n(800.68, 805.22)  help to do better? Because with Bonaventure if we want a journey to him\n(805.22, 810.56)  it begins by being heartbroken by our offenses and so let us stand and make\n(810.56, 817.22)  our petitions known to our Heavenly Father. We pray for Pope Leo and for\n(817.22, 821.08)  Bishop Richard Henning and for all bishops throughout the church. May God\n(821.08, 825.4)  give them the grace to be true shepherds of souls so all can come to know the\n(825.4, 830.6)  love of Christ we pray to the Lord we pray for all civil leaders governments\n(830.6, 833.74)  and elected officials throughout the world may they enact policies that\n(833.74, 837.92)  protect the church and give her the freedom to be herself so the kingdom of\n(837.92, 843.92)  God can be spread to every corner of the globe we pray to the Lord we pray for an\n(843.92, 848.68)  increase of vocations to the priesthood into the religious life especially for\n(848.68, 853.08)  members from our own parishes and our own families. May God give many men and\n(853.08, 857.64)  women the grace to respond to his call, to lead us to contrition and repentance.\n(857.64, 863.26)  We pray to the Lord. And we pray for our beloved dead, especially for Margaret\n(863.26, 867.28)  Mary Casey, for whom this mass is offered, through the mercy of God and with the\n(867.28, 873.68)  help of our prayers. May she come to see Christ face to face. We pray to the Lord.\n(873.68, 878.2)  Heavenly Father, we make these prayers with great confidence as we ask them\n(878.2, 881.08)  through the intercession of St. Bonaventure and Mary,\n(881.08, 882.72)  our morning star in gate of heaven.\n(882.72, 885.28)  And we speak them in the name of Jesus, her son,\n(885.28, 887.28)  who is Lord forever and ever.\n(966.2, 980.4)  Pray, brothers and sisters, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God, the Almighty\n(980.4, 989.64)  Father.\n(989.64, 994.96)  May the sacrifice which we gladly present on the feast day of Blessed Bonaventure be\n(994.96, 1003.24)  be pleasing to you, O God. For taught by Him, we too give ourselves entirely to you in praise,\n(1003.24, 1011.94)  through Christ our Lord. The Lord be with you. Lift up your hearts. Let us give thanks\n(1011.94, 1018.56)  to the Lord our God. It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, always and\n(1018.56, 1023.9)  everywhere to give you thanks, Lord Holy Father Almighty and Eternal God, for you are praised\n(1023.9, 1028.9)  in the company of your saints, and in crowning their merits you crown your own gifts.\n(1028.9, 1034.26)  By their way of life you offer us an example, by communion with them you give us companionship,\n(1034.26, 1039.9)  by their intercession, sure support, so that encouraged by so great a cloud of witnesses\n(1039.9, 1045.08)  we may run as victors in the race before us, and win with them the imperishable crown of\n(1045.08, 1047.46)  glory through Christ our Lord.\n(1047.46, 1052.86)  And so with the angels and archangels, and with the great multitude of the saints, we\n(1052.86, 1056.38)  We sing the hymn of your praise, as without end we acclaim.\n(1056.38, 1063.62)  Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts, heaven and earth are full of your glory.\n(1063.62, 1068.94)  Hosanna in the highest, blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.\n(1068.94, 1072.7)  Hosanna in the highest.\n(1072.7, 1077.34)  You are indeed holy, O Lord, and all you have created rightly gives you praise.\n(1077.34, 1082.78)  For through your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, by the power and working of the Holy Spirit,\n(1082.78, 1087.26)  You give life to all things and make them holy, and you never cease to gather a people\n(1087.26, 1092.86)  to yourself, so that from the rising of the sun to its setting, a pure sacrifice may be\n(1092.86, 1094.42)  offered to your name.\n(1094.42, 1100.06)  Therefore, O Lord, we humbly implore you, by the same Spirit graciously make holy these\n(1100.06, 1105.76)  gifts we have brought to you for consecration, that they may become the body and blood of\n(1105.76, 1111.86)  your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, at whose command we celebrate these mysteries.\n(1111.86, 1117.66)  For on the night He was betrayed, He Himself took bread, and giving you thanks, He said\n(1117.66, 1123.36)  the blessing, broke the bread, and gave it to His disciples, saying,\n(1123.36, 1135.36)  Take this, all of you, and eat of it, for this is my body, which will be given up for you.\n(1147.36, 1152.36)  In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took the chalice,\n(1152.36, 1157.52)  giving you thanks he said the blessing and gave the chalice to his disciples\n(1157.52, 1166.4)  saying take this all of you and drink from it for this is the chalice of my\n(1166.4, 1171.28)  blood the blood of the new and eternal covenant which will be poured out for\n(1171.28, 1179.48)  you and for many for the forgiveness of sins do this in memory of me\n(1182.36, 1195.32)  The mystery of faith.\n(1195.32, 1201.68)  Save us, Savior of the world, for by your cross and resurrection you have set us free.\n(1201.68, 1206.94)  Therefore, O Lord, as we celebrate the memorial of the saving passion of your Son, his wondrous\n(1206.94, 1211.52)  resurrection and ascension into heaven, and as we look forward to his second coming, we\n(1211.52, 1214.96)  We offer you in thanksgiving this holy and living sacrifice.\n(1214.96, 1219.76)  Look we pray upon the oblation of your church and recognizing the sacrificial victim by\n(1219.76, 1223.24)  whose death you willed to reconcile us to yourself.\n(1223.24, 1227.04)  Grant that we who are nourished by the body and blood of your son and filled with this\n(1227.04, 1230.84)  Holy Spirit may become one body, one spirit in Christ.\n(1230.84, 1235.08)  May he make of us an eternal offering to you so that we may obtain an inheritance with\n(1235.08, 1240.44)  your elect, especially with the most blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God, with blessed Joseph\n(1240.44, 1244.0)  for spouse, with your blessed apostles and glorious martyrs,\n(1244.0, 1247.24)  with Saint Bonaventure, and with all the saints,\n(1247.24, 1249.72)  on whose constant intercession in your presence\n(1249.72, 1251.8)  we rely for unfailing help.\n(1251.8, 1255.52)  May this sacrifice of our reconciliation, we pray, O Lord,\n(1255.52, 1258.54)  advance the peace and salvation of all the world.\n(1258.54, 1260.64)  Be pleased to confirm in faith and charity\n(1260.64, 1263.56)  your pilgrim church on earth, with your servant Leo,\n(1263.56, 1267.28)  our pope, and Richard, our bishop, the order of bishops,\n(1267.28, 1269.66)  all the clergy, and the entire people you have gained\n(1269.66, 1270.92)  for your own.\n(1270.92, 1274.2)  Listen graciously to the prayers of this family,\n(1274.2, 1276.18)  whom you have summoned before you.\n(1276.18, 1278.6)  In your compassion and merciful Father,\n(1278.6, 1280.44)  gather to yourself all your children\n(1280.44, 1282.16)  scattered throughout the world.\n(1282.16, 1284.52)  To our departed brothers and sisters,\n(1284.52, 1285.82)  and to all who are pleasing to you\n(1285.82, 1287.76)  at their passing from this life,\n(1287.76, 1289.72)  give kind admittance to your kingdom.\n(1289.72, 1292.72)  There we hope to enjoy forever the fullness of your glory,\n(1292.72, 1294.2)  through Christ our Lord,\n(1294.2, 1297.1)  through whom you bestow on the world all that is good.\n(1299.66, 1306.84)  Through Him, and with Him, and in Him, O God Almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy\n(1306.84, 1313.82)  Spirit, all glory and honor is yours, forever and ever.\n(1313.82, 1319.68)  At the Saviour's command, informed by divine teaching, we dare to say,\n(1319.68, 1324.04)  Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.\n(1324.04, 1328.88)  Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.\n(1328.88, 1335.04)  Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who\n(1335.04, 1341.52)  trespass against us, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.\n(1341.52, 1346.18)  Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil, graciously grant peace in our days, that by\n(1346.18, 1351.28)  the help of your mercy we may be always free from sin, and safe from all distress, as we\n(1351.28, 1359.28)  We await the blessed hope and the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ.\n(1359.28, 1361.24)  Lord Jesus Christ, who said to your apostles,\n(1361.24, 1364.0)  Peace I leave you, my peace I give you.\n(1364.0, 1366.74)  Look not on our sins, but on the faith of your church,\n(1366.74, 1370.16)  and graciously grant her peace and unity in accordance with your will,\n(1370.16, 1372.64)  who live and reign forever and ever.\n(1372.64, 1375.84)  The peace of the Lord be with you always.\n(1375.84, 1381.04)  Let us offer each other this sign of peace.\n(1381.04, 1386.48)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1386.48, 1391.6)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1391.6, 1410.36)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, grant us peace.\n(1410.36, 1416.44)  Behold the Lamb of God, and behold Him who takes away the sins of the world.\n(1416.44, 1419.04)  Blessed are those called to the Supper of the Lamb.\n(1419.04, 1424.78)  Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof, but only say the word and my\n(1424.78, 1431.78)  my soul shall be healed.\n(1454.78, 1471.82)  He who ponders the law of the Lord day and night will yield his fruit in due season.\n(1601.78, 1608.78)  So, thank you very much for your attention and I look forward to seeing you again soon.\n(1690.78, 1707.74)  Let us pray.\n(1707.74, 1714.14)  Through Christ the Teacher, O Lord, instruct those you feed with Christ the living bread,\n(1714.14, 1719.82)  that on the feast day of blessed Bonaventure they may learn your truth and express it in\n(1719.82, 1726.84)

in God's grace in the cooling air\n(296.32, 298.24)  of crushing words of Christ today.\n(298.24, 302.88)  In the name of the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit, amen, the Lord be with you.\n(302.88,

everlasting\n(320.72, 321.72)  life.\n(321.72, 327.24)  Today we celebrate the feast of Saint Bonaventure, who was a Franciscan, and let us ask the Lord\n(327.24, 330.0)  to strengthen us with God's word, mercy, and love\n(330.0, 331.56)  this day in the gospel.\n(331.56, 334.8)  Grant, we pray, almighty God, that just as we celebrate\n(334.8, 338.16)  the heavenly birthday of Bishop Saint Bonaventure,\n(338.16, 340.4)  we may benefit from his great learning\n(340.4, 343.44)  and constantly imitate the honor of his charity\n(343.44, 345.16)  through our Lord Jesus Christ, your son,\n(345.16, 346.6)  who lives and reigns with you\n(346.6, 348.72)  in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\n(348.72, 351.6)  one God forever and ever, amen.\n(351.6, 354.72)  Please be seated, let us be attentive to God's sacred word.\n(357.24, 368.24)  A reading from the book of Exodus.\n(368.24, 377.36)  A certain man of the house of Levi married a Levite woman who conceived and bore a son.\n(377.36, 383.64)  Seeing that she was a goodly child, she hid him for three months.\n(383.64, 390.86)  When she could hide him no longer, she took a papyrus basket, daubed it with bitumen and\n(390.86, 398.74)  pitch, and putting the child in it, placed it among the reeds on the riverbank.\n(398.74, 407.7)  His sister stationed herself at a distance to find out what would happen to him.\n(407.7, 416.1)  Gero's daughter came down to the river to bathe, while her maids walked along the riverbank.\n(416.1, 422.58)  Noticing the basket among the reeds, she sent her handmaid to fetch it.\n(422.58, 430.22)  On opening it, she looked, and lo, there was a baby boy crying.\n(430.22, 438.42)  She was moved with pity for him and said it is one of the Hebrew's children.\n(438.42, 444.54)  Then his sister asked Pharaoh's daughter, shall I go and call one of the Hebrew women\n(444.54, 447.38)  to nurse the child for you?\n(447.38, 451.28)  Yes, do so, she answered.\n(451.28, 456.94)  So the maiden went and called the child's own mother.\n(456.94, 466.24)  Pharaoh's daughter said to her take this child and nurse it for me and I will repay you.\n(466.24, 471.2)  The woman therefore took the child and nursed it.\n(471.2, 479.28)  When the child grew she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter who adopted him as her son and called\n(479.28, 487.78)  him Moses, for she said, I drew him out of the water.\n(487.78, 494.72)  On one occasion after Moses had grown up, when he visited his kinsmen and witnessed\n(494.72, 504.0)  their forced labor, he saw an Egyptian striking a Hebrew, one of his own kinsmen.\n(504.0, 513.52)  about and seeing no one, he slew the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.\n(513.52, 519.6)  The next day he went out again, and now two Hebrews were fighting.\n(519.6, 525.42)  So he asked the culprit, why are you striking your fellow Hebrew?\n(525.42, 532.52)  But the culprit replied, who has appointed you ruler and judge over us?\n(532.52, 538.02)  Are you thinking of killing me as you killed the Egyptian?\n(538.02, 545.0)  Then Moses became afraid and thought, the affair must certainly be known.\n(545.0, 551.04)  Pharaoh too heard of the affair and sought to put Moses to death.\n(551.04, 556.96)  But Moses fled from him and stayed in the land of Midian.\n(556.96, 557.96)  The word of the Lord.\n(557.96, 559.84)  Thanks be to God.\n(559.84, 566.76)  Turn to the Lord in your need and you will live.\n(566.76, 572.36)  I am sunk in the abysmal swamp where there is no foothold.\n(572.36, 575.24)  I have reached the watery depths.\n(575.24, 581.28)  The flood overwhelms me.\n(581.28, 587.2)  But I pray to you, O Lord, for the time of your favor, O God.\n(587.2, 599.2)  In your great kindness answer me with your constant help, but I am afflicted and in pain.\n(599.2, 602.76)  Let your saving help, O God, protect me.\n(602.76, 613.28)  I will praise the name of God in song, and I will glorify him with thanksgiving.\n(613.28, 616.4)  See you lowly ones and be glad.\n(616.4, 620.32)  You who seek God, may your hearts revive.\n(620.32, 626.28)  For the Lord hears the poor, and his own who are in bonds he spurns not.\n(626.28, 629.28)  Turn to the Lord if you will live.\n(643.28, 654.92)  The Lord be with you.\n(654.92, 659.18)  Reading from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew.\n(659.18, 663.64)  At that time Jesus explained, I give praise to you Father, Lord of heaven and earth, for\n(663.64, 667.36)  although you have hidden these things from the wise and the learned, you have revealed\n(667.36, 668.6)  them to the childlike.\n(668.6, 671.88)  Yes, Father, such has been your gracious will.\n(671.88, 674.72)  while things have been handed over to me by my Father.\n(674.72, 676.92)  No one knows the Son except the Father,\n(676.92, 679.4)  and no one knows the Father except the Son,\n(679.4, 682.44)  and anyone to whom the Son wishes to reveal Him.\n(682.44, 686.92)  The Gospel of the Lord, praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ.\n(686.92, 689.4)  As we come to celebrate the journey of faith today,\n(689.4, 691.84)  we ask the Lord to be aware of mercy\n(691.84, 693.76)  and compassion and love.\n(693.76, 697.88)  July 15th, today I think of, as I was coming to mass\n(697.88, 700.24)  and thinking yesterday, preparing for the liturgy,\n(700.24, 702.0)  We offer our mass for Patrick today,\n(702.0, 703.64)  but I was thinking of my grandfather.\n(703.64, 707.2)  He was buried on July 15th, 1970,\n(707.2, 709.08)  and it was a day like today.\n(709.08, 711.36)  Oh my God, it must have been 110,\n(711.36, 713.68)  and the priest will never forget it,\n(713.68, 718.68)  friends of the family, because the abbot of Spencer\n(719.4, 722.3)  came to celebrate the mass, which was very unusual,\n(723.24, 725.6)  and he went on for 35 minutes.\n(725.6, 728.16)  Oh my God, I thought we were gonna sweat to death.\n(728.16, 730.98)  But today, the warm weather makes us realize\n(730.98, 734.6)  how lucky we are to be in a beautiful community of faith\n(734.6, 736.96)  in the United States, and all the struggles.\n(736.96, 739.04)  We think of the people along the river,\n(739.04, 742.24)  how sad those deaths are, and also in Fall River.\n(742.24, 744.48)  But the gospel today is about the gift\n(744.48, 745.72)  of God's compassionate love.\n(745.72, 747.2)  There was an option in the reading today,\n(747.2, 750.6)  and I chose the reading of the option.\n(750.6, 753.04)  But Saint Bonaventure was a scholar.\n(753.04, 755.96)  He was in Paris for many years.\n(755.96, 758.8)  He was a Franciscan, so he really had that spirit\n(758.8, 760.92)  of community and love and friendship\n(760.92, 762.92)  and reaching out to the poor.\n(762.92, 765.56)  And today, the gospel really is focusing\n(765.56, 767.66)  on the compassionate love of mercy.\n(767.66, 770.88)  No matter where we are, what we do, where we go,\n(770.88, 774.64)  we have to hold on to Christ's mercy and love.\n(774.64, 776.64)  The second reading that was an option today\n(776.64, 779.52)  focused on the harshness of Christ\n(779.52, 781.64)  really dealing with those that weren't following\n(781.64, 783.36)  the letter of the law.\n(783.36, 786.24)  and it said, today, look at God's compassion\n(786.24, 787.36)  around your church.\n(787.36, 788.88)  That was one of the suggestions.\n(788.88, 791.12)  Do you see statues that remind you\n(791.12, 793.48)  of God's forgiveness and compassionate love?\n(793.48, 795.52)  And at this beautiful church of Gate of Heaven\n(795.52, 798.44)  in St. Bridget's, oh my God, through Father Casey\n(798.44, 801.32)  and others, you've got beautiful images of statues.\n(801.32, 804.96)  I love the compassionate love of Christ with the children\n(804.96, 806.28)  out here in the garden.\n(806.28, 809.68)  That's in memory of all the sisters and lay people\n(809.68, 812.72)  that worked in the school for many years, Gate of Heaven.\n(812.72, 816.88)  but also Mary and Our Blessed Lady and Joseph, St. Bridget's.\n(816.88, 820.96)  So today, look at those images that suggestion meant,\n(820.96, 823.68)  and don't see the harshness of correction,\n(823.68, 827.3)  but see the loving hand of mercy, compassionate love.\n(827.3, 829.16)  May we be images of that today\n(829.16, 832.12)  wherever we go on our journey of faith.\n(832.12, 833.36)  Let us stand this hot day\n(833.36, 835.96)  and enter into our prayer the faithfulness day.\n(835.96, 838.4)  Loving God, we pray for God's people,\n(838.4, 840.76)  that we may know God's love each day in our hearts.\n(840.76, 842.1)  We pray to the Lord.\n(842.72, 844.54)  For those that suffer, those who are ill,\n(844.64, 848.52)  those who are paralyzed, those who rely on others to help them\n(848.62, 850.96)  in nursing homes and other caring centers,\n(851.06, 854.86)  and our parishioners of our parish, we pray to the Lord.\n(854.96, 857.5)  We pray for you, the early bird, sometimes your call,\n(857.6, 861.7)  for your kindness, faithfulness, we pray to the Lord.\n(861.8, 863.56)  And for all those that are here this morning,\n(863.66, 867.06)  whatever need you have, may God hear it in your heart.\n(867.16, 869.8)  Remember, Christ heals our wounds,\n(869.9, 869.8) \n(877.2, 899.8)  Even our hidden rules that are only known to him. We ask this through Christ our Lord. Amen. Let us celebrate\n(957.2, 970.64)  You offer a Mass with Patricia M. Reynolds today, Patricia M. Reynolds. Pray my brothers and sisters that this sacrifice may be acceptable to God the Almighty Father.\n(970.64, 974.04)  Loving and gracious God, we offer the gifts of your love this day in prayer.\n(974.04, 978.56)  Fill our hearts with your love as we offer these gifts to you through Christ Jesus, our\n(978.56, 979.56)  Lord.\n(979.56, 982.4)  My friends, the Lord be with you.\n(982.4, 984.64)  Lift up your hearts.\n(984.64, 990.08)  us give thanks to the Lord our God. It is truly right and just our duty and our\n(990.08, 994.72)  salvation always and everywhere to give you thanks Lord Holy Father almighty\n(994.72, 999.52)  eternal God through Christ our Lord. For on a festival as we celebrate St.\n(999.52, 1003.84)  Bonaventure you bid your church to rejoice so too we are strengthened by\n(1003.84, 1008.8)  the example of his holy light. Teach us by his words of preaching and keep her\n(1008.8, 1013.28)  safe and answer to her prayers. We ask that as we join the company of angels\n(1013.28, 1018.28)  and saints, we sing the hymn of your glory, as without end we acclaim.\n(1018.28, 1024.96)  Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts, heaven and earth are full of your glory, Hosanna\n(1024.96, 1025.96)  in the highest.\n(1025.96, 1031.88)  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, Hosanna in the highest.\n(1031.88, 1034.48)  You are indeed holy, O Lord, the fount of all holiness.\n(1034.48, 1039.56)  Make holy these gifts, we pray, by sending down your Spirit upon them like the dewfall,\n(1039.56, 1045.56)  that they may become for us the body and blood of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.\n(1045.56, 1050.06)  At the time he was betrayed and entered willingly into his passion,\n(1050.06, 1054.56)  he took bread and, giving thanks, broke it, gave it to his disciples, saying,\n(1054.56, 1060.56)  Take this, all of you, and eat of it, for this is my body which will be given up for you.\n(1066.06, 1069.06)  In a similar way, when supper was entered, he took the chalice,\n(1069.06, 1073.06)  Once more giving thanks, he gave it to his disciples, saying,\n(1073.06, 1075.06)  Take this, all of you, and drink from it.\n(1075.06, 1080.06)  For this is the chalice of my blood, the blood of the new and eternal covenant,\n(1080.06, 1083.06)  which will be poured out for you and for many.\n(1083.06, 1088.06)  For the forgiveness of sins, do this in memory of me.\n(1096.06, 1088.06) \n(1101.54, 1104.34)  The mystery of faith, when we eat this bread and drink this cup, we proclaim your death, O Lord, until you come again.\n(1104.34, 1109.58)  Therefore, as we celebrate the memorial of his death and resurrection, we offer you,\n(1109.58, 1114.58)  Lord, the bread of life and the chalice of salvation, giving thanks that you held us\n(1114.58, 1118.58)  worthy to be in your presence and minister to you.\n(1118.58, 1124.9)  Humbly we pray that partaking of the body and blood of Christ,\n(1124.9, 1129.22)  we may be gathered into one by the Holy Spirit.\n(1129.22, 1132.18)  Remember, Lord, your Church spread throughout the world.\n(1132.18, 1133.78)  Bring her to the fullness of charity\n(1133.78, 1137.54)  together with Leo our Pope, Francis Richard our Bishop,\n(1137.54, 1139.1)  and all the clergy.\n(1139.1, 1142.3)  Today we remember our sister in Christ, Patricia Reynolds.\n(1142.3, 1145.74)  Lord, remember that you have coughed from to yourself.\n(1145.74, 1152.06)  Grant that Patricia, who was united with your son in a death like his, may also be one with\n(1152.06, 1154.86)  him in his resurrection.\n(1154.86, 1159.38)  Remember our brothers and sisters who have fallen asleep in the hope of the resurrection\n(1159.38, 1162.74)  and all who have died in your mercy.\n(1162.74, 1165.04)  Welcome them into the light of your face.\n(1165.04, 1170.34)  Have mercy on us all, we pray, with the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God, St. Bonaventure\n(1170.34, 1176.1)  and all the saints who have pleased you throughout the ages, that we may merit to be co-weirs\n(1176.1, 1183.1)  to eternal life, and praise and glorify you through your Son, Jesus Christ.\n(1184.18, 1189.14)  Through him, with and in him, O God Almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, all\n(1189.14, 1196.14)  glory and honor is yours forever and ever. Amen.\n(1196.26, 1196.14) \n(1200.66, 1203.9)  At the Savior's command, informed by divine teaching, we dare to say, our Father.\n(1203.9, 1206.82)  Father in heaven, hello, hear thy name.\n(1206.82, 1209.54)  Thy kingdom come, thy will be done\n(1209.54, 1211.7)  on earth as it is in heaven.\n(1211.7, 1214.3)  Give us this day our daily bread,\n(1214.3, 1216.58)  and forgive us our trespasses,\n(1216.58, 1219.96)  as we forgive those who trespass against us,\n(1219.96, 1222.3)  and lead us not into temptation,\n(1222.3, 1224.34)  but deliver us from evil.\n(1224.34, 1227.34)  Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil.\n(1227.34, 1230.04)  Graciously grant peace in our days,\n(1230.04, 1231.84)  that by the help of your mercy\n(1231.84, 1234.42)  we may be always free from sin,\n(1234.42, 1238.58)  safe from all distress, as we await the blessed hope\n(1238.58, 1241.9)  and the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ.\n(1241.9, 1244.98)  For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours,\n(1244.98, 1246.86)  now and forever.\n(1246.86, 1249.66)  Lord Jesus Christ, who sent your apostles,\n(1249.66, 1251.94)  peace I leave you, my peace I give you.\n(1251.94, 1255.06)  Look not on our sins, but on the faith of your church,\n(1255.06, 1258.26)  and graciously grant her peace and unity\n(1258.26, 1260.34)  in accordance with your will,\n(1260.34, 1263.5)  who live and reign forever and ever.\n(1263.5, 1264.5)  On this beautiful day,\n(1264.5, 1267.06)  may the peace of the Lord be with you always.\n(1268.18, 1270.42)  Let us offer each other a sign of that peace.\n(1274.38, 1277.46)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world,\n(1277.46, 1278.98)  have mercy on us.\n(1278.98, 1282.02)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world.\n(1282.02, 1283.58)  Have mercy on us.\n(1283.58, 1286.64)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world.\n(1286.64, 1287.8)  Grant us peace.\n(1289.64, 1290.8)  Behold the Lamb of God.\n(1290.8, 1292.92)  Behold him who takes away the sins of the world.\n(1292.92, 1295.76)  How blessed are we with power to the supper of the Lamb.\n(1295.76, 1298.68)  Lord, I am not worthy that you enter into my room.\n(1298.68, 1301.6)  But only say the word and my soul shall be healed.\n(1301.6, 1302.92)  May the body and blood of Christ\n(1302.92, 1304.64)  bring us all to everlasting life.\n(1308.98, 1315.98)  Thank you so much for being with us today, and we look forward to seeing you again soon.\n(1315.98, 1319.98)  Thank you so much for being with us today, and we look forward to seeing you again soon.\n(1319.98, 1322.98)  Thank you so much for being with us today, and we look forward to seeing you again soon.\n(1322.98, 1325.98)  Thank you so much for being with us today, and we look forward to seeing you again soon.\n(1325.98, 1326.98)  Thank you so much for being with us today, and we look forward to seeing you again soon.\n(1326.98, 1327.98)  Thank you so much for being with us today, and we look forward to seeing you again soon.\n(1327.98, 1328.98)  Thank you so much for being with us today, and we look forward to seeing you again soon.\n(1328.98, 1329.98)  Thank you so much for being with us today, and we look forward to seeing you again soon.\n(1329.98, 1330.98)  Thank you so much for being with us today, and we look forward to seeing you again soon.\n(1330.98, 1331.98)  Thank you so much for being with us today, and we look forward to seeing you again soon.\n(1331.98, 1332.98)  Thank you so much for being with us today, and we look forward to seeing you again soon.\n(1332.98, 1333.98)  Thank you so much for being with us today, and we look forward to seeing you again soon.\n(1333.98, 1334.98)  Thank you so much for being with us today, and we look forward to seeing you again soon.\n(1334.98, 1335.98)  Thank you so much for being with us today, and we look forward to seeing you again soon.\n(1335.98, 1336.98)  Thank you so much for being with us today, and we look forward to seeing you again soon.\n(1336.98, 1337.98)  Thank you so much for being with us today, and we look forward to seeing you again soon.\n(1337.98, 1362.98)  heart to recall,

Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty, God in three persons, blessed Trinity.\n(294.52, 296.96)  Good morning everyone.\n(296.96, 301.38)  In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.\n(301.38, 306.06)  The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the communion of the Holy\n(306.06, 309.72)  Spirit be with all of you.\n(309.72, 318.3)  Preparing ourselves for this Mass today, we acknowledge our sins and ask the Lord's forgiveness.\n(318.3, 323.76)  You were sent to heal the contrite of heart, Lord have mercy.\n(323.76, 328.46)  You came to call sinners, Christ have mercy.\n(328.46, 335.38)  You are seated at the right hand of the Father to intercede for us, Lord have mercy.\n(335.38, 342.7)  May Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us our sins and bring us to everlasting life.\n(342.7, 348.3)  Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace to people of good will.\n(348.3, 354.82)  We praise you, we bless you, we adore you, we glorify you, we give you thanks for your\n(354.82, 361.82)  great glory, Lord God, Heavenly King, O God Almighty Father, Lord Jesus Christ,\n(361.82, 369.22)  Only Begotten Son, Lord God, Lamb of God, Son of the Father, you take away the sins\n(369.22, 374.9)  of the world, have mercy on us. You take away the sins of the world, receive our\n(374.9, 381.52)  prayer. You are seated at the right hand of the Father, have mercy on us. For you\n(381.52, 387.12)  alone are the Holy One, you alone are the Lord, you alone are the Most High, Jesus\n(387.12, 392.6)  Christ, with the Holy Spirit, in the glory of God the Father. Amen.\n(392.6, 401.32)  Let us pray. Show favor, O Lord, to your servants and mercifully increase the\n(401.32, 407.36)  gifts of your grace that made fervent in hope, faith, and charity. They may be ever\n(407.36, 412.66)  watchful in keeping your commands. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son\n(412.66, 416.48)  who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God forever\n(416.48, 419.68)  and ever.\n(427.08, 431.76)  A reading from the book of Genesis. The Lord appeared to Abraham by the\n(431.76, 437.28)  terebinth of Mamre as he sat at the entrance of his tent. While the day was\n(437.28, 443.32)  was growing hot.\n(465.94, 443.32) \n(447.32, 449.32)  When he saw them, he ran from the entrance of the tent to greet them. Bowing to the ground, he said,\n(449.32, 455.32)  Sir, if I may ask you this favor, please do not go on past your servant.\n(455.32, 462.32)  Let some water be brought, that you may bathe your feet, and then rest yourselves under the tree.\n(462.32, 466.32)  Now that you have come this close to your servant, let me bring you a little food,\n(466.32, 472.32)  that you may refresh yourselves, and afterward you may go on your way.\n(472.32, 477.52)  Then replied, very well, do as you have said.\n(477.52, 483.42)  Abraham hastened into the tent and told Sarah, quick, three measures of fine flour, knead\n(483.42, 485.76)  it and make rolls.\n(485.76, 491.3)  He ran to the herd, picked out a tender choice steer and gave it to a servant who quickly\n(491.3, 493.24)  prepared it.\n(493.24, 499.22)  Then Abraham got some curds and milk, as well as the steer that had been prepared, and set\n(499.22, 501.68)  these before the three men.\n(501.68, 507.96)  and he waited on them\n(531.42, 507.96) \n(517.54, 537.56)  Where is your wife, Sarah?\"\n(517.54, 524.48)  at this time next year,\n(546.64, 524.48) \n(531.12, 554.18)  The word of the Lord.\n(531.12, 540.3)  He who does justice will live\n(556.42, 540.3) \n(545.6, 568.92)  The man who walks blamelessly\n(545.6, 553.98)  who slanders not with his tongue,\n(568.66, 553.98) \n(562.62, 583.4)  who harms not his fellowman,\n(562.62, 567.66)  and he honors those\n(592.22, 567.66) \n(573.94, 591.36)  live in the presence of the Lord.\n(594.46, 601.3)  A reading from the Letter of St. Paul to the Colossians. now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake and in my flesh I am filling up\n(601.3, 606.74)  what is lacking in the afflictions of Christ on behalf of his body which is\n(606.74, 612.52)  the church of which I am a minister in accordance with God's stewardship given\n(612.52, 619.56)  to me to bring to completion for you the word of God the mystery hidden from ages\n(619.56, 627.86)  ages and from generations past.\n(641.14, 627.86) \n(635.06, 653.22)  Whom God chose to make known\n(654.58, 674.6)  The word of the Lord. Praise to you, O God.\n(674.6, 677.48)  The Lord be with you.\n(677.48, 684.5)  A reading from the Holy Gospel according to Luke.\n(684.5, 686.94)  Jesus entered a village where a woman\n(686.94, 690.74)  whose name was Martha welcomed him.\n(690.74, 693.42)  She had a sister named Mary,\n(693.42, 696.34)  who sat beside the Lord at his feet,\n(696.34, 698.26)  listening to him speak.\n(699.4, 702.22)  Martha, burdened with much serving,\n(702.22, 703.76)  came to him and said,\n(703.76, 706.84)  Lord, do you not care that my sister\n(706.84, 710.84)  has left me by myself to do the serving?\n(710.84, 712.3)  Tell her to help me.\n(713.94, 712.3) \n(716.02, 721.78)  The Lord said to her in reply, Martha, Martha, you are anxious and worried about many things.\n(721.78, 727.58)  There is need of only one thing. Mary has chosen the better part\n(727.58, 733.58)  and it will not be taken from her. The Gospel of the Lord.\n(733.58, 740.58)  Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ.\n(741.22, 740.58) \n(744.6, 749.5)  Some single men in a Bible study group were discussing who would make the better wife when they were discussing this gospel story today.\n(749.5, 754.5)  Martha or Mary? So one fellow says, well I think\n(754.5, 760.18)  Martha would make the better wife. The way to a man's heart is through his stomach.\n(760.18, 765.74)  It sounds like Martha surely knew how to cook and I would love to be married\n(765.74, 771.54)  to a woman like that. So another guy says I think Mary would make the better wife.\n(771.54, 776.22)  She was always so thoughtful and sweet and loving and listening.\n(776.22, 780.18)  I could be very happy married to a woman like Mary.\n(780.18, 785.18)  Finally another fellow settled the argument when he said well\n(785.18, 790.62)  I'd like to be married to both of them. I would like Martha before supper\n(790.62, 796.98)  Mary after supper. I'm not sure that that was the Lord's point in telling the\n(796.98, 802.98)  story but you know what I think he was on the right track because the Lord was\n(802.98, 810.9)  challenging the listeners and us to combine the listening spirit of Mary\n(810.9, 818.42)  with the energetic spirit of Martha. To combine those in our own Christian lives\n(818.42, 825.4)  every day. As we see the gospel story Jesus visits the home of his friends and\n(825.4, 831.64)  we find Mary sitting at his feet listening to his words probably with a\n(831.64, 838.68)  wide-open heart and meanwhile Martha is bustling about preparing the meal\n(838.68, 846.3)  ensuring the Lord is welcomed and fed. It's a scene of contrast, one of rest, one\n(846.3, 854.16)  of motion, one silent, one busy, but both deeply loving. And here's the point of\n(854.16, 859.28)  the Lord's story. The Lord was challenging his listeners not to choose\n(859.28, 868.32)  between them, but to integrate both. He wasn't dismissing Martha's efforts, nor\n(868.32, 875.08)  was he simply praising Mary for idleness. No, he was calling us to something far\n(875.08, 882.3)  deeper, to combine that listening spirit of Mary with the vibrant spirit of\n(882.3, 890.8)  Mather in our own Christian lives. When Jesus says Mary chose the better part, it\n(890.8, 897.28)  was because she recognized the primacy of the Lord's presence in her life. She\n(897.28, 903.64)  knew that just being with the Lord was a gift to her. In a world that prizes\n(903.64, 909.64)  productivity, Mary reminds us that our identity is not rooted in what we do, but\n(909.64, 916.28)  in who we are before God. We all know that we need to recover in our lives\n(916.28, 923.0)  that listening spirit, that listening posture that Mary had. It's hard to\n(923.0, 930.34)  listen in a world that throws us so much noise and daily distractions. How do we\n(930.34, 935.78)  listen better. We do that through our own prayer life, in the reading of Scripture,\n(935.78, 943.02)  and just being still. Do we always need to be doing something, watching something,\n(943.02, 950.38)  drop the phones occasionally, and just listen? To sit at the feet of Jesus and\n(950.38, 958.78)  say speak Lord, your servant is listening. Without this posture of listening, our\n(958.78, 963.78)  Our actions risk becoming empty or anxious like Martha's.\n(964.56, 969.56)  Listening grounds us, gives direction to our doing.\n(971.54, 974.72)  On the other hand, let's not forget Martha.\n(974.72, 979.72)  Her energy, her service, her desire to care for the Lord,\n(980.48, 983.54)  all of this reflects the act of love\n(983.54, 985.48)  that we're all called to live.\n(986.62, 985.48) \n(991.94, 998.62)  The church, for instance, cannot run on contemplation alone. We are called to be the hands and feet of Christ, to feed the hungry, care for the sick,\n(998.62, 1002.3)  visit the lonely, to minister to one another.\n(1002.3, 1007.62)  Martha reminds us that love isn't just spoken, it's done.\n(1007.62, 1011.42)  Faith isn't only felt, it's lived.\n(1011.42, 1019.0)  in her we see the necessity of action also. And so Jesus isn't asking us to be\n(1019.0, 1026.68)  either Mary or Martha, he's inviting us to be both, to live a balanced Christian\n(1026.68, 1036.64)  life where our service flows from our prayer and our prayer depends on service.\n(1036.64, 1042.6)  Imagine starting each day like Mary with the Lord's Word on our lips and then\n(1042.6, 1047.68)  going out like Martha to serve our families, communities, our church, and\n(1047.68, 1054.68)  those we work with. That's the rhythm of Christian discipleship. That is the\n(1054.68, 1061.84)  harmony of the gospel life that God calls each one of us to. Let us not\n(1061.84, 1068.32)  become so busy that we forget to pray, nor so withdrawn in contemplation that\n(1068.32, 1076.12)  we fail to serve. The Saints show us this well. St. Tracer of Calcutta, who began\n(1076.12, 1083.84)  every morning with hours of prayer, and then spent her day in the streets\n(1083.84, 1091.0)  washing the wounds of the poor. She listened like Mary, she served like\n(1091.0, 1101.8)  Mather. So today Jesus invites each of us to that divine balance, to sit and serve,\n(1101.8, 1111.76)  to pray and act, to be Mary and Mather every day. May we welcome like Mary and\n(1111.76, 1118.12)  Martha welcome the Lord not just into our homes but into our hearts and may we\n(1118.12, 1125.48)  rise each morning asking Lord help me to listen with Mary's heart and to serve\n(1125.48, 1129.08)  with Martha's hands.\n(1141.76, 1157.94)  We now profess our faith in God.\n(1157.94, 1165.52)  I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all things visible\n(1165.52, 1167.36)  and invisible.\n(1167.36, 1174.24)  I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, born of the Father before\n(1174.24, 1176.24)  all ages.\n(1176.24, 1183.16)  God from God, light from light, true God from true God, begotten not made, consubstantial\n(1183.16, 1187.12)  with the Father, through him all things were made.\n(1187.12, 1193.96)  For us men and for our salvation he came down from heaven, and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate\n(1193.96, 1201.42)  of the Virgin Mary and became man. For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate,\n(1201.42, 1206.5)  he suffered death and was buried, and rose again on the third day in accordance with\n(1206.5, 1213.26)  the Scriptures. He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father.\n(1213.26, 1218.46)  He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead, and his kingdom will have no\n(1218.46, 1225.02)  end. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from\n(1225.02, 1229.38)  the Father and the Son, who with the Father and the Son is adored and\n(1229.38, 1235.42)  glorified, who has spoken through the prophets. I believe in one holy Catholic\n(1235.42, 1241.14)  and Apostolic Church. I confess one baptism for the forgiveness of sins and\n(1241.14, 1245.78)  I look forward to the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to\n(1245.78, 1252.42)  come, Amen. Let us now place our trust in the Lord as we ask him to hear and answer our prayers.\n(1256.74, 1262.5)  For all who lead the church, may God provide them with the graces they need in their ministry,\n(1263.3, 1266.26)  we pray to the Lord. Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1268.18, 1273.7)  For peace in the Middle East and Ukraine, may all people be healed from the pain and oppression\n(1273.7, 1278.5)  the one they have endured,\n(1302.32, 1278.5) \n(1286.74, 1301.76)  a lasting peace and harmony,\n(1305.76, 1305.86)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1305.76, 1309.1)  We pray that those of us who are strong will always come\n(1309.1, 1312.06)  to the assistance of those who are weak,\n(1312.06, 1315.62)  those who are wealthy to the assistance of the poor,\n(1315.62, 1320.14)  and those who are healthy to the assistance of the sick.\n(1320.14, 1321.78)  We pray to the Lord.\n(1321.78, 1323.54)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1325.14, 1328.54)  For all who have passed away in the light of Christ,\n(1328.54, 1332.3)  especially Michael McCarthy, Paul Reynolds,\n(1332.3, 1337.58)  and Paul Rakauskas for whom\n(1337.84, 1340.88)  this Mass is offered and for all\n(1340.88, 1343.88)  our deceased relatives, friends and parishioners.\n(1343.88, 1346.88)  May the Lord bring them to everlasting life.\n(1346.88, 1348.88)  We pray to the Lord.\n(1348.88, 1351.88)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1351.88, 1355.88)  May the silent prayers in our hearts be lifted up to God,\n(1355.88, 1359.88)  who knows our needs even before we ask.\n(1359.88, 1360.88)  We pray to the Lord.\n(1360.88, 1362.88)  Lord hear our prayer\n(1363.08, 1368.08)  God of mercy and peace you constantly care for all of us hear our prayers\n(1368.08, 1373.56)  Which we offer in confidence to you. We ask them through Christ our Lord\n(1420.88, 1444.28)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through your goodness we have received\n(1444.28, 1449.28)  the bread we offer you, fruit of the earth and work of human hands, it will become for\n(1449.28, 1456.2)  us the bread of life. Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through\n(1456.2, 1460.72)  your goodness we have received the wine we offer you, fruit of the vine and work\n(1460.72, 1466.4)  of human hands. It will become our spiritual drink.\n(1479.28, 1486.44)  Pray, brothers and sisters, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God, the Almighty\n(1486.44, 1489.44)  Father.\n(1489.44, 1502.6)  O God, who in the one perfect sacrifice brought to completion varied offerings of the Law,\n(1502.6, 1508.2)  accept we pray this sacrifice from your faithful servants and make it holy as you bless the\n(1508.2, 1513.72)  gifts of Abel, so that what each has offered to the honor of your majesty may benefit the\n(1513.72, 1518.28)  salvation of all, through Christ our Lord.\n(1518.28, 1527.52)  The Lord be with you, lift up your hearts, let us give thanks to the Lord our God, it\n(1527.52, 1533.08)  is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, always and everywhere to give you\n(1533.08, 1539.6)  thanks, Lord, Holy Father, Almighty and Eternal God, through Christ our Lord. For\n(1539.6, 1544.44)  out of compassion for the waywardness that is ours, He humbled Himself and was\n(1544.44, 1549.52)  born of the Virgin. By the passion of the cross He freed us from unending death,\n(1549.52, 1555.36)  and by rising from the dead He gave us life eternal. And so with angels and\n(1555.36, 1560.28)  archangels we sing the hymn of your glory, as without end we now acclaim.\n(1560.28, 1567.88)  Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts, heaven and earth are full of your glory,\n(1567.88, 1573.66)  Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord,\n(1573.66, 1577.34)  Hosanna in the highest.\n(1578.66, 1584.46)  You are indeed holy, O Lord, the fount of all holiness. Make holy, therefore, these\n(1584.46, 1589.7)  gifts, we pray, by sending down your Spirit upon them like the dewfall, so\n(1589.7, 1595.94)  that they may become for us the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ. At the\n(1595.94, 1601.14)  time he was betrayed and entered willingly into his passion he took bread\n(1601.14, 1607.22)  and giving thanks broke it and gave it to his disciples saying take this all of\n(1607.22, 1614.76)  you and eat of it for this is my body which will be given up for you.\n(1619.7, 1627.5)  In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took the chalice and once more giving thanks,\n(1627.5, 1633.38)  he gave it to his disciples saying, take this, all of you, and drink from it, for this is\n(1633.38, 1638.58)  the chalice of my blood, the blood of the new and eternal covenant, which will be poured\n(1638.58, 1642.2)  out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins.\n(1642.2, 1644.66)  Do this in memory of me.\n(1649.7, 1660.26)  The mystery of faith. When we eat this bread and drink this cup, we proclaim\n(1660.26, 1666.06)  your death, O Lord, until you come again. Therefore, as we celebrate the memorial\n(1666.06, 1670.26)  of his death and resurrection, we offer you, Lord, the bread of life and the\n(1670.26, 1675.18)  chalice of salvation, giving thanks that you have held us worthy to be in your\n(1675.18, 1681.06)  your presence and minister to you humbly we pray that partaking of the body and\n(1681.06, 1686.58)  blood of Christ we may be gathered into one by the Holy Spirit remember Lord\n(1686.58, 1691.46)  your church spread throughout the world and bring her to the fullness of charity\n(1691.46, 1697.74)  together with Leo our Pope and Richard our Bishop and all the clergy remember\n(1697.74, 1701.7)  also our brothers and sisters who have fallen asleep in the hope of the\n(1701.7, 1707.34)  resurrection, and all who have died in your mercy, welcome them into the light\n(1707.34, 1713.26)  of your face. Have mercy on us all, we pray, that with the Blessed Virgin Mary,\n(1713.26, 1719.22)  Mother of God, Saint Joseph, her spouse, with the blessed apostles, Saint Brigid\n(1719.22, 1723.78)  of Kildare, Saint Augustine, and all the saints who have pleased you throughout\n(1723.78, 1728.74)  the ages, that we may merit to be co-heirs to eternal life and may praise\n(1728.74, 1737.06)  and glorify you through your Son Jesus Christ through him and with him and in\n(1737.06, 1742.26)  him Oh God Almighty Father in the unity of the Holy Spirit all glory and honor\n(1742.26, 1751.98)  is yours forever and ever at the Savior's command and formed by divine\n(1751.98, 1759.32)  teaching, we dare to pray now. Our Father, heart in heaven, hallowed be thy name.\n(1759.32, 1766.06)  Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our\n(1766.06, 1771.7)  daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who\n(1771.7, 1778.26)  trespass against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil.\n(1778.26, 1784.64)  deliver us Lord we pray from every evil graciously grant peace in our days but\n(1784.64, 1789.66)  by the help of your mercy we may be always free from sin and safe from all\n(1789.66, 1796.9)  distress as we await the blessed hope in the coming of our Savior Jesus Christ\n(1799.02, 1804.16)  Lord Jesus Christ who said to your apostles peace I leave you my peace I\n(1804.16, 1809.08)  give you look not now on our sins but on the faith of your church and graciously\n(1809.08, 1813.42)  grant her peace and unity in accordance with your will who live and reign\n(1813.42, 1820.34)  forever and ever the peace of the Lord be with you always let's offer each\n(1820.34, 1824.36)  other some sign of Christ's peace\n(1831.16, 1824.36) \n(1838.76, 1845.4)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.

Lamb of God, you take away\n(1845.4, 1850.28)  the sins of the world, grant us peace.\n(1852.28, 1858.78)  Behold the Lamb of God, behold him who takes away the sins of the world, blessed\n(1858.78, 1863.92)  are those called to the Supper of the Lamb. Lord, I am not worthy that you\n(1863.92, 1870.76)  should enter under my roof, but only say the word and my soul shall be healed.\n(2113.4, 2127.32)  Let us pray.\n(2127.32, 2131.98)  Graciously be present to your people, we pray, O Lord, and lead those you have imbued with\n(2131.98, 2136.68)  heavenly mysteries to pass from former ways to newness of life.\n(2136.68, 2139.88)  We ask this through Christ our Lord.\n(2139.88, 2142.36)  The Lord be with you.\n(2142.36, 2147.64)  Almighty God bless you the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit our mass has\n(2147.64, 2153.32)  ended we go in peace have a great week everybody\n(2262.36, 2264.36)  .\n",

We ask this\n(381.78, 388.38)  to our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy\n(388.38, 395.38)  Spirit, one God forever and ever. Amen. Let us now be attentive to God's sacred word.\n(403.86, 395.38) \n(407.5, 413.0)  a reading from the book of Genesis. The Lord appeared to Abraham by the terebinth of Mamre as he sat in the entrance of his\n(413.0, 417.5)  tent while the day was growing harsh.\n(417.5, 422.68)  Looking up, Abraham saw three men standing nearby.\n(422.68, 427.36)  When he saw them, he ran from the entrance of the tent to greet them.\n(427.36, 430.16)  And bowing to the ground, he said,\n(430.16, 437.36)  Sir, if I might ask you this favor, please do not go on past your servant.\n(437.36, 443.04)  Let some water be brought that you may bathe your feet, and then rest yourselves under\n(443.04, 445.32)  the tree.\n(445.32, 450.72)  Now that you have come this close to your servant, let me bring you a little food that\n(450.72, 458.24)  you may refresh yourselves, and afterward you may go on your way.\" The men replied,\n(458.24, 465.48)  very well, do as you have said. Abraham hastened into the tent and told\n(465.48, 472.96)  Sarah, quick, three measures of fine flour, knead it and make rolls. He ran to the\n(472.96, 479.36)  herd, picked out a tender choice steer, and gave it to a servant who quickly\n(479.36, 486.52)  prepared it. Then Abraham got some curds and milk as well as the steer that had\n(486.52, 492.76)  been prepared and set these before the three men and he waited on them under\n(492.76, 500.68)  the tree while they ate. They asked Abraham, where is your wife Sarah? He\n(500.68, 508.04)  replied, there in the tent. One of them said, I will surely return to you about\n(508.04, 516.72)  this time next year, and Sarah will then have a son. The word of the Lord.\n(532.76, 516.72) \n(544.08, 548.08)  He who does justice will live in the presence of the Lord. He who does justice will live\n(548.08, 553.08)  in the presence of the Lord.\n(554.52, 559.52)  One who walks blamelessly and does justice,\n(560.08, 565.08)  who thinks the truth in his heart\n(565.08, 570.08)  and slanders not with his tongue.\n(572.08, 570.08) \n(583.32, 594.08)  He who does justice will live in the presence of the Lord. One who harms not his fellow man, nor takes up a reproach against his neighbor,\n(594.08, 599.52)  by whom the reprobate is despised,\n(599.52, 607.52)  while he honours those who fear the Lord.\n(607.52, 612.08)  He who does justice will live\n(612.08, 619.08)  in the presence of the Lord,\n(619.08, 629.8)  who lends not his money at usury and accepts no bribe against the innocent.\n(630.76, 641.48)  One who does these things shall never be disturbed.\n(642.44, 641.48) \n(653.48, 667.48)  He who does justice will live in the presence of the Lord.\n(653.48, 671.98)  A reading from the letter of St. Paul to the Colossians.\n(671.98, 678.66)  Brothers and sisters, now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh\n(678.66, 684.04)  I am filling up what is lacking in the afflictions of Christ on behalf of his\n(684.04, 689.96)  body, which is the church, of which I am a minister in accordance with God's\n(689.96, 696.28)  stewardship given to me to bring to completion for you the Word of God, the\n(696.28, 703.16)  mystery hidden from ages and from generations past. But now it has been\n(703.16, 709.3)  manifested to his holy ones, to whom God chose to make known the riches of the\n(709.3, 718.0)  glory of this mystery among the Gentiles. It is Christ in you, the hope for glory.\n(718.0, 725.7)  It is he whom we proclaim, admonishing everyone and teaching everyone with all\n(725.7, 730.7)  all wisdom, that we may present everyone perfect in Christ.\n(732.64, 734.14)  The word of the Lord.\n(734.14, 735.64)  Praise be to God.\n(747.02, 751.02)  Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.\n(755.7, 767.7)  Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.\n(767.7, 774.7)  Blessed are they who have kept the word with a generous heart\n(774.7, 781.7)  and yield a harvest through perseverance.\n(781.7, 784.7)  Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.\n(785.7, 792.92)  Hallelujah, Hallelujah.\n(792.92, 794.48)  The Lord be with you.\n(794.48, 800.26)  A reading from the Holy Gospel according to Luke.\n(800.26, 805.14)  Jesus entered a village where a woman whose name was Martha welcomed him.\n(805.14, 811.14)  She had a sister named Mary who sat beside the Lord at his feet listening to him speak.\n(811.14, 814.84)  Martha, burdened with much serving, came to him and said,\n(814.84, 819.3)  Lord, do you not care that my sister\n(819.3, 823.06)  has left me by myself to do the serving?\n(823.06, 824.78)  Tell her to help me.\n(824.78, 829.78)  The Lord said to her in reply, Martha, Martha,\n(829.78, 833.3)  you are anxious and worried about many things.\n(833.3, 836.7)  There is no need of only one thing.\n(836.7, 839.14)  Martha has chosen the better part,\n(839.14, 842.54)  and it will not be taken away from her.\n(842.54, 844.18)  The gospel of the Lord.\n(844.18, 846.82)  Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ.\n(850.98, 853.54)  Turn off the other mic so it won't be scratching.\n(853.54, 855.66)  Oh, what a beautiful reading for today.\n(855.66, 857.26)  It's about all of us.\n(857.26, 860.18)  You know, the contemplative is Mary,\n(860.18, 862.12)  one that's looked for sensitivity\n(862.12, 864.06)  and a deeper prayer life, perhaps.\n(864.06, 867.66)  And Martha, the worker, she was about action.\n(867.66, 870.9)  As a young priest, if you said which one did I choose,\n(870.9, 874.98)  I'd say Martha, she gets things done, you go to her.\n(874.98, 877.18)  And there's so many people in the parish\n(877.18, 879.7)  that are like that, balanced.\n(879.7, 882.62)  Today, the reading is continuing from last week,\n(882.62, 884.98)  the Good Samaritan, and the golden thread\n(884.98, 887.34)  through the readings to come during the summer\n(887.34, 891.06)  is what must I do to inherit eternal life?\n(891.06, 894.02)  Last week, when we talked about the Samaritan,\n(894.02, 896.34)  you know, and the gift of God's healing grace,\n(896.34, 898.88)  that we are the Samaritan, we are the Christ.\n(898.88, 901.16)  And then we look at the story today\n(901.16, 904.54)  about taking place at the dining room table.\n(904.54, 907.54)  Many of the stories that Jesus uses,\n(907.54, 910.44)  the road to Emmaus, the breaking of bread,\n(910.44, 913.28)  Zacchaeus, come down so I can come to your house,\n(913.28, 915.44)  take place within the house.\n(915.44, 918.28)  One of the key things, along with the better part\n(918.28, 922.24)  that I'll get into later on, soon later,\n(922.24, 926.16)  is the fact that what's going on in this house?\n(926.16, 928.16)  Mary is the one that came in\n(928.16, 930.64)  and she heard Christ was in the living room.\n(930.64, 933.92)  And she went and she sat and knelt at his feet.\n(933.92, 937.1)  That was the sign only for men.\n(937.1, 941.36)  Only the men at this time were taught the law in scripture.\n(941.36, 944.16)  And here's Mary coming right in\n(944.16, 946.68)  and taking the posture as a disciple.\n(946.68, 949.84)  The rabbi, meaning Jesus, would be the teacher.\n(949.84, 952.0)  Well, this was counter-cultural.\n(952.0, 953.54)  This never happened.\n(953.54, 956.56)  But Mary was seeking that inner spirit\n(956.56, 958.7)  that she heard from Christ.\n(958.7, 960.9)  Now, Martha is the worker.\n(960.9, 962.88)  She is about many things.\n(962.88, 965.06)  Do you know, many times when you're invited\n(965.06, 967.54)  to someone's house, and particularly a priest,\n(967.54, 969.5)  they'll say, oh, Father Steele,\n(969.5, 972.06)  I wish I had more time to make your favorite meal.\n(972.06, 973.78)  I know you love turkey and stuffing\n(973.78, 976.06)  and squash 24 hours a day.\n(976.06, 979.58)  I said, I do, but don't, oh, I wish, they go on and on.\n(979.58, 984.06)  I said, now listen, I'm not here just to eat.\n(984.06, 985.18)  I want your company.\n(985.18, 986.3)  Now come in the living room.\n(986.3, 988.44)  Oh no, I have to get the dessert.\n(988.44, 990.38)  Come into the living room.\n(990.38, 992.2)  I'm here to be with you.\n(992.2, 994.34)  Nevermind about the food.\n(994.34, 998.1)  Martha is the one you want for doing parish events.\n(998.1, 1001.62)  But she can only do that if she seeks the better part.\n(1001.62, 1005.64)  So Christ is telling both of them in a nice way\n(1005.64, 1007.06)  not to correct.\n(1007.06, 1011.26)  But Mary has chosen this inner spirit that she needs\n(1011.26, 1015.22)  to come into her heart to make her awaken of God's spirit.\n(1015.22, 1019.82)  In his voice, in his posture, in his gentleness,\n(1019.82, 1022.62)  she's getting everything that she needs.\n(1022.62, 1027.02)  So Martha wants that as well, but she's the organizer.\n(1027.02, 1031.18)  And she's very anxious, she's distracted, she's worried.\n(1031.18, 1035.08)  And Jesus is saying in his own way, let go of that.\n(1035.08, 1037.52)  That's why I say you and I have chosen\n(1037.52, 1039.52)  the better part this morning.\n(1039.52, 1042.84)  You come, like St. Ignatius would say, to Mass,\n(1042.84, 1045.72)  and when you're in the pew and the music is playing\n(1045.72, 1048.88)  and you're in that quiet moment even after communion,\n(1048.88, 1051.0)  you're doing what St. Ignatius would say.\n(1051.0, 1054.88)  Take an inventory of look what happened during the week.\n(1054.88, 1058.6)  What was it during the week that I really felt good about?\n(1058.6, 1060.32)  What during the week was something\n(1060.32, 1062.92)  that I think I could have done better?\n(1063.8, 1062.92) \n(1068.8, 1074.04)  When I go back to work or at family events or that cookout later on in the summer, what might I do to change that attitude that seemed to be prevailing in our discussion?\n(1074.04, 1077.4)  And you bring it to Christ saying, how can I do better?\n(1077.4, 1083.0)  And at the end, Saint Ignatius would say, ask him to guide you to the person you long\n(1083.0, 1085.64)  to be, gentleness, kindness, and hope.\n(1085.64, 1091.4)  So today, we see this beautiful history in the scriptures with the Gospel of Luke.\n(1091.4, 1094.4)  Luke is the gospel of woman.\n(1094.4, 1096.9)  For every story there is about a woman,\n(1096.9, 1098.56)  there's a story about a man.\n(1098.56, 1101.12)  Last week it was Zacchaeus, a male.\n(1101.12, 1102.92)  This week it's about Mary.\n(1102.92, 1105.38)  Next week, we take all the things\n(1105.38, 1107.1)  about finding the better part.\n(1107.1, 1110.1)  The better part isn't to be left at the end of the meal.\n(1110.1, 1111.52)  Oh, I'm so exhausted.\n(1111.52, 1114.36)  Well, I have a few minutes to talk to you before you leave.\n(1114.36, 1116.32)  The better part is what you choose.\n(1116.32, 1118.78)  It's not competition.\n(1118.78, 1121.42)  We wanna balance in life as best we can,\n(1121.42, 1123.14)  and that's difficult.\n(1123.14, 1125.34)  This is the balance this morning.\n(1125.34, 1127.58)  It's quiet, you can't talk to someone.\n(1127.58, 1129.64)  You have to be quiet, you have to listen to God.\n(1129.64, 1132.0)  We call Christ into our heart\n(1132.0, 1134.3)  to hear what we need for tomorrow.\n(1134.3, 1138.58)  Now next week, we have another invitation.\n(1138.58, 1141.22)  If the prayer doesn't work that you're using,\n(1141.22, 1143.62)  listen to the greatest prayer that Christ gives us,\n(1143.62, 1144.86)  the Our Father.\n(1144.86, 1149.1)  So next week, we're following that medical therapy\n(1149.1, 1152.3)  that Christ gives us to listen to his heart,\n(1152.3, 1154.92)  to respond with hope, and always knows\n(1154.92, 1157.46)  that we can never fail when we reach out\n(1157.46, 1160.96)  like we do this morning with Mass, the Eucharist.\n(1160.96, 1165.62)  It opens our heart to always choose the better part.\n(1165.62, 1166.46)  Amen.\n(1168.26, 1170.94)  I have the 12 noon, so Father Casey said,\n(1170.94, 1172.5)  don't be too long, amen.\n(1204.86, 1228.86)  For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate.\n(1228.86, 1243.74)  He would come again in glory to judge the living and the dead.\n(1243.74, 1245.78)  His kingdom will have no end.\n(1245.78, 1250.9)  I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father\n(1250.9, 1251.9)  and the Son.\n(1251.9, 1257.26)  But the Father and the Son is adored and glorified, who has spoken through their prophets.\n(1257.26, 1261.06)  I believe in one holy Catholic and apostolic church.\n(1261.06, 1264.34)  I confess one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.\n(1264.34, 1266.46)  I look forward to the resurrection of the dead\n(1266.46, 1269.06)  and the life of the world to come, amen.\n(1269.06, 1271.9)  Ever mindful of God's love for us this beautiful morning,\n(1271.9, 1273.94)  we now place before the altar of Christ\n(1273.94, 1276.1)  our prayer of the faithful.\n(1276.1, 1278.3)  For all who lead the church,\n(1278.3, 1280.74)  may God provide them with the graces they need\n(1280.74, 1283.38)  in their ministry, we pray to the Lord.\n(1283.38, 1285.46)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1285.46, 1288.4)  for peace in the Middle East and Ukraine.\n(1288.4, 1291.48)  May all people be healed from the pain and depression\n(1291.48, 1293.08)  they have endured.\n(1293.08, 1296.16)  And may God provide the leaders the fortitude\n(1296.16, 1301.0)  to secure a lasting peace and harmony for all their people.\n(1301.0, 1302.44)  We pray to the Lord.\n(1302.44, 1304.64)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1304.64, 1307.36)  For those who wonder where God may be calling them\n(1307.36, 1310.2)  on life's journey, may they consider\n(1310.2, 1314.16)  Martha and Mary's life of activity and contemplation\n(1314.16, 1318.4)  in the service of the Lord and find light for their journey,\n(1318.4, 1319.76)  we pray to the Lord.\n(1319.76, 1322.04)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1322.04, 1324.94)  We pray that those of us who are strong\n(1324.94, 1328.96)  will always come to the assistance of those who are weak,\n(1328.96, 1332.88)  those who are wealthy to the assistance of the poor,\n(1332.88, 1336.98)  and those who are healthy to the assistance of the sick.\n(1336.98, 1338.32)  We pray to the Lord.\n(1338.32, 1340.48)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1340.48, 1343.96)  For all who have passed away in the light of Christ,\n(1343.96, 1348.32)  especially Colleen Talent, for whom this Mass is offered,\n(1348.32, 1350.76)  and for all of our deceased relatives,\n(1350.76, 1353.04)  friends, and parishioners.\n(1353.04, 1355.84)  May the Lord bring them to everlasting life,\n(1355.84, 1357.16)  we pray to the Lord.\n(1357.16, 1359.32)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1359.32, 1361.4)  May the silent prayers in our hearts\n(1361.4, 1364.8)  be lifted up to God, who knows our needs,\n(1364.8, 1369.6)  even before we ask, we pray to the Lord.\n(1369.6, 1370.96)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1372.24, 1370.96) \n(1376.68, 1377.68)  Let us pray for any visitors to St. Bridget today and anyone traveling this week for safety and peace.\n(1377.68, 1382.56)  Let us pray this week we help each other choose the better path as we journey forth in Christ's\n(1382.56, 1386.6)  love as we celebrate the Eucharist this morning through Christ our Lord.\n(1386.6, 1387.6)  Amen.\n(1387.6, 1392.08)  Please be seated now for our offertory.\n(1392.08, 1398.0)  Please join in singing our offertory hymn number 458 in the hymnal I Heard the Voice\n(1398.0, 1399.0)  of Jesus.\n(1400.0, 1402.0)  I'm glad you did.\n(1402.0, 1404.0)  It has electrolytes, electrolytes.\n(1412.0, 1418.0)  I heard the voice of Jesus say,\n(1418.0, 1423.0)  come on to me and rest.\n(1423.0, 1427.0)  Lay down, thou weary one,\n(1427.0, 1433.98)  Lay down thy head upon my breast.\n(1433.98, 1444.46)  I came to Jesus as I was, so weary, worn, and sad.\n(1444.46, 1455.94)  I found in Him a resting place, and He has made me glad.\n(1455.94, 1466.42)  I heard the voice of Jesus say, behold, I freely give.\n(1466.42, 1476.9)  The living water, thirsty one, stoop down and drink and live.\n(1476.9, 1487.62)  I came to Jesus, and I drank of that life-giving stream.\n(1487.62, 1501.7)  My thirst was quenched, my soul revived, and now I live in Him.\n(1501.7, 1504.46)  Pray, my brothers and sisters, that this sacrifice\n(1504.46, 1507.18)  may be acceptable to God, the almighty Father.\n(1515.02, 1518.42)  Accept, O Lord, we pray the offerings which we bring\n(1518.42, 1520.46)  from the abundance of your gifts,\n(1520.46, 1523.26)  that through the powerful working of your grace,\n(1523.26, 1526.46)  those most sacred mysteries may sanctify\n(1526.46, 1531.18)  our present way of life and lead us to eternal gladness\n(1531.18, 1533.4)  through Christ our Lord.\n(1533.4, 1536.2)  My friends, the Lord be with you.\n(1536.2, 1538.44)  Lift up your hearts.\n(1538.44, 1541.0)  Let us give thanks to the Lord, our God.\n(1542.3, 1545.48)  It is truly right in just our duty and our salvation,\n(1545.48, 1547.88)  always and everywhere to give you thanks,\n(1547.88, 1550.72)  Lord Holy Father, almighty and eternal God,\n(1550.72, 1552.28)  through Christ our Lord.\n(1552.28, 1555.28)  For out of compassion for the waywardness that is ours,\n(1555.28, 1557.76)  he humbled himself who was born of the Virgin.\n(1557.76, 1559.16)  By the passion of the cross,\n(1559.16, 1560.88)  he freed us from unending death,\n(1560.88, 1564.16)  And by rising from the dead, He gave us life eternal.\n(1564.16, 1566.24)  And so with the angels and archangels,\n(1566.24, 1567.76)  with thrones and dominions,\n(1567.76, 1569.92)  with all the hosts of powers of heaven,\n(1569.92, 1571.8)  we sing the hymn of your glory,\n(1571.8, 1573.84)  as without end we acclaim.\n(1573.84, 1588.34)  Holy, holy, holy, Lord, God of hosts,\n(1588.34, 1597.34)  Heaven and earth are full of your glory.\n(1597.34, 1607.32)  Hosanna in the highest, hosanna in the highest.\n(1607.32, 1616.3)  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.\n(1616.3, 1621.28)  Hosanna in the highest.\n(1621.28, 1624.76)  Hosanna in the highest.\n(1632.72, 1636.4)  You are holy indeed, O Lord, the fount of all holiness.\n(1636.4, 1639.6)  Make holy these gifts, we pray, by sending down your Spirit\n(1639.6, 1642.96)  upon them like the dewfall, that they may become for us\n(1642.96, 1647.4)  the body and blood of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.\n(1647.4, 1649.16)  At the time he was betrayed,\n(1649.16, 1651.94)  entered willingly into his passion,\n(1651.94, 1654.12)  he took bread and giving thanks, broke it,\n(1654.12, 1656.16)  and gave it to his disciples saying,\n(1656.16, 1658.2)  take this, all of you, and eat of it.\n(1658.2, 1662.18)  But this is my body, which will be given up for you.\n(1662.18, 1667.18)  In a similar way, when supper was ended,\n(1672.16, 1667.18) \n(1674.86, 1679.74)  In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took the chalice, once more giving thanks, he gave it to his disciples saying, take this all of you and drink from it, for this is\n(1679.74, 1684.9)  the chalice of my blood, the blood of the new and eternal covenant, which will be poured\n(1684.9, 1689.8)  out for you and for many, for the forgiveness of sins.\n(1689.8, 1693.74)  Do this in memory of me.\n(1693.74, 1721.86)  When we eat this bread and drink this cup, We proclaim your death, O Lord, until you\n(1721.86, 1732.34)  Therefore, as we celebrate the memorial of his death and resurrection, we offer you,\n(1732.34, 1738.3)  Lord, the bread of life and the chalice of salvation, giving thanks that you held us\n(1738.3, 1743.16)  worthy to be in your presence and minister to you.\n(1743.16, 1751.58)  Humbly, we pray that partaking of the body and blood of Christ, we may be gathered into\n(1751.58, 1754.5)  won by the Holy Spirit.\n(1754.5, 1757.42)  Remember, Lord, your church spread throughout the world.\n(1757.42, 1759.18)  Bring her to the fullness of charity,\n(1759.18, 1761.46)  together with your servant, Leo, our Pope,\n(1761.46, 1762.9)  Richard, our Bishop.\n(1762.9, 1764.7)  We pray for the clergy.\n(1764.7, 1767.58)  We pray this day for your servant, Colleen,\n(1767.58, 1770.98)  O Lord, this day whom you call from this world to yourself.\n(1770.98, 1773.62)  Grant that Colleen, who was united with your son\n(1773.62, 1775.06)  in a

For the kingdom, the power, and the glory\n(1883.54, 1889.62)  are yours, now and forever. Lord Jesus Christ, who said to your apostles,\n(1889.62, 1895.62)  Peace I leave you, my peace I give you.

I will hold the Christ's light for you in the nighttime of your fear.\n(2096.16, 2108.16)  I will hold my hand out to you, speak the peace you long to hear.\n(2108.16, 2119.16)  I will weep when you are weeping, when you laugh I'll laugh with you.\n(2119.16, 2131.16)  I will share your joy and sorrow till we've seen this journey through.\n(2131.16, 2142.16)  When we sing to God in heaven, we shall find such harmony.\n(2142.16, 2156.16)  Born of all we've known together, of Christ's love and agony.\n(2161.16, 2190.4)  You alone are worthy to be honored and adored, mercy you have given, kindness you have given,\n(2190.4, 2207.58)  you have shown. Love is you alone. Who of us is sinless in this place? Who of us deserves\n(2207.58, 2218.74)  your saving grace? Who of us is good at all without your blessed love that falls upon\n(2218.74, 2237.1)  our hearts to heal our brokenness you alone are holy you alone are worthy to\n(2237.1, 2248.5)  be honored and adored mercy you have given kindness you have shown love is\n(2248.5, 2252.5)  Is you alone?\n(2278.5, 2281.52)  For our meditation after communion,\n(2283.68, 2287.18)  the beautiful part in today's reflection\n(2287.18, 2290.68)  is what keeps us on God's right path.\n(2290.68, 2293.56)  We don't have to wait to the leftovers\n(2293.56, 2295.88)  when everything is empty and gone.\n(2295.88, 2300.14)  We must constantly choose and seek out the better part.\n(2300.14, 2305.02)  But life, many times, interferes with that invitation\n(2305.02, 2307.96)  because like Martha, we too are obsessed\n(2307.96, 2311.08)  with so many activities in business,\n(2311.08, 2312.64)  we are business-like,\n(2312.64, 2315.76)  a life that's very involved for the right reasons.\n(2315.76, 2318.36)  And yet today, our invitation is to listen\n(2318.36, 2322.32)  to both Martha and Mary with her gift of sensitivity\n(2322.32, 2324.84)  and quiet presence.\n(2324.84, 2329.12)  This week, Jesus calls us today and this week\n(2329.12, 2332.72)  to tend to our heart that needs gentle caring\n(2332.72, 2336.2)  and efficiency of God's grace.\n(2336.2, 2338.04)  O Lord, inspire us this morning\n(2338.04, 2340.36)  through our reflection in our Eucharist\n(2340.36, 2343.32)  that we may seek the seed of life, O Lord,\n(2343.32, 2345.28)  and seek the better part.\n(2345.28, 2346.78)  For when we seek that better part,\n(2346.78, 2351.48)  it always leads to greater joy in God's love.\n(2351.48, 2354.66)  O Lord, we give you thanks for putting in our hearts\n(2354.66, 2358.32)  that invitation this morning to come here at St. Bridget's\n(2358.32, 2360.8)  to be part of the Eucharistic community.\n(2360.8, 2365.12)  O Lord, use us as instruments of your life this week\n(2365.12, 2369.08)  that we may help others choose the better path.\n(2369.08, 2370.72)  Amen.\n(2370.72, 2372.78)  Let us stand now for our closing prayer.\n(2377.12, 2380.16)  We have consumed, O Lord, the divine sacrament,\n(2380.16, 2383.08)  the perpetual memorial of the passion of your Son.\n(2383.08, 2384.88)  Grant, we pray, that this gift,\n(2384.88, 2388.34)  which he himself gave us with love beyond our telling,\n(2388.34, 2392.8)  may profit us for salvation through Christ our Lord.\n(2392.8, 2397.24)  Lord be with you. Let us bow our heads and pray for God's blessings. May the Lord\n(2397.24, 2400.98)  bless you and keep you. May his face shine upon you and be gracious to you.\n(2400.98, 2405.26)  Bless you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen.\n(2405.26, 2409.9)  Our celebration has ended. Let us go in the peace of Christ. Thanks be to God.\n(2409.9, 2413.94)  I already had my visit down at Castle Island. I didn't get a hot dog. It was too\n(2413.94, 2418.78)  early, but have a wonderful day, a wonderful week. Go in the peace of Christ.\n(2418.78, 2423.82)  Thanks be to God. I'll be on time for Gay to Heaven, for sure. Amen.\n(2423.82, 2431.12)  Please join in singing our closing hymn number 195 in the hymnal Go Make of All\n(2431.12, 2435.72)  Disciples, number 195.\n(2448.78, 2462.78)  We hear the call, O Lord, that comes from You, our Father, in Your eternal Word.\n(2462.78, 2471.78)  Inspire our ways of learning through earnest, fervent prayer.\n(2471.78, 2482.78)  And let our daily living reveal you everywhere.\n(2482.78, 2493.78)  Go make of all disciples baptizing in the name of Father,\n(2493.78, 2500.78)  Son, and Spirit, from age to age the same.\n(2500.78, 2512.78)  We call each new disciple to follow you, O Lord, redeeming\n(2512.78, 2519.78)  soul and body by water and the word.\n(2560.78, 2589.84)  an\n",

Then Abraham got some curds and milk, as well as the steer that had been prepared\n(576.5, 583.5)  and set at these before the three men, and he waited on them under the tree while they\n(583.9, 590.9)  ate. They asked Abraham, Where is your wife Sarah? He replied, There in the tent. They\n(595.82, 605.82)  One of them said, I will surely return to you about this time next year, and Sarah will\n(605.82, 609.1)  then have a son.\n(609.1, 611.1)  The word of the Lord.\n(625.82, 641.82)  He who does justice will live in the presence of the Lord.\n(641.82, 653.82)  He who does justice will live in the presence of the Lord.\n(653.82, 659.98)  One who walks blamelessly and does justice,\n(659.98, 665.54)  who thinks the truth in his heart,\n(665.54, 669.5)  and slanders not with his tongue.\n(672.78, 681.06)  He who does justice will live in the presence of the Lord.\n(683.82, 708.82)  Who harms not his fellow man, nor takes up a reproach against his neighbor, by whom the reprobate is despised, while he honors those who fear the Lord.\n(708.82, 720.82)  He who does justice will live in the presence of the Lord,\n(720.82, 732.82)  who lends not his money at usury, and accepts no bribe against the innocent.\n(732.82, 745.82)  One who does these things shall never be disturbed.\n(745.82, 757.82)  He who does justice will live in the presence of the Lord.\n(762.82, 775.82)  A reading from the letter of St. Paul to the Colossians.\n(775.82, 786.16)  Brothers and sisters, now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh\n(786.16, 795.54)  I am filling up what is lacking in the afflictions of Christ on behalf of His body, which is\n(795.54, 804.4)  the Church of which I am the minister, in accordance with God's stewardship given to\n(804.4, 815.12)  me to bring completion for you the Word of God, the mystery hidden from ages and from\n(815.12, 822.12)  generations past, but now it has been manifested to his holy ones, to whom God chose to make\n(825.24, 832.24)  known the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles. It is Christ in you, the\n(835.56, 842.56)  hope for glory. It is he whom we proclaim, admonishing everyone and teaching everyone\n(845.12, 854.56)  with all wisdom, that we may present everyone perfect in Christ. The word of\n(854.56, 857.16)  the Lord.\n(868.88, 857.16) \n(885.16, 891.16)  Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah.\n(891.16, 895.16)  Blessed are they who have kept the word\n(895.16, 901.16)  with a generous heart and yield a harvest\n(901.16, 906.16)  through perseverance.\n(906.16, 914.16)  Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah,\n(914.16, 920.84)  The Lord be with you.\n(920.84, 927.76)  A reading from the Holy Gospel according to Luke.\n(927.76, 934.34)  Jesus entered a village where a woman whose name was Martha welcomed him.\n(934.34, 942.52)  She had a sister named Mary who sat beside the Lord at his feet, listening to him speak.\n(942.52, 946.42)  Martha, burdened with much serving, came to him and said,\n(946.42, 950.92)  Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me by myself\n(950.92, 952.8)  to do the serving?\n(952.8, 954.2)  Tell her to help me.\n(956.2, 961.12)  The Lord said to her in reply, Martha, Martha,\n(961.12, 965.26)  you are anxious and worried about many things.\n(965.26, 967.96)  There is need of only one thing.\n(967.96, 970.92)  Mary has chosen the better part,\n(970.92, 973.42)  and it will not be taken from her.\n(974.48, 976.72)  The gospel of the Lord.\n(983.08, 986.76)  There's a story of some single men in a Bible study group\n(986.76, 989.8)  that were looking at this gospel story\n(989.8, 991.84)  of Martha and Mary today.\n(991.84, 996.84)  And one of them asked if they could discuss a little bit\n(998.32, 996.84) \n(1004.36, 1008.36)  they could discuss a little bit about who would make a better wife, Martha or Mary. And one fellow says, well, I think Martha would make the better wife.\n(1008.36, 1012.08)  The way to a man's heart is through his stomach.\n(1012.08, 1015.24)  It sounds like Martha surely knew how to cook, he said.\n(1015.24, 1018.48)  I would love to be married to a woman like that.\n(1018.48, 1023.68)  So another guy says, I think Mary would make the better wife.\n(1023.68, 1027.4)  She was always so thoughtful and sweet and loving.\n(1027.4, 1031.92)  I could be very happy married to a woman like Mary.\n(1031.92, 1037.06)  Finally another guy says, and probably settles the argument with them, he says, well, I'd\n(1037.06, 1040.0)  like to be married to both of them.\n(1040.0, 1045.14)  I would like Martha before supper and Mary after supper.\n(1045.14, 1050.02)  Not sure that that was the Lord's point in telling the story, but you know what, I think\n(1050.02, 1053.5)  this guy might have been on the right track a little,\n(1053.5, 1057.16)  because the Lord was challenging his listeners\n(1057.16, 1062.16)  and us today to combine the listening spirit of Mary\n(1063.46, 1066.9)  with the dynamic spirit of Martha,\n(1067.9, 1072.9)  to combine those two into our own Christian lives every day.\n(1074.1, 1075.98)  As we see in that gospel story,\n(1075.98, 1078.9)  Jesus visits this home of his friends,\n(1078.9, 1082.5)  and we find Mary sitting at his feet,\n(1082.5, 1086.5)  listening to his words with a wide open heart.\n(1087.62, 1090.14)  Meanwhile, Martha is bustling about,\n(1090.14, 1095.14)  preparing the meal, ensuring the Lord is welcomed and fed.\n(1095.86, 1098.9)  It's a scene of contrast, of course,\n(1098.9, 1103.9)  one of rest, one in motion, one silent and one busy,\n(1105.5, 1107.82)  but both deeply loving.\n(1107.82, 1110.32)  And here's the point of the Lord's story, I think.\n(1110.32, 1112.82)  The Lord was challenging his listeners and us\n(1112.82, 1117.72)  not to choose between them, but to integrate both.\n(1119.36, 1123.12)  He wasn't dismissing Martha's efforts,\n(1123.12, 1127.44)  nor was he simply praising Mary for idleness.\n(1127.44, 1130.88)  No, he was calling us to something far deeper,\n(1130.88, 1134.46)  to combine the listening spirit of Mary\n(1134.46, 1137.06)  with the vibrant spirit of Martha\n(1137.06, 1139.0)  in our own Christian lives.\n(1140.3, 1144.3)  When Jesus says Mary chose the better part,\n(1144.3, 1146.52)  because she recognized, of course,\n(1146.52, 1150.6)  the primacy of the Lord's presence in her life,\n(1150.6, 1154.5)  she knew that just being with the Lord was a gift.\n(1155.68, 1158.44)  In a world that prizes productivity,\n(1158.44, 1161.82)  Mary reminds us that our identity\n(1161.82, 1166.82)  is not rooted in what we do, but in who we are before God.\n(1168.5, 1173.5)  We all know that we need to recover in our lives often\n(1174.9, 1177.74)  that listening posture.\n(1177.74, 1182.74)  It's hard to listen in a world that throws us so much noise\n(1182.86, 1187.28)  and daily distractions, and how do we listen better?\n(1187.28, 1190.78)  We do that through our prayer life hopefully,\n(1190.78, 1195.32)  maybe in the reading of scripture, or just being still.\n(1196.66, 1200.54)  We always need to be doing something, watching something.\n(1200.54, 1204.44)  Drop the phones occasionally and just listen.\n(1204.44, 1207.1)  To sit at the feet of Jesus and say,\n(1207.1, 1210.66)  speak Lord, your servant is listening.\n(1211.74, 1213.9)  Without this posture of listening,\n(1213.9, 1218.9)  our actions risk becoming empty or anxious like mothers.\n(1220.32, 1218.9) \n(1223.9, 1226.7)  listening grounds us, it gives direction to our doing.\n(1229.0, 1230.34)  On the other hand, let's not forget Martha,\n(1235.34, 1236.02)  her energy, her service, her desire to care for Jesus.\n(1239.06, 1240.58)  All of this reflects the act of love that we're called to live.\n(1242.28, 1246.62)  For instance, the church cannot run on contemplation alone.\n(1246.62, 1249.18)  We are called to be the hands and feet of Christ,\n(1249.18, 1251.78)  to feed the hungry, to care for the sick\n(1251.78, 1254.74)  and visit the lonely, to minister to one another.\n(1255.66, 1259.18)  So Martha reminds us that love isn't just spoken,\n(1259.18, 1260.62)  it's done.\n(1260.62, 1263.74)  Faith isn't only felt, it's lived.\n(1264.78, 1268.66)  And in her we see the necessity of action also.\n(1269.78, 1274.78)  And so Jesus isn't asking us to be either Mary or Martha.\n(1275.42, 1274.78) \n(1283.2, 1291.16)  He's inviting us to be both, to live a balanced Christian life where our service flows from our prayer, and our prayer deepens through our service.\n(1291.16, 1299.84)  Imagine starting each day, all of us like Mary, with the Lord's words on our lips,\n(1299.84, 1308.8)  And then going out like Martha to serve, to serve our families, our communities, our church,\n(1308.8, 1311.52)  our workplace.\n(1311.52, 1316.02)  That is the rhythm of good discipleship.\n(1316.02, 1322.06)  That is the harmony of the Gospel life that God calls each one of us to.\n(1322.06, 1328.68)  So let's not become so busy that we forget to pray, nor so withdrawn in contemplation\n(1328.68, 1332.22)  that we failed to serve.\n(1332.22, 1338.74)  The saints always show us so well, and I think of St. Teresa of Calcutta, who began every\n(1338.74, 1346.44)  morning with hours of prayer and then spent her days on the streets of Calcutta, washing\n(1346.44, 1349.42)  the wounds of the poor.\n(1349.42, 1352.58)  She listened like Mary.\n(1352.58, 1356.48)  She served like Martha.\n(1356.48, 1365.86)  So today Jesus invites each of us to that divine balance, to sit and serve, to pray\n(1365.86, 1371.48)  and act, to be Mary and Martha every day.\n(1371.48, 1377.24)  May we welcome like Mary and Martha, welcome the Lord, not just into our homes, but into\n(1377.24, 1379.62)  our hearts.\n(1379.62, 1382.98)  may we rise each morning asking,\n(1382.98, 1387.62)  Lord, help me to listen with Mary's heart\n(1387.62, 1390.34)  and serve with Martha's hands.\n(1409.62, 1428.14)  We now profess our faith in God.\n(1428.14, 1435.4)  I believe in one God, the Father almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all things visible\n(1435.4, 1437.14)  and invisible.\n(1437.14, 1443.86)  I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, born of the Father before\n(1443.86, 1451.42)  all ages, God from God, light from light, true God from true God, begotten, not made,\n(1451.42, 1456.1)  consubstantial with the Father, through him all things were made.\n(1456.1, 1462.34)  For us men and for our salvation he came down from heaven, and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate\n(1462.34, 1465.7)  of the Virgin Mary and became man.\n(1465.7, 1469.3)  For our sake He was crucified under Pontius Pilate,\n(1469.3, 1471.42)  He suffered death and was buried,\n(1471.42, 1473.22)  and rose again on the third day\n(1473.22, 1475.58)  in accordance with the Scriptures.\n(1475.58, 1477.14)  He ascended into heaven\n(1477.14, 1480.02)  and is seated at the right hand of the Father.\n(1480.02, 1483.74)  He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead\n(1483.74, 1486.22)  and His kingdom will have no end.\n(1486.22, 1490.18)  I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,\n(1490.18, 1492.78)  who proceeds from the Father and the Son,\n(1492.78, 1496.14)  who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified,\n(1496.14, 1498.58)  who has spoken through the prophets.\n(1498.58, 1502.42)  I believe in one holy catholic and apostolic church.\n(1502.42, 1506.22)  I confess one baptism for the forgiveness of sins,\n(1506.22, 1509.14)  and I look forward to the resurrection of the dead\n(1509.14, 1512.62)  and the life of the world to come, amen.\n(1512.62, 1515.14)  Let us now praise our trust in the Lord\n(1515.14, 1518.72)  as we ask him to hear and answer our prayers this day.\n(1521.06, 1518.72) \n(1529.68, 1531.2)  For all who lead the Church, may God provide them with the graces they need in their ministry. We pray to the Lord.\n(1531.2, 1533.2)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1533.2, 1539.68)  For peace in the Middle East and Ukraine, may all people be healed from the pain and\n(1539.68, 1547.52)  oppression they have endured, and may God provide the leaders the fortitude to secure\n(1547.52, 1554.52)  a lasting peace and harmony for all their people, we pray to the Lord.\n(1554.52, 1557.12)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1557.12, 1564.92)  For those who wonder where God may be calling them on life's journey, may they consider\n(1564.92, 1574.28)  Martha and Mary's life of activity and contemplation in the service of the Lord and find their\n(1574.28, 1576.28)  way in their journey.\n(1576.28, 1587.16)  We pray to the Lord that those of us who are strong will always come to the assistance\n(1587.16, 1596.2)  of those who are weak, those who are wealthy to the assistance of the poor, and those who\n(1596.2, 1601.3)  are healthy to the assistance of the sick.\n(1601.3, 1607.28)  We pray to the Lord, Lord hear our prayer, for all who have passed away in the light\n(1607.28, 1615.28)  of Christ, especially Colin McGrath, for whom this Mass is offered, and for all our deceased\n(1615.28, 1621.84)  relatives, friends, and parishioners, may the Lord bring them everlasting life.\n(1621.84, 1629.3)  We pray to the Lord, Lord hear our prayer, may the silent prayers in our hearts be lifted\n(1629.3, 1637.56)  up to God, who knows our needs even before we ask.\n(1637.56, 1641.7)  We pray to the Lord, Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1641.7, 1645.72)  God of mercy and peace, you constantly care for all of us.\n(1645.72, 1649.2)  Hear our prayers, which we offer in confidence to you.\n(1649.2, 1655.18)  We ask them through Christ our Lord.\n(1655.18, 1660.82)  shown in singing our offertory hymn number 458 in the hymnal I heard the\n(1660.82, 1665.82)  voice of Jesus number 458\n(1674.94, 1665.82) \n(1692.28, 1697.68)  I heard the voice of Jesus say, come unto me and rest. Lay down the weary one, lay down thy head upon my breast.\n(1697.68, 1708.44)  I came to Jesus as I was, so weary, worn, and sad.\n(1708.44, 1719.64)  I found in him a resting place, and he has made me glad.\n(1719.64, 1730.46)  I heard the voice of Jesus say, behold, I freely give.\n(1730.46, 1741.26)  The living water, thirsty one, stoop down and drink and live.\n(1741.26, 1751.78)  I came to Jesus, and I drank of that life-giving stream.\n(1751.78, 1766.7)  My thirst was quenched, my soul revived, and now I live in Him.\n(1766.7, 1770.3)  Pray, brothers and sisters, that my sacrifice and yours\n(1770.3, 1773.6)  may be acceptable to God, the almighty Father.\n(1782.4, 1785.2)  O God, who in the one perfect sacrifice\n(1785.2, 1788.88)  brought to completion varied offerings of the law,\n(1788.88, 1793.28)  accept, we pray, this sacrifice from your faithful servants\n(1793.28, 1796.6)  and make it holy as you bless the gifts of evil\n(1796.6, 1799.04)  so that what each has offered to the honor\n(1799.04, 1803.24)  of your majesty may benefit the salvation of all\n(1803.24, 1805.6)  through Christ our Lord.\n(1805.6, 1807.1)  The Lord be with you.\n(1807.98, 1809.6)  Lift up your hearts.\n(1810.68, 1813.28)  Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.\n(1814.64, 1818.6)  It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,\n(1818.6, 1820.96)  always and everywhere to give you thanks,\n(1820.96, 1824.32)  Lord, Holy Father, almighty and eternal God,\n(1824.32, 1826.7)  through Christ our Lord.\n(1826.7, 1828.94)  For out of compassion, for the way witness\n(1828.94, 1833.74)  that is ours, He humbled Himself and was born of the virgin.\n(1833.74, 1835.3)  By the passion of the cross,\n(1835.3, 1837.7)  He freed us from unending death,\n(1837.7, 1841.96)  and by rising from the dead, He gave us life eternal.\n(1841.96, 1843.88)  And so with angels and archangels,\n(1843.88, 1846.3)  we sing the hymn of your glory,\n(1846.3, 1848.76)  as without end we now acclaim.\n(1848.76, 1869.76)  Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Hosts Heaven and earth are full of your glory.\n(1869.76, 1877.76)  Hosanna in the highest, Hosanna in the highest.\n(1877.76, 1891.76)  Hosanna in the highest, Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.\n(1891.76, 1904.76)  Hosanna in the highest, Hosanna in the highest.\n(1907.76, 1911.76)  You are holy indeed, O Lord, the fount of all holiness.\n(1911.76, 1915.76)  Make holy therefore these gifts, we pray,\n(1915.76, 1919.76)  by sending down your Spirit upon them like the dewfall,\n(1919.76, 1924.76)  so that they may become for us the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.\n(1924.76, 1929.76)  At the time he was betrayed and entered willingly into his passion,\n(1929.76, 1934.76)  he took bread and, giving thanks, broke it and gave it to his disciples,\n(1934.76, 1942.76)  saying, Take this, all of you, and eat of it, for this is My body which will be given up for you.\n(1951.76, 1956.76)  In a similar way, when supper was ended, He took the chalice, and once more giving thanks,\n(1956.76, 1962.76)  He gave it to His disciples, saying, Take this, all of you, and drink from it,\n(1962.76, 1968.12)  For this is the chalice of my blood, the blood of the new and eternal covenant which will\n(1968.12, 1972.92)  be poured out for you and for many, for the forgiveness of sins.\n(1972.92, 1985.16)  Do this in memory of me.\n(1985.16, 1992.16)  the mystery of faith.\n(1993.46, 1997.8)  When we eat this bread\n(1997.8, 2002.44)  and drink this cup,\n(2002.44, 2007.2)  we proclaim your death, O Lord,\n(2007.2, 2014.2)  until you come again.\n(2015.16, 2019.88)  Therefore, as we celebrate the memorial of his death and resurrection, we offer you,\n(2019.88, 2023.0)  Lord, the bread of life and the chalice of salvation,\n(2023.72, 2029.24)  giving thanks that you have held us worthy to be in your presence and minister to you.\n(2030.04, 2034.2)  Humbly we pray that, partaking of the body and blood of Christ,\n(2034.2, 2037.16)  we may be gathered into one by the Holy Spirit.\n(2038.04, 2044.44)  Remember, Lord, your Church spread throughout the world and bring her to the fullness of charity,\n(2044.44, 2048.76)  together with Leo, our Pope, and Richard, our Bishop, and all the clergy.\n(2050.04, 2056.04)  Remember also our brothers and sisters who have fallen asleep in the hope of the resurrection,\n(2056.68, 2061.96)  and all who have died in your mercy.

Luke is known for writing about men and women. For every story there's about a\n(392.6, 397.0)  man like last week, the Good Samaritan. There's a story this week about Martha and\n(397.0, 401.92)  Mary. And so he's most loved by women of the church because he's very\n(401.92, 405.76)  sensitive. And we see that, believe it or not, in the reading today about Martha\n(405.76, 409.56)  and Mary. In the name of the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit, amen. The Lord be\n(409.56, 414.88)  with you. As we begin today, one of the best gifts about finding, you know, the\n(414.88, 419.28)  better part of life, that's the theme in the Gospel, you and I have chosen that\n(419.28, 424.52)  already because we're here. We've chosen the better part of the day to be here in\n(424.52, 428.68)  prayer, the Eucharist, and the celebration of Mass that nurtures us in our\n(428.68, 433.76)  activities, our vision, and our daily work. Let us call to mind our desire for God's\n(433.76, 441.1)  forgiveness and love for us. Lord have mercy. Christ have mercy. Lord have mercy.\n(441.1, 446.3)  May Almighty God have mercy on us. May Lord forgive us our sins and bring us to\n(446.3, 451.48)  everlasting life. Let us recite the Gloria together. Glory to God in the\n(451.48, 456.92)  highest, on earth peace to people of goodwill. We praise you. We bless you. We\n(456.92, 462.36)  adore you. We glorify you. We give you thanks for your great glory. God God\n(462.36, 467.64)  Heavenly King, O God Almighty Father, Lord Jesus Christ, only the God and the Son,\n(467.64, 473.2)  Lord God, Lamb of God, Son of the Father, you take away the sins of the world, have\n(473.2, 477.68)  mercy on us, you take away the sins of the world, receive our prayer, you are\n(477.68, 481.28)  seated at the right hand of the Father, have mercy on us, for you alone are the\n(481.28, 486.2)  Holy One, you alone are the Lord, you alone are the Most High, Jesus Christ, with the\n(486.2, 489.72)  Holy Spirit, in the glory of God the Father, amen.\n(489.72, 495.72)  Loving God, as we celebrate our Eucharist day, we offer our mass in a special way today.\n(495.72, 499.72)  We pray for John Cog Fallon as we pray.\n(499.72, 504.72)  O God, protector of those who hope in you, without whom nothing has firm foundation,\n(504.72, 509.72)  nothing is holy, bestow in abundance your mercy upon us,\n(509.72, 516.72)  and grant that with you as our ruler and guide we may use the good things that pass\n(516.72, 519.98)  in such a way as to hold fast even now\n(519.98, 521.94)  to those that ever endure.\n(521.94, 524.7)  To our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\n(524.7, 526.7)  who lives and reigns with you\n(526.7, 530.3)  in the unity of the Holy Spirit.\n(530.3, 534.62)  One God, forever and ever, amen.\n(534.62, 536.54)  Please be seated, let us now be attentive\n(536.54, 537.86)  to God's sacred word.\n(543.46, 537.86) \n(546.98, 553.34)  A reading from the book of Genesis. The Lord appeared to Abraham by the terebinth of Mamre as he sat in the entrance of his\n(553.34, 557.76)  tent while the day was growing hot.\n(557.76, 562.8)  Looking up, Abraham saw three men standing nearby.\n(562.8, 568.4)  When he saw them, he ran from the entrance of the tent to greet them, and bowing to the\n(568.4, 577.56)  ground he said, Sir, if I may ask you this favor, please do not go on past your servant.\n(577.56, 583.08)  Let some water be brought, that you may bathe your feet, and then rest yourselves under\n(583.08, 584.96)  the tree.\n(584.96, 590.56)  Now that you have come this close to your servant, let me bring you a little food, that\n(590.56, 596.28)  you may refresh yourselves, and afterwards you may go on your way.\"\n(596.28, 602.68)  The men replied, very well, do as you have said.\n(602.68, 609.72)  Abraham hastened into the tent and told Sarah, quick, three measures of fine flour, knead\n(609.72, 612.4)  it and make rolls.\n(612.4, 619.12)  He ran to the herd, picked out a tender choice steer, and gave it to a servant who quickly\n(619.12, 627.16)  prepared it. Then Abraham got some curds and milk, as well as the steer that had been prepared,\n(627.16, 634.68)  and set these before the three men, and he waited on them under the tree while they ate.\n(634.68, 642.36)  They asked Abraham, where is your wife Sarah? He replied, there in the tent. One of them\n(642.36, 651.08)  said I will surely return to you about this time next year and Sara will then have a son.\n(651.08, 653.08)  The word of the Lord.\n(672.36, 682.36)  He who does justice will live in the presence of the Lord.\n(682.36, 693.36)  He who does justice will live in the presence of the Lord.\n(693.36, 699.36)  One who walks blamelessly and does justice,\n(699.36, 713.2)  thinks the truth in his heart and slanders not with his tongue. He who does\n(713.2, 729.28)  justice will live in the presence of the Lord who harms not his fellow man nor\n(729.28, 740.88)  takes up a reproach against his neighbor by whom the reprobate is despised while\n(740.88, 748.88)  while he honors those who fear the Lord.\n(748.88, 760.88)  He who does justice will live in the presence of the Lord,\n(760.88, 766.88)  who lends not his money at usury\n(766.88, 772.78)  and accepts no bribe against the innocent.\n(772.78, 785.78)  One who does these things shall never be disturbed.\n(785.78, 794.82)  He who does justice will live in the presence of the Lord.\n(812.42, 794.82) \n(816.68, 823.96)  A reading from the Letter of St. Paul to the Colossians. Brothers and sisters, now I rejoice in my suffering for your sake, and in my flesh I\n(823.96, 831.28)  I am filling up what is lacking in the affliction of Christ on behalf of his body, which is\n(831.28, 839.56)  the church of which I am a minister, in accordance with God's stewardship given to me, to bring\n(839.56, 846.96)  to completion for you the word of God, the mystery hidden from ages and from generations\n(846.96, 849.22)  past.\n(849.22, 855.5)  But now it has been manifested to his holy ones, to whom God chose to make known the\n(855.5, 860.38)  riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles.\n(860.38, 865.8)  It is Christ in you, the hope for glory.\n(865.8, 874.3)  It is he whom we proclaim, admonishing everyone and teaching everyone with all wisdom, that\n(874.3, 878.86)  we may present everyone perfect in Christ.\n(878.86, 879.86)  the word of the lord.\n(879.86, 880.86)  Thanks be to God.\n(880.86, 881.86)  Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.\n(881.86, 882.86)  Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.\n(882.86, 883.86)  Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.\n(883.86, 884.86)  Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.\n(884.86, 885.86)  Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.\n(885.86, 886.86)  Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.\n(886.86, 887.86)  Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.\n(887.86, 888.86)  Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.\n(888.86, 889.86)  Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.\n(889.86, 890.86)  Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.\n(890.86, 891.86)  Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.\n(891.86, 892.86)  Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.\n(892.86, 893.86)  Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.\n(893.86, 894.86)  Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.\n(894.86, 895.86)  Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.\n(895.86, 896.86)  Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.\n(896.86, 897.86)  Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.\n(897.86, 898.86)  Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.\n(898.86, 899.86)  Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.\n(899.86, 900.86)  Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.\n(900.86, 901.86)  Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.\n(901.86, 902.86)  Hallelujah, hallelujah,

Hallelujah, hallelujah.\n(914.78, 921.58)  Blessed are they who have kept the word with a generous heart\n(921.58, 928.58)  and yield a harvest through perseverance.\n(928.58, 933.58)  Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.\n(940.38, 943.34)  My friends, the Lord be with you.\n(943.34, 948.1)  A reading from the Holy Gospel according to Luke.\n(948.1, 950.82)  Jesus entered a village where a woman whose name\n(950.82, 952.86)  was Martha welcomed him.\n(952.86, 957.5)  She had a sister named Mary who sat beside the Lord at his feet\n(957.5, 959.98)  listening to him speak.\n(959.98, 964.22)  Martha, burdened with much serving, came to him and said,\n(964.22, 968.22)  Lord, do you not care that my sister\n(968.22, 971.38)  has left me by myself to do the serving?\n(971.38, 973.14)  Tell her to help me.\n(973.14, 978.1)  The Lord said to her in reply, Martha, Martha,\n(978.1, 981.66)  you are anxious and worried about many things.\n(981.66, 984.3)  There is need for only one thing.\n(984.3, 988.34)  Mary has chosen the better part,\n(988.34, 991.0)  and it will not be taken from her.\n(991.0, 995.04)  The Gospel of the Lord, praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ.\n(996.26, 998.88)  Today, as we celebrate, we continue, like I said,\n(998.88, 1001.54)  the last several weeks about hospitality,\n(1001.54, 1003.72)  because we heard about Zacchaeus and the tree,\n(1003.72, 1007.52)  we heard about the road to Emmaus, and the good Samaritan.\n(1007.52, 1009.96)  And the golden thread through those readings is,\n(1009.96, 1013.24)  what must I do to reach eternal life?\n(1013.24, 1017.52)  So that's the key foundation of the readings from Luke.\n(1017.52, 1019.68)  I was blessed when I was a young priest\n(1019.68, 1021.2)  after six years of the parish\n(1021.2, 1022.78)  to be sent to graduate school\n(1022.78, 1025.56)  for four years on scripture and spirituality\n(1025.56, 1028.88)  at the University of San Francisco run by the Jesuits.\n(1028.88, 1032.4)  And when I was there, I had a wonderful teacher,\n(1032.4, 1034.08)  Father Eugene LaVerdiere.\n(1034.08, 1036.12)  I didn't know how gifted he was,\n(1036.12, 1037.52)  but for the church and study,\n(1037.52, 1040.26)  this is called the Jerome Biblical Commentary.\n(1040.26, 1044.32)  that has in-depth line about every scripture passage\n(1044.32, 1045.56)  in the Bible.\n(1045.56, 1049.34)  And he wrote the whole section on Luke's gospel.\n(1049.34, 1051.42)  And I never knew that till I came back to Boston\n(1051.42, 1052.64)  the first summer, and they said,\n(1052.64, 1055.36)  you had Eugene the Verde, yes, he was wonderful.\n(1055.36, 1056.52)  One of the things he said was,\n(1056.52, 1060.36)  remember in the scriptures, Jesus is always dining.\n(1060.36, 1062.0)  He liked to eat.\n(1062.0, 1063.16)  Why did he like to eat?\n(1063.16, 1066.26)  Because it was about conversation, relationships.\n(1066.26, 1069.28)  As a early priest in ministry,\n(1069.28, 1070.92)  People would invite me to their homes.\n(1070.92, 1075.52)  For 12 years I was in Wakefield and then 15 in Marblehead\n(1075.52, 1078.12)  and then in the education office for many years.\n(1078.12, 1079.72)  Some people would invite you and they'd say,\n(1079.72, 1080.56)  what do you want?\n(1080.56, 1081.5)  I'd say, oh, anything's fine.\n(1081.5, 1083.58)  Well, after someone served liver,\n(1083.58, 1085.92)  I said, I'm gonna tell them what I like.\n(1085.92, 1088.04)  Turkey, I love turkey.\n(1088.04, 1090.36)  And then people would come to visit me in Marblehead\n(1090.36, 1093.56)  my 15 years and I'd bring you to the landing restaurant\n(1093.56, 1096.0)  and they said, oh, I'm so looking forward to clams.\n(1096.0, 1098.82)  I said, me too, we don't have any clams today.\n(1098.82, 1101.38)  So people, many times we're disappointed,\n(1101.38, 1106.16)  but today it's not about serving at the table.\n(1106.16, 1107.74)  It's not about the meal.\n(1107.74, 1111.02)  It's about the relationship that we enter into.\n(1111.02, 1113.0)  And I'd say to people, you know, they'd say,\n(1113.0, 1114.3)  oh, I knew you liked turkey.\n(1114.3, 1116.74)  Mary Smith told me that and Helen Ryan.\n(1116.74, 1119.02)  I said, oh, God, I shouldn't have said anything.\n(1119.02, 1120.3)  Anything's fine.\n(1120.3, 1121.64)  Oh, I wish I could have done the turkey.\n(1121.64, 1125.18)  I said, I'm here for our relationship\n(1125.18, 1127.06)  so we can spend time together,\n(1127.06, 1128.9)  not pick the turkey apart.\n(1128.9, 1131.02)  So today, this is the foundation.\n(1131.02, 1134.58)  But what's happening here, in the early church,\n(1134.58, 1138.62)  the only people that were educated were men.\n(1138.62, 1141.7)  They were taught the law, and they were taught scripture.\n(1141.7, 1145.0)  And they would come into someone's dwelling,\n(1145.0, 1146.64)  and they would sit on the floor,\n(1146.64, 1150.74)  and the master, the rabbi, and Jesus the rabbi, would teach.\n(1150.74, 1153.1)  Well, here we have in this, and I never knew this,\n(1153.1, 1155.94)  after six years as a priest, I didn't hear any of this\n(1155.94, 1159.14)  until I went to graduate school with Father Eugene LaVerdiere.\n(1159.14, 1161.3)  He'd say, does anyone know what's taking place here\n(1161.3, 1163.42)  in the dining, the living room?\n(1163.42, 1165.5)  And we, well, no.\n(1165.5, 1167.7)  So he'd say, this is what's happening.\n(1167.7, 1171.38)  Martha is upset that she has all this work.\n(1171.38, 1174.22)  But deep down, she's very upset with Mary\n(1174.22, 1178.7)  because she had the nerve to go into the living room\n(1178.7, 1183.46)  and sit at the feet of Jesus, the teacher.\n(1183.46, 1185.16)  That was unheard of.\n(1185.26, 1188.56)  Only men went and were educated.\n(1188.66, 1191.0)  And here, Jesus is inviting them both.\n(1191.1, 1192.44)  It's counter-cultural.\n(1192.54, 1195.64)  It tells us that everyone with their gifts\n(1195.74, 1198.74)  is welcome in the community of faith.\n(1198.84, 1201.18)  Everyone, the good Samaritan, when\n(1201.28, 1203.34)  he hears the poor robber that was injured,\n(1203.44, 1205.98)  the theme was the Samaritan was Christ,\n(1206.08, 1209.96)  and that everyone, no matter who they are,\n(1210.06, 1211.62)  is welcome into God's kingdom.\n(1211.72, 1211.62) \n(1214.16, 1214.26)  Samaritan, or anyone who's despised.\n(1217.06, 1217.16)  So here we have, what's the better part?\n(1219.3, 1219.4)  Well, the better part is in our activity,\n(1222.0, 1222.1)  we are very, very busy and anxious.\n(1224.64, 1224.74)  And Jesus recognized this in poor Martha.\n(1226.48, 1226.58)  You know, I like the line where it says,\n(1230.38, 1230.48)  we don't leave everything to the end of the meal.\n(1232.78, 1232.88)  We pick the better part from the beginning.\n(1236.28, 1236.38)  And so the better part was entering into a relationship\n(1237.68, 1237.78)  with Jesus.\n(1240.02, 1240.12)  She heard within his voice something\n(1240.02, 1244.06)  that was soothing and very, very enriching.\n(1244.16, 1247.9)  And so she's known as the contemplative,\n(1248.0, 1250.76)  and Martha is known as a person of action.\n(1250.86, 1256.34)  Now, as a priest for 48 years, I want Martha on my team.\n(1256.44, 1258.54)  I want a worker.\n(1258.64, 1260.94)  People like Martha will do anything.\n(1261.04, 1264.54)  But Jesus is saying today that we need a balance in life.\n(1264.64, 1266.72)  We're not pitting one against the other.\n(1266.82, 1266.72) \n(1271.22, 1271.32)  We need to make room within our heart for that spirituality\n(1273.32, 1273.42)  to choose the better part.\n(1277.2, 1277.3)  You and I already this morning have chosen the better part.\n(1279.56, 1279.66)  Now, before I came here to South Boston,\n(1281.46, 1281.56)  I almost didn't choose the better part.\n(1283.46, 1283.56)  I went down to Castle Island.\n(1286.84, 1286.94)  No hot dogs at 8.30 in the morning.\n(1289.44, 1289.54)  So I was hungry, but I'll wait till later.\n(1294.44, 1294.54)  But the better part was really celebrating mass with you\n(1294.44, 1298.38)  at 1030 in St. Bridgetson here at Gate of Heaven.\n(1298.38, 1300.84)  But what is it that you search for in your life\n(1300.84, 1303.0)  to make things more spiritual?\n(1303.0, 1304.68)  It's not competition.\n(1304.68, 1308.8)  Martha had the right idea, but she finally, perhaps,\n(1308.8, 1312.64)  realized that Jesus was there to be with them.\n(1312.64, 1315.34)  Father Eugene LaBridia said that, you know what takes place?\n(1315.34, 1316.92)  It doesn't say this in the scripture.\n(1316.92, 1318.8)  You know what takes place at the end?\n(1318.8, 1321.28)  He said, what should have taken place in the writing?\n(1321.28, 1322.2)  I said, what?\n(1322.2, 1323.16)  A class would say, what?\n(1323.16, 1329.48)  He said, I think that Jesus got up after encouraging Martha to come in, and he said to her, you\n(1329.48, 1332.52)  are anxious and worried and distracted about many things.\n(1332.52, 1333.52)  You don't need to be.\n(1333.52, 1335.94)  Come here and sit.\n(1335.94, 1341.56)  He said that I think all three of them went to the dining room table and set the table\n(1341.56, 1342.56)  together.\n(1342.56, 1343.96)  Now that's harmony.\n(1343.96, 1348.78)  So today, take inventory, thank God that you've chosen the better part today.\n(1348.78, 1352.32)  The Eucharist will make everything different this week.\n(1352.32, 1355.0)  St. Ignatius has a wonderful reflection.\n(1355.0, 1356.68)  He calls it the Examen.\n(1356.68, 1359.4)  Try this tonight before you go to bed\n(1359.4, 1361.32)  or when you're trying to get to sleep.\n(1361.32, 1365.24)  He says take an inventory of your life this week.\n(1365.24, 1367.8)  It's Sunday, you're going to work Monday.\n(1367.8, 1369.72)  What last week was something\n(1369.72, 1371.84)  that you really were glad that happened?\n(1371.84, 1373.72)  It might be with a boss or a colleague\n(1373.72, 1376.08)  or some type of networking situation\n(1376.08, 1379.08)  or maybe another course you're taking.\n(1379.08, 1380.16)  What enriched you?\n(1381.04, 1380.16) \n(1385.16, 1392.16)  What was something that you had to do that you didn't want to do? You had to correct someone. What language did you use? If you have to do this again this week, Ignatius would say,\n(1392.16, 1397.16)  what would you do different in a situation this week? What would you do differently?\n(1397.16, 1402.16)  And then he'd say, ask God for the strength to recognize what you need.\n(1402.16, 1407.16)  Sometimes we're so busy from one thing to another, we don't look around to say,\n(1407.16, 1410.44)  to say, you know, I have to pay attention to this.\n(1410.54, 1413.2)  I'm doing all this work, and I'm not having fun.\n(1413.3, 1414.74)  You know, I meet some people that say,\n(1414.84, 1417.14)  I finally met someone, Father Steele.\n(1417.24, 1418.58)  I've been waiting for three years,\n(1418.68, 1421.28)  and I finally found someone I really like.\n(1421.38, 1423.32)  I said, do you think it's going to go anywhere?\n(1423.42, 1424.88)  She said, I don't care.\n(1424.98, 1427.42)  I'm just enjoying the relationship.\n(1427.52, 1429.52)  So Christ is here today.\n(1429.62, 1431.96)  Let me love you the way you are.\n(1432.06, 1435.16)  Let me bring you to another level of awareness.\n(1435.26, 1435.16) \n(1439.8, 1443.16)  Awareness, awareness, awareness is the gift of the heart. So today, ask God to be with us in our prayer life.\n(1443.16, 1445.72)  Thank God that you are Martha and Mary.\n(1445.72, 1447.68)  At the end of mass, there were a lot of young people\n(1447.68, 1450.14)  at the 1030, and I asked them on the way out\n(1450.14, 1451.96)  when they said hello to me, I said,\n(1451.96, 1453.8)  what are you mostly like?\n(1453.8, 1455.56)  Oh, Martha, definitely Martha.\n(1455.56, 1457.64)  I said, but what are you searching for?\n(1457.64, 1461.42)  They listened, a balance to life, and that's what we need.\n(1461.42, 1464.64)  So ask the Lord to bless you for your faith today,\n(1464.64, 1467.2)  And you and I have chosen the better part\n(1467.2, 1470.26)  by being here this morning, rather than having a hot dog\n(1470.26, 1472.4)  down at Castle Island before mass.\n(1472.4, 1473.24)  Amen.\n(1489.16, 1492.4)  Let us stand now, let us join in the prayer.\n(1492.4, 1496.4)  I sing before God, the Father, the Lord, and the Son,\n(1496.4, 1500.4)  and the Son, and the Holy One, and the Holy One,\n(1500.4, 1502.4)  and the Holy One, and the Holy One, and the Holy One,\n(1502.4, 1504.4)  and the Holy One, and the Holy One,\n(1504.4, 1506.4)  and the Holy One, and the Holy One,\n(1506.4, 1508.4)  and the Holy One, and the Holy One,\n(1508.4, 1510.4)  and the Holy One, and the Holy One,\n(1510.4, 1512.4)  and the Holy One, and the Holy One,\n(1512.4, 1514.4)  and the Holy One, and the Holy One,\n(1514.4, 1516.4)  and the Holy One, and the Holy One,\n(1516.4, 1518.4)  and the Holy One, and the Holy One,\n(1518.4, 1520.4)  and the Holy One, and the Holy One,\n(1520.4, 1521.4)  and the Holy One, and the Holy One, and the Holy One,\n(1521.4, 1526.4)  The Holy Spirit is going away from you.\n(1526.4, 1529.56)  My safety is crucified under Pontius Pilate,\n(1529.56, 1531.52)  except for God is not there,\n(1531.52, 1534.02)  and the third is not there yet.\n(1534.02, 1536.72)  In the scriptures, read your hand into heaven\n(1536.72, 1539.88)  and receive it at the right hand of the Father.\n(1539.88, 1543.0)  You are going to gain glory to judge the living and the dead.\n(1543.0, 1545.36)  This community will have no end.\n(1545.36, 1549.0)  I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord God of the Light,\n(1549.0, 1554.44)  proceeds from the Father and the Son. With the Father and the Son is adored and glorified,\n(1554.44, 1560.04)  who has broken through the prophets. I believe in one holy Catholic and apostolic church.\n(1560.68, 1566.12)  I confess one baptism for the forgiveness of sins, and I look forward to the resurrection of the\n(1566.12, 1571.88)  dead and the life of the world to come. Amen. Ever mindful of God's love for us this day,\n(1571.88, 1575.0)  we place before the altar of Christ our prayer of the faithful.\n(1577.56, 1575.0) \n(1584.04, 1585.32)  For all who leave the Church, may God provide them with the graces they need in their ministry. We pray to the Lord.\n(1585.32, 1587.2)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1587.2, 1592.52)  For peace in the Middle East and Ukraine, may all people be healed from the pain and\n(1592.52, 1598.48)  oppression they have endured, and may God provide the leaders the fortitude to secure\n(1598.48, 1602.8)  lasting peace and harmony for all their people.\n(1602.8, 1604.08)  We pray to the Lord.\n(1604.08, 1606.08)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1606.08, 1608.82)  For those who wonder where God may be calling them\n(1608.82, 1613.04)  in life's journey, may they consider Martha and Mary's life\n(1613.04, 1617.88)  of activity and contemplation in the service of the Lord\n(1617.88, 1621.6)  and find light for their journey, we pray to the Lord.\n(1621.6, 1623.68)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1623.68, 1627.84)  We pray for those of us who are strong\n(1627.84, 1629.92)  will always come to the assistance\n(1629.92, 1632.72)  of those who are weak, those who are\n(1632.72, 1638.08)  wealthy to the assistance of the poor and those who are healthy to the\n(1638.08, 1646.04)  assistance of the sick. We pray to the Lord for all who have passed away in\n(1646.04, 1651.62)  the light of Christ, especially John Cog Fallon, for whom this mass is\n(1651.62, 1657.52)  offered and for all of our deceased relative friends and parishioners. May\n(1657.52, 1660.46)  May the Lord bring them to everlasting life,\n(1660.46, 1662.16)  we pray to the Lord.\n(1662.16, 1667.76)  May the silent prayers in our hearts be lifted up to God,\n(1667.76, 1677.84)  who knows our needs even before we ask.\n(1677.84, 1680.88)  We pray to the Lord.\n(1680.88, 1683.88)  Let us pray for all visitors to go to heaven today,\n(1683.88, 1686.88)  and family and friends that visit Southie in the summer.\n(1686.88, 1689.4)  Let us pray for those that live far from home.\n(1689.4, 1692.54)  Many of you have families other places in the United States.\n(1692.54, 1695.72)  Let us pray for that family member, our mom and dad,\n(1695.72, 1697.42)  that need our prayers in remembrance\n(1697.42, 1699.44)  of their generosity and love to you.\n(1699.44, 1700.68)  We pray to the Lord.\n(1701.8, 1704.8)  Loving God, we open our hearts to your love this day,\n(1704.8, 1708.36)  offering our prayers to you through Christ our Lord, amen.\n(1708.36, 1710.52)  Please be seated now as we prepare for you.\n(1714.2, 1710.52) \n(1720.06, 1722.86)  Please join me in singing our offertory hymn number 458 in the hymnal, I Heard the Voice of Jesus, number 458.\n(1722.86, 1734.56)  Thank you so much, very good, thanks.\n(1734.56, 1745.12)  I heard the voice of Jesus say, come unto me and rest.\n(1745.12, 1756.04)  Lay down, thou weary one, lay down thy head upon my breast.\n(1756.04, 1766.64)  I came to Jesus as I was, so weary, worn, and sad.\n(1766.64, 1777.88)  I found in Him a resting place, and He has made me glad.\n(1777.88, 1784.72)  I heard the voice of Jesus say, behold,\n(1784.72, 1799.42)  I freely give the living water, thirsty one, stoop down and drink and live.\n(1799.42, 1810.24)  I came to Jesus and I drank of that life-giving stream.\n(1810.24, 1822.24)  My thirst was quenched, my soul revived, and now I live in Him.\n(1832.24, 1838.24)  Pray, my brothers and sisters, that this sacrifice may be acceptable to God the Almighty Father.\n(1840.24, 1851.76)  Accept, O Lord, we pray the offerings which we bring from the abundance of your gifts,\n(1851.76, 1857.68)  that through the powerful working of your grace these most sacred mysteries may sanctify\n(1857.68, 1864.32)  our present way of life and lead us to eternal gladness through Christ our Lord.\n(1864.32, 1867.2)  My friends, the Lord be with you.\n(1867.2, 1869.36)  Lift up your hearts.\n(1869.36, 1875.54)  us give thanks to the Lord our God. It is truly right in just our duty and our\n(1875.54, 1880.96)  salvation, always and everywhere to give you thanks, Lord Holy Father, Almighty\n(1880.96, 1886.0)  and eternal God, through Christ our Lord. For out of compassion for the weight\n(1886.0, 1891.26)  witness that is ours, he humbled himself and was born of the Virgin. By the\n(1891.26, 1895.66)  passion of the cross he freed us from ending death, by rising from the dead he\n(1895.66, 1900.86)  gave us life eternal, and so with all the angels, archangels, thrones, and dominions,\n(1900.86, 1908.34)  with all the hosts and powers of heaven, we sing the hymn of your glory as without end\n(1908.34, 1909.34)  we acclaim.\n(1909.34, 1930.34)  Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts Heaven and earth are full of your glory.\n(1930.34, 1938.34)  Hosanna in the highest, Hosanna in the highest.\n(1938.34, 1953.06)  Hosanna in the highest, Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.\n(1953.06, 1967.14)  Hosanna in the highest, Hosanna in the highest.\n(1967.14, 1970.78)  You are indeed holy, O Lord, the fount of all holiness.\n(1970.78, 1975.9)  Make holy these gifts, we pray, by sending down Your Spirit upon them like the dewfall,\n(1975.9, 1981.78)  that they may become for us the body and blood of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.\n(1981.78, 1988.06)  At the time He was betrayed and entered willingly into His passion, He took bread in giving\n(1988.06, 1993.34)  thanks, broke it, gave it to His disciples, saying, Take this, all of you, and eat of\n(1993.34, 1997.42)  for this is my body, which will be given up for you.\n(2007.82, 2011.66)  In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took the chalice.\n(2011.66, 2015.42)  Once more giving thanks, he gave it to his disciples, saying,\n(2015.42, 2017.98)  Take this, all of you, and drink from it.\n(2017.98, 2022.62)  For this is the chalice of my blood, the blood of the new and eternal covenant,\n(2022.62, 2028.34)  which will be put out for you and for many, for the forgiveness of sins.\n(2028.34, 2031.34)  Do this in memory of me.\n(2052.62, 2076.18)  Therefore, as we celebrate the memorial of His death and resurrection, we offer You,\n(2076.18, 2080.9)  Lord, the bread of life and the chalice of salvation, giving thanks that You have held\n(2080.9, 2085.82)  us worthy to be in your presence and minister to you.\n(2085.82, 2093.54)  Humbly we pray that, partaking of the body and blood of Christ, we may be gathered into\n(2093.54, 2095.94)  one by the Holy Spirit.\n(2095.94, 2099.78)  Remember, Lord, your Church, spread throughout the world.\n(2099.78, 2105.02)  Bring her to the fullness of charity, together with your servant, Pope Leo, our Bishop Richard,\n(2105.02, 2106.02)  all the clergy.\n(2106.02, 2110.18)  Oh, Lord, today in prayer, remember our brother in Christ, John, whom you've called from this\n(2110.18, 2115.38)  wrote to yourself, grant that John, who was united with your son in a death like his,\n(2115.38, 2119.62)  may also be one with him in his resurrection.\n(2119.62, 2124.62)  Remember also our brothers and sisters who have fallen asleep in the hope of the resurrection\n(2124.62, 2128.66)  and all who have died in your mercy.\n(2128.66, 2130.98)  Welcome them into the light of your face.\n(2130.98, 2136.18)  Have mercy on us all, we pray, with the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God, with the Blessed\n(2136.18, 2140.82)  Apostles, St. Bridget, St. Augustine, Gate of Heaven, and all the Saints who have pleased\n(2140.82, 2145.86)  you throughout the ages, that we may merit to be coheirs to eternal life, and praise\n(2145.86, 2150.62)  and glorify you through your Son, Jesus Christ.\n(2150.62, 2155.42)  For it is through him, with him, in him, O God Almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy\n(2155.42, 2159.86)  Spirit, our glory and honor is yours forever and ever.\n(2166.18, 2181.5)  At the Savior's command and formed by divine teaching, we dare to say, Our Father, who\n(2181.5, 2184.26)  art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.\n(2184.26, 2189.82)  Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.\n(2189.82, 2195.9)  Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who\n(2195.9, 2200.06)  trespass against us, and lead us not into temptation,\n(2200.06, 2202.26)  but deliver us from evil.\n(2202.26, 2205.54)  Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil.\n(2205.54, 2209.3)  Graciously grant peace in our days,\n(2209.3, 2212.58)  that by the help of your mercy,\n(2212.58, 2215.84)  we may be always free from sin,\n(2216.88, 2221.88)  safe from all distress, as we await the blessed hope\n(2223.46, 2221.88) \n(2229.28, 2232.2)  blessed hope in the coming of our Savior Jesus Christ, for the kingdom, the power and the glory are yours, now and forever.\n(2232.2, 2237.6)  Lord Jesus Christ, you said to your apostles, peace I leave you, my peace I give you, look\n(2237.6, 2244.12)  not on our sins, but on the faith of your church, and graciously grant her peace and\n(2244.12, 2250.76)  unity in accordance with your will, who live and reign forever and ever.\n(2250.76, 2256.76)  On this beautiful day, may the peace of Christ be with all of you, and with your spirit today.\n(2256.76, 2260.76)  Let's talk to each other as a sign of that peace.\n(2274.76, 2260.76) \n(2286.0, 2298.0)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us. Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(2298.0, 2313.0)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, grant us peace.\n(2313.0, 2317.6)  Behold the Lamb of God! Behold Him who takes away the sins of the world!\n(2317.6, 2320.2)  Blessed are those called to the Supper of the Lamb!\n(2320.2, 2323.2)  Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof.\n(2343.0, 2357.0)  Our communion hymn is number 386 in the hymnal The Servant song, number 386.\n(2373.0, 2394.56)  Will you let me be your servant, Let me be as Christ to you?\n(2394.56, 2407.04)  May the time may have the grace to let you be my servant too.\n(2407.04, 2412.52)  We are pilgrims on our journey.\n(2412.52, 2418.0)  We are travelers on the road.\n(2418.0, 2423.0)  We are here to help each other.\n(2423.0, 2430.2)  Walk the vial and bear the load.\n(2430.2, 2435.48)  I will hold the Christ's light for you\n(2435.48, 2440.6)  in the nighttime of your fear.\n(2440.6, 2448.2)  I will hold my hand out to you, speak the peace you're\n(2448.2, 2463.2)  I will weep when you are weeping, When you laugh, I'll laugh with you.\n(2463.2, 2475.2)  I will share your joy and sorrow, Till we've seen this journey through.\n(2475.2, 2485.7)  When we sing to God in heaven, we shall find such harmony,\n(2485.7, 2498.7)  born of all we've known together of Christ's love and agony.\n(2505.2, 2534.68)  I'll see you in the next video, bye bye.\n(2535.2, 2542.2)  You alone are worthy to be honored and adored, Mercy you have given, blindness you have shown.\n(2542.2, 2545.2)  You alone are worthy to be honored and adored, Mercy you have given, blindness you have shown.\n(2545.2, 2551.2)  You alone are worthy to be honored and adored, Mercy you have given, kindness you have shown.\n(2551.2, 2558.2)  You alone are worthy to be honored and adored, Mercy you have given, kindness you have shown.\n(2558.2, 2564.2)  You alone are worthy to be honored and adored, Mercy you have given, kindness you have shown.\n(2564.2, 2593.2)  Love is you alone, all of us is sinless in this place, all of us deserves your saving grace, all of us is good at all, without your blessed love that falls upon our hearts to heal our broken heads.\n(2593.2, 2612.2)  You alone are holy. You alone are Lord. You all are worthy to be hardened and adored.\n(2612.2, 2624.7)  Mercy you have given, kindness you have shown, Love is you alone.\n(2624.7, 2637.2)  What is there to do but thank you then, For the gift that we might call you forever?\n(2637.2, 2651.2)  Great love has not been known that that for which you gave your only son, that you might see us pure and blessed.\n(2653.2, 2659.2)  You alone are holy, you alone are low.\n(2659.2, 2665.2)  You alone are worthy to be honored and adored.\n(2665.2, 2677.2)  mercy you have given, kindness you have shown, love is you alone.\n(2695.2, 2710.2)  Our meditation for today, as we go forth for the week, the better part is not what is left\n(2710.2, 2713.7)  over or empty at the end of the day.\n(2713.7, 2718.24)  We have to constantly choose and seek out the better part.\n(2718.24, 2725.14)  But like Martha, we can sometimes become obsessed with all the distractions and the busy business\n(2725.14, 2731.62)  and busyness of everyday life, that we oversee and fail to recognize what the better part\n(2731.62, 2732.62)  would be for us.\n(2732.62, 2740.38)  It can be a tough balance in everyday life because of power, possessions, and pleasure.\n(2740.38, 2747.58)  Jesus calls us today in our liturgy that we should be open to the gift of God's grace.\n(2747.58, 2753.88)  Whether we tend to be like Martha, who is very efficient, or Mary inspired by sensitivity\n(2753.88, 2756.14)  and contemplative spirit.\n(2756.14, 2758.3)  Today, as we go forth for the week,\n(2758.3, 2761.06)  we seek, oh Lord, to balance that gift\n(2761.06, 2764.24)  that you have given us in Martha and Mary,\n(2764.24, 2767.14)  and know that in our heart, the greatest gift,\n(2767.14, 2770.72)  by opening to that invitation of the better part,\n(2770.72, 2775.72)  will always lead us to greater joy, happiness,\n(2775.96, 2778.68)  and the gift of God's love for us.\n(2778.68, 2781.28)  Thank you, Lord, for inviting this week\n(2781.28, 2783.68)  to seek the better part.\n(2783.68, 2795.44)  Let us stand, let us pray.\n(2795.44, 2800.92)  We have consumed, O Lord, the Divine Sacrament, the perpetual memorial of the Passion of Your\n(2800.92, 2801.92)  Son.\n(2801.92, 2807.04)  Grant, we pray, that this gift which He Himself gave us with love beyond telling may profit\n(2807.04, 2810.28)  us for salvation through Christ our Lord.\n(2810.28, 2811.28)  Amen.\n(2811.28, 2813.6)  The Lord be with you.\n(2813.6, 2816.36)  On this most glorious day, may you bow your heads\n(2816.36, 2818.08)  and pray for God's blessings.\n(2818.08, 2819.62)  May the Lord bless you and keep you.\n(2819.62, 2822.84)  May his face shine upon you and be gracious to you.\n(2822.84, 2825.42)  Bless in you in the name of the Father, the Son,\n(2825.42, 2827.36)  and the Holy Spirit, amen.\n(2827.36, 2828.56)  Our celebration has ended.\n(2828.56, 2830.54)  Let us go in the peace of Christ.\n(2830.54, 2832.12)  Thanks be to God.\n(2832.12, 2834.72)  Have a good week seeking the better part.\n(2834.72, 2835.8)  Nice to be with you.\n(2835.8, 2837.52)  Let us go forth now in song.\n(2839.48, 2843.36)  Please join in singing our closing hymn number 195\n(2843.36, 2848.36)  in the hymnal, Go Make of All Disciples, number 195.\n(2848.36, 2874.24)  Go, make of all disciples, we hear the call, O Lord, that comes from you, our Father, in\n(2874.24, 2888.64)  your eternal word. Inspire ways of turning through earnest, fervent prayer.\n(2888.64, 2899.76)  And let our daily living reveal you everywhere.\n(2899.76, 2914.48)  Go make of all disciples, baptizing in the name of Father, Son, and Spirit.\n(2914.48, 2928.88)  From age to age the same, we call each new disciple to follow you, O Lord.\n(2928.88, 2944.4)  Redeeming soul and body, by water and the Word.\n",

        "transcript": "(239.0, 252.94)  Your priests, O Lord, shall be clothed with justice.\n(252.94, 255.34)  Your holy ones shall ring out their joy.\n(255.34, 258.86)  In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, amen.\n(258.86, 261.86)  The Lord be with you.\n(261.86, 266.34)  Today's Mass is offered for the St. Bridgett Memorial Society and we celebrate the Feast\n(266.34, 267.92)  of St. Charbel.\n(267.92, 272.18)  My brothers and sisters, let us acknowledge our sins and so prepare ourselves to celebrate\n(272.18, 275.44)  the sacred mysteries.\n(275.44, 282.54)  I confess to Almighty God and to you, my brothers and sisters, that I have greatly sinned in\n(282.54, 288.26)  my thoughts and in my words and what I have done and what I have failed to do through\n(288.26, 292.2)  my fault, through my fault, through my most grievous fault.\n(292.2, 299.0)  Therefore, I ask the Blessed Mary of a virgin, all the angels and saints, and you, my brothers and sisters,\n(299.58, 301.64)  to pray for me to the Lord our God.\n(302.16, 306.92)  May Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us our sins, and bring us to everlasting life.\n(307.92, 309.92)  Lord, have mercy.\n(310.44, 312.44)  Christ, have mercy.\n(313.2, 315.2)  Lord, have mercy.\n(316.28, 318.28)  Let us pray.\n(320.76, 318.28) \n(327.36, 332.82)  O God, who called the priest, Saint Charbelle Macluff, to the solitary combat of the desert, and imbued him with all manner of devotion, grant us, we pray, that being made imitators\n(332.82, 337.96)  of the Lord's Passion, we may merit to be co-heirs of his kingdom, who lives and reigns\n(337.96, 343.44)  with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.\n(357.64, 363.84)  Our reading from the book of Exodus. In the third month after their departure\n(363.84, 369.48)  from the land of Egypt, on its first day, the children of Israel came to the desert\n(369.48, 371.68)  of Sinai.\n(371.68, 378.24)  After the journey from Ahivam to the desert of Sinai, they pitched camp.\n(378.24, 384.12)  While Israel was encamped here in front of the mountain, the Lord told Moses, I am coming\n(384.12, 390.16)  to you in a dense cloud, so that when the people hear me speaking with you, they may\n(390.16, 396.4)  may always have faith in you also.\"\n(420.06, 396.4) \n(403.16, 408.48)  response of the people, the Lord added, go to the people and have them sanctify themselves today and tomorrow. Make them wash their garments and be ready for the\n(408.48, 415.56)  third day. For on the third day the Lord will come down on Mount Sinai before the\n(415.56, 421.68)  eyes of all the people. On the morning of the third day there were peals of\n(421.68, 426.32)  thunder and lightning and a heavy cloud over the mountain and a very loud\n(426.32, 432.88)  trumpet blast, so that all the people in the camp trembled. But Moses led the\n(432.88, 437.48)  people out of the camp to meet God, and they stationed themselves at the foot of\n(437.48, 444.56)  the mountain. Mount Sinai was all wrapped in smoke, for the Lord came down upon it\n(444.56, 452.0)  in fire. The smoke rose from it as though from a furnace, and the whole mountain\n(452.0, 458.0)  trembled violently. The trumpet blast grew louder and louder while Moses was\n(458.0, 464.52)  speaking with God and God answering him with thunder. When the Lord came down to\n(464.52, 471.2)  the top of Mount Sinai, he summoned Moses to the top of the mountain. The Word of\n(471.2, 478.76)  the Lord. Glory and praise forever.\n(479.94, 478.76) \n(486.5, 508.76)  Blessed are you, O Lord,\n(518.36, 523.32)  Blessed are you on the throne of your kingdom, praiseworthy and exulted above all forever. Blessed are you who look upon the depths from the throne upon the cherubim, praiseworthy\n(523.32, 529.48)  and exulted above all forever.\n(529.48, 553.84)  I study you in the firmament\n(559.08, 553.84) \n(562.74, 567.42)  Lord be with you. A reading from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew. The disciples approached Jesus and said why do you speak to the crowds in parables?\n(567.42, 572.08)  He said to them because knowledge of the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven has\n(572.08, 577.72)  been granted to you, but to them it has not been granted. To anyone who has, more\n(577.72, 583.0)  will be given and he will grow rich. For anyone who has not, even what he has will\n(583.0, 588.4)  be taken away. This is why I speak to them in parables because they look but\n(588.4, 593.76)  do not see and hear but do not listen or understand. Isaiah's prophecy is\n(593.76, 599.0)  fulfilled in them which says you shall indeed hear but not understand you shall\n(599.0, 604.48)  indeed look but never see. Gross is the heart of this people they will hardly\n(604.48, 608.76)  hear with their ears they have closed their eyes lest they see with their eyes\n(608.76, 614.08)  and hear with their ears and understand with their hearts and be converted and I\n(614.08, 619.56)  heal them but blessed are your eyes because they see and your ears because\n(619.56, 625.2)  they hear amen I say to you many prophets and righteous people long to\n(625.2, 629.34)  see what you see but did not see it and to hear what you hear but did not hear\n(629.34, 639.8)  the gospel of the Lord. In the seminary school we used to have what were called\n(639.8, 643.56)  formation meetings where you would meet one-on-one with the priest and you and\n(643.56, 647.82)  you had to prepare a report on how you were doing and what you were struggling\n(647.82, 652.64)  with etc and in the very beginning of seminary I used to just kind of show up\n(652.64, 657.24)  and shoot from the hip in these meetings and the priest said to me I'll never\n(657.24, 664.54)  forget it he said you know we prepare for things we care about and that cut a\n(664.54, 668.82)  little bit deep because he sort of accused me of not taking the process of\n(668.82, 674.18)  preparing to be a priest seriously and those words are very true when we care\n(674.18, 678.0)  about something whether it's an important meeting a project even a date\n(678.0, 683.82)  we put effort into preparing for said things I share this with you because\n(683.82, 689.82)  Moses has a message from the Lord before they're going to meet the Lord in\n(689.82, 696.9)  worship Moses is told by God tell the people to sanctify themselves today and\n(696.9, 702.46)  tomorrow make sure they wash their garments and be ready for the third day\n(702.46, 708.3)  for on the third day I will come down on the Mount Sinai before the eyes of all\n(708.3, 712.78)  the people. Before we meet God, if we truly want to\n(712.78, 717.26)  encounter him, we have to prepare. We have to be ready\n(717.26, 722.94)  especially every time we come to mass because the Lord reveals himself in a\n(722.94, 726.7)  far more personal way than he did in the cloud of glory on\n(726.7, 730.06)  Mount Sinai. And so practical ways we prepare\n(730.06, 733.18)  ourselves for mass, obviously the ways the church\n(733.18, 738.22)  tells us we should abstain from eating for at least an hour before,\n(738.22, 739.98)  We should be recollected.\n(739.98, 743.14)  We should have some silence before we come to mass.\n(743.14, 745.82)  It's beautiful to see that the number of people\n(745.82, 747.74)  coming to mass is increasing daily\n(747.74, 751.22)  and also people praying before the mass.\n(751.22, 755.02)  What a beautiful way to prepare to meet the Lord.\n(755.02, 757.78)  Because as Jesus said in the gospel,\n(757.78, 761.28)  many generations longed to see what you see\n(761.28, 763.46)  and they didn't see it.\n(763.46, 766.94)  What a privilege it is to see the Lord every day.\n(766.94, 770.0)  and that requires attentive preparation.\n(770.0, 772.4)  And so let us stand and make our petitions known\n(772.4, 773.74)  to our Heavenly Father.\n(775.88, 778.8)  We pray for Pope Leo and for Bishop Richard Henning\n(778.8, 780.88)  and for all bishops throughout the church.\n(780.88, 784.38)  May God give them the grace to be true shepherds of souls\n(784.38, 786.48)  so all can come to know the love of Christ.\n(786.48, 787.74)  We pray to the Lord.\n(789.68, 791.92)  We pray for all civil leaders, governments,\n(791.92, 793.72)  and elected officials throughout the world.\n(793.72, 795.96)  May they enact policies that protect the church\n(795.96, 798.02)  and give her the freedom to be herself\n(798.02, 799.84)  so the kingdom of God can be spread\n(799.84, 801.28)  to every corner of the globe.\n(801.28, 802.54)  We pray to the Lord.\n(804.28, 807.32)  We pray for an increase of vocations to the priesthood\n(807.32, 808.84)  and to the religious life,\n(808.84, 811.04)  especially for members from our own parishes\n(811.04, 812.16)  and our own families.\n(812.16, 813.42)  We pray to the Lord.\n(814.7, 816.3)  And we pray for all of the members\n(816.3, 818.18)  of the St. Bridgett Memorial Society\n(818.18, 819.72)  for whom this mass is offered.\n(819.72, 820.98)  We pray to the Lord.\n(822.56, 824.46)  Heavenly Father, we make these prayers\n(824.46, 828.08)  with great confidence as we ask them through the intercession of Mary, Queen\n(828.08, 831.48)  of the Rosary and Gate of Heaven, and we speak them in the name of Jesus, her son,\n(831.48, 835.52)  who is Lord forever and ever.\n(913.46, 933.7)  Pray, brothers and sisters, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God, the Almighty\n(933.7, 943.38)  Father.\n(943.38, 948.18)  O Lord we pray the offerings placed on your altar in commemoration of Blessed\n(948.18, 953.06)  Charbel so that as you brought him glory you may through these sacred mysteries\n(953.06, 960.78)  grant to us your pardon through Christ our Lord the Lord be with you lift up\n(960.78, 967.94)  your hearts let us give thanks to the Lord our God it is truly right and just\n(967.94, 972.86)  our duty and our salvation always and everywhere to give you thanks Lord holy\n(972.86, 977.14)  Father, Almighty and Eternal God, through Christ our Lord. For in the marvelous\n(977.14, 981.34)  confession of your saints, you make your church fruitful with strength ever new,\n(981.34, 986.4)  and offer us sure signs of your love. And that your saving mysteries may be\n(986.4, 991.46)  fulfilled, their great example lends us courage, their fervent prayers sustains\n(991.46, 996.58)  us in all we do. And so, Lord, with all the angels and saints, we too give you\n(996.58, 999.3)  thanks as an exultation we acclaim.\n(999.3, 1003.56)  Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts,\n(1003.56, 1006.18)  heaven and earth are full of your glory.\n(1006.18, 1008.28)  Hosanna in the highest.\n(1008.28, 1011.38)  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.\n(1011.38, 1013.34)  Hosanna in the highest.\n(1015.78, 1017.62)  You are indeed holy, O Lord,\n(1017.62, 1020.18)  and all you have created rightly gives you praise.\n(1020.18, 1022.96)  For through your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ,\n(1022.96, 1025.54)  by the power and working of the Holy Spirit,\n(1025.54, 1028.34)  you give life to all things and make them holy,\n(1028.34, 1031.22)  and you never cease to gather a people to yourself,\n(1031.22, 1034.08)  so that from the rising of the sun to its setting,\n(1034.08, 1037.56)  a pure sacrifice may be offered to your name.\n(1037.56, 1040.42)  Therefore, O Lord, we humbly implore you,\n(1040.42, 1043.38)  by the same Spirit graciously make holy these gifts\n(1043.38, 1045.62)  we have brought to you for consecration,\n(1045.62, 1048.42)  that they may become the body and blood\n(1048.42, 1051.1)  of your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ,\n(1051.1, 1054.1)  at whose command we celebrate these mysteries.\n(1054.1, 1058.6)  For on the night he was betrayed, he himself took bread.\n(1058.6, 1062.32)  And giving you thanks, he said the blessing, broke the bread,\n(1062.32, 1068.52)  and gave it to his disciples, saying, take this, all of you,\n(1068.52, 1070.2)  and eat of it.\n(1070.2, 1075.22)  For this is my body, which will be given up for you.\n(1084.1, 1096.5)  In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took the chalice, and giving you thanks he\n(1096.5, 1101.14)  said the blessing, and gave the chalice to his disciples, saying,\n(1101.14, 1109.94)  Take this, all of you, and drink from it, for this is the chalice of my blood, the blood\n(1109.94, 1114.54)  of the new and eternal covenant, which will be poured out for you and for many for the\n(1114.54, 1116.82)  forgiveness of sins.\n(1116.82, 1136.2)  Do this in memory of me.\n(1136.2, 1142.84)  The mystery of faith. Save us, Savior of the world, for by your cross and resurrection,\n(1142.84, 1148.1)  you have set us free. Therefore, O Lord, as we celebrate the memorial of the saving passion\n(1148.1, 1152.72)  of your Son, his wondrous resurrection and ascension into heaven, and as we look forward\n(1152.72, 1158.16)  to his second coming, we offer you in thanksgiving this holy and living sacrifice. Look, we pray,\n(1158.16, 1162.88)  upon the oblation of your church, in recognizing the sacrificial victim by whose death you\n(1162.88, 1167.32)  willed to reconcile us to yourself. Granted, we who are nourished by the body\n(1167.32, 1171.64)  and blood of your Son, and filled with this Holy Spirit, may become one body, one\n(1171.64, 1176.14)  spirit in Christ. May he make of us an eternal offering to you, so that we may\n(1176.14, 1180.18)  obtain an inheritance with your elect, especially with the most blessed Virgin\n(1180.18, 1185.0)  Mary, Mother of God, with blessed Joseph, her spouse, with your blessed apostles and\n(1185.0, 1189.72)  glorious martyrs, with Saint Charbel, and with all the saints, on whose constant\n(1189.72, 1193.56)  intercession in your presence, we rely for unfailing help.\n(1193.56, 1197.1)  May this sacrifice of our reconciliation, we pray, O Lord,\n(1197.1, 1199.92)  advance the peace and salvation of all the world.\n(1199.92, 1202.12)  Be pleased to confirm in faith and charity\n(1202.12, 1204.92)  your pilgrim church on earth, with your servant Leo,\n(1204.92, 1208.34)  our pope, and Richard, our bishop, the order of bishops,\n(1208.34, 1210.76)  all the clergy, and the entire people you have gained\n(1210.76, 1212.06)  for your own.\n(1212.06, 1215.28)  Listen graciously to the prayers of this family,\n(1215.28, 1217.2)  whom you have summoned before you.\n(1217.2, 1219.46)  In your compassion, O merciful Father,\n(1219.46, 1221.14)  Gather to yourself all your children\n(1221.14, 1222.8)  scattered throughout the world.\n(1222.8, 1224.9)  To our departed brothers and sisters,\n(1224.9, 1226.18)  and to all who are pleasing to you\n(1226.18, 1228.1)  at their passing from this life,\n(1228.1, 1230.06)  give kind admittance to your kingdom.\n(1230.06, 1233.02)  There we hope to enjoy forever the fullness of your glory,\n(1233.02, 1234.4)  through Christ our Lord,\n(1234.4, 1237.14)  through whom you bestow on the world all that is good.\n(1240.82, 1243.38)  Through him and with him and in him,\n(1243.38, 1245.1)  O God, almighty Father,\n(1245.1, 1247.08)  in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\n(1247.08, 1249.22)  all glory and honor is yours,\n(1249.22, 1254.08)  forever and ever.\n(1254.08, 1259.56)  At the Saviour's command, informed by divine teaching, we dare to say,\n(1259.56, 1263.84)  Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.\n(1263.84, 1268.8)  Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.\n(1268.8, 1273.6)  Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses,\n(1273.6, 1277.1)  as we forgive those who trespass against us,\n(1277.1, 1281.66)  And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.\n(1281.66, 1286.3)  Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil, graciously grant peace in our days, that by\n(1286.3, 1291.3)  the help of your mercy we may be always free from sin and safe from all distress, as we\n(1291.3, 1299.86)  await the blessed hope and the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ.\n(1299.86, 1304.46)  Lord Jesus Christ, who said to your apostles, peace I leave you, my peace I give you, look\n(1304.46, 1308.7)  Look not on our sins but on the faith of your church, and graciously grant her peace and\n(1308.7, 1313.02)  unity in accordance with your will, who live and reign forever and ever.\n(1313.02, 1316.48)  The peace of the Lord be with you always.\n(1316.48, 1322.86)  Let us offer each other the sign of peace.\n(1322.86, 1328.3)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1328.3, 1333.46)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1333.46, 1356.42)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, grant us peace.\n(1356.42, 1361.54)  Behold the Lamb of God, behold Him who takes away the sins of the world.\n(1361.54, 1366.98)  are those called to the supper of the land. Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter\n(1366.98, 1370.98)  under my roof, but only say the word and my soul shall be healed.\n(1391.54, 1421.5)  Blessed is the servant the Lord finds watching when he comes, amen I say to you, he will\n(1421.5, 1428.5)  put that servant in charge of all of his property.\n(1570.5, 1577.5)  So, thank you very much for your attention and I look forward to seeing you again soon.\n(1660.5, 1672.7)  Let us pray.\n(1672.7, 1677.86)  May partaking at the heavenly table, O mighty God, confirm and increase strength from on\n(1677.86, 1683.98)  high and all who celebrate the feast day of blessed Charbel, that we may preserve, that\n(1683.98, 1689.54)  we may persevere in integrity the gift of faith and walk in the path of salvation you\n(1689.54, 1696.92)  trace for us through Christ our Lord the Lord be with you may Almighty God bless\n(1696.92, 1705.36)  you the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit go forth the masses ended st.\n(1705.36, 1710.36)  Michael the Archangel defend us in battle be our protection against the\n(1710.36, 1715.88)  wickedness and snares of the devil may God rebuke him we humbly pray and do\n(1715.88, 1721.34)  Thou are the prince of the heavenly hosts by the power of God cast into hell Satan\n(1721.34, 1729.54)  and all the evil spirits who prowl about the world seeking the ruin of souls.

My brothers and sisters let us acknowledge our sins\n(274.1, 280.46)  and so prepare ourselves to celebrate the sacred mysteries. I confess to\n(280.46, 286.22)  Almighty God and to you my brothers and sisters that I have greatly sinned in my\n(286.22, 291.66)  thoughts and in my words and what I have done what I have failed to do through my\n(291.66, 296.66)  fault through my fault through my most grievous fault therefore I ask the\n(296.66, 300.7)  blessed Mary ever-virgin, all the angels and saints,\n(300.7, 302.86)  and you, my brothers and sisters,\n(302.86, 305.38)  to pray for me, the Lord our God.\n(305.38, 307.3)  May almighty God have mercy on us,\n(307.3, 310.86)  forgive us our sins, and bring us to everlasting life.\n(310.86, 312.06)  Lord, have mercy.\n(313.18, 314.4)  Christ, have mercy.\n(315.52, 316.86)  Lord, have mercy.\n(319.3, 320.26)  Let us pray.\n(322.42, 326.18)  Oh God, who called the priest Saint Charbel-McClough\n(326.18, 328.86)  to the solitary combat of the desert\n(328.86, 331.5)  and imbued him with all manner of devotion.\n(331.5, 334.3)  Grant us, we pray, that being made imitators\n(334.3, 337.3)  of the Lord's passion, we may merit to be co-heirs\n(337.3, 339.74)  of his kingdom, who lives and reigns with you\n(339.74, 343.38)  in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God forever and ever.\n(356.18, 361.54)  A reading from the book of Exodus.\n(361.54, 368.52)  In the third month after their departure from the land of Egypt, on its first day, the children\n(368.52, 373.24)  of Israel came to the desert of Sinai.\n(373.24, 379.96)  After the journey from Rephidim to the desert of Sinai, they pitched camp.\n(379.96, 385.8)  While Israel was encamped here in front of the mountain, the Lord told Moses,\n(385.8, 393.84)  I am coming to you in a dense cloud, so that when the people hear Me speaking with you,\n(393.84, 398.92)  they may always have faith in you also.\n(398.92, 405.54)  When Moses then had reported to the Lord the response of the people, the Lord added,\n(405.54, 412.24)  Go to the people and have them sanctify themselves today and tomorrow.\n(412.24, 418.66)  Make them wash their garments and be ready for the third day, for on the third day the\n(418.66, 426.12)  Lord will come down on Mount Sinai before the eyes of all the people.\n(426.12, 432.84)  On the morning of the third day there were peals of thunder and lightning and a heavy\n(432.84, 442.68)  cloud over the mountain and a very loud trumpet blast so that all the people in the camp trembled.\n(442.68, 448.8)  But Moses led the people out of the camp to meet God, and they stationed themselves at\n(448.8, 451.96)  the foot of the mountain.\n(451.96, 459.92)  Mount Sinai was all wrapped in smoke, for the Lord came down upon it in fire.\n(459.92, 468.12)  The smoke rose from it as though from a furnace, and the whole mountain trembled violently.\n(468.12, 475.32)  The trumpet blast grew louder and louder, while Moses was speaking and God answering\n(475.32, 478.32)  him with thunder.\n(478.32, 484.8)  When the Lord came down to the top of Mount Sinai, he summoned Moses up to the top of\n(484.8, 485.8)  the mountain.\n(485.8, 492.46)  The word of the Lord.\n(492.46, 497.28)  Glory and praise forever.\n(497.28, 504.4)  Blessed are you, O Lord, the God of our fathers, praiseworthy and exalted above all forever.\n(504.4, 511.08)  And blessed is your holy and glorious name, praiseworthy and exalted above all for the\n(511.08, 514.84)  ages.\n(514.84, 519.72)  Blessed are you in the temple of your holy glory, praiseworthy and glorious above all\n(519.72, 524.34)  forever.\n(524.34, 533.72)  Blessed are you on the throne of your kingdom, praiseworthy and exalted above all forever.\n(533.72, 539.96)  Blessed are you who look into the depths from your throne upon the cherubim, praiseworthy\n(539.96, 547.92)  and exalted above all forever blessed are you in the firmament of heaven\n(547.92, 552.6)  praiseworthy and glorious forever\n(567.44, 552.6) \n(570.76, 575.78)  The Lord be with you. A reading from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew.\n(575.78, 581.04)  The disciples approached Jesus and said, why do you speak to the crowd in parables?\n(581.04, 582.84)  He said to them in reply,\n(582.84, 585.46)  because knowledge of the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven\n(585.46, 587.16)  has been granted to you,\n(587.16, 589.48)  but to them it has not been granted.\n(589.48, 592.04)  To anyone who has, more will be given,\n(592.04, 593.72)  and he will grow rich.\n(593.72, 595.24)  From anyone who has not,\n(595.24, 597.96)  even what he has will be taken away.\n(597.96, 600.2)  This is why I speak to them in parables,\n(600.2, 602.52)  because they look but do not see,\n(602.52, 605.4)  and hear but do not listen or understand.\n(605.4, 609.18)  Isaiah's prophecy is fulfilled in them, which says,\n(609.18, 612.02)  You shall indeed hear, but not understand.\n(612.02, 614.82)  You shall indeed look, but never see.\n(614.82, 617.1)  Gross is the heart of this people.\n(617.1, 619.42)  They will hardly hear with their ears.\n(619.42, 621.14)  They have closed their eyes,\n(621.14, 624.28)  lest they see with their eyes and hear with their ears,\n(624.28, 626.18)  and understand with their hearts,\n(626.18, 628.22)  and be converted, and I heal them.\n(629.1, 631.94)  But blessed are your eyes because they see,\n(631.94, 634.04)  and your ears because they hear.\n(634.04, 637.78)  Amen, I say to you, many prophets and righteous people\n(637.78, 640.62)  long to see what you see but did not see it,\n(640.62, 643.48)  and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.\n(643.48, 645.0)  The gospel of the Lord.\n(650.04, 653.34)  In the seminary, we had what was called formation meetings,\n(653.34, 655.66)  where you would meet one-on-one with a priest,\n(655.66, 658.88)  and you would give a report on how you were doing,\n(658.88, 660.7)  and what you were struggling with,\n(660.7, 662.58)  and areas you needed to grow.\n(662.58, 665.0)  And when I first started these formation meetings,\n(665.0, 667.26)  I used to go into them blind.\n(667.26, 669.74)  And one day my formation advisor said to me,\n(669.74, 673.02)  and it cut a little bit deep, but he said,\n(673.02, 676.26)  you prepare for things you care about.\n(676.26, 679.44)  And he challenged me to see that I wasn't really\n(679.44, 681.54)  taking the formation to the priesthood\n(681.54, 683.58)  as seriously as it demanded.\n(683.58, 685.18)  And there's so much truth to what\n(685.18, 688.42)  he says that we prepare for things we care about,\n(688.42, 692.26)  whether it's a meeting, a big presentation at work, a game,\n(692.26, 693.56)  a date, whatever it is.\n(693.56, 698.12)  we put effort into preparing if we want things to go well.\n(698.12, 700.2)  I share this with you because Moses\n(700.2, 704.08)  receives this exact message from the Lord.\n(704.08, 707.22)  The Lord gives Moses specific instructions\n(707.22, 710.22)  to give his people before they worship\n(710.22, 713.08)  and meet him on Mount Sinai, he says this.\n(713.08, 715.78)  He says, go to the people and have them\n(715.78, 718.54)  sanctify themselves today and tomorrow.\n(718.54, 723.18)  Make them wash their garments and be ready for the third day\n(723.18, 726.78)  for on the third day the Lord will come down on Mount Sinai\n(726.78, 729.58)  before the eyes of all the people.\n(729.58, 731.94)  Moses is instructed to have the people\n(731.94, 735.22)  prepare themselves to meet the Lord.\n(735.22, 738.14)  The same is true for us who come to Mass,\n(738.14, 740.38)  especially those who come every day.\n(740.38, 743.9)  It can become such a habit that we forget\n(743.9, 746.5)  that we should prepare to meet the Lord.\n(746.5, 749.38)  That's why the church asks us to refrain from eating\n(749.38, 751.66)  at least one hour before the Mass,\n(751.66, 754.02)  and of course to regularly go to confession\n(754.02, 758.16)  at least once a year to prepare to worship well.\n(758.16, 760.64)  But also, one thing we can do\n(760.64, 763.5)  is give ourselves a little bit of silence\n(763.5, 765.98)  so that when we come into the church,\n(765.98, 767.72)  we're ready to meet the Lord\n(767.72, 770.54)  because we've prepared to meet him.\n(770.54, 772.7)  Jesus says in the gospel today,\n(772.7, 776.78)  many generations longed to see what you see.\n(776.78, 780.46)  Many people longed to have the privilege\n(780.46, 784.18)  to receive Jesus in the Eucharist, to meet him every day,\n(784.18, 785.7)  in a more magnificent way\n(785.7, 789.46)  than the glory cloud on Mount Sinai.\n(789.46, 791.56)  And so let's ask God for the grace\n(791.56, 793.74)  to prepare for this Eucharist well,\n(793.74, 796.66)  as we make our petitions known to our Heavenly Father.\n(799.74, 803.42)  We pray for Pope Leo and for Bishop Richard Henning,\n(803.42, 805.46)  and for all bishops throughout the church.\n(805.46, 808.98)  May God give them the grace to be true shepherds of souls,\n(808.98, 811.06)  so all can come to know the love of Christ.\n(811.06, 812.3)  We pray to the Lord.\n(814.1, 815.98)  We pray for all civil leaders, governments,\n(815.98, 817.86)  and elected officials throughout the world.\n(817.86, 820.54)  May they enact policies that protect the church\n(820.54, 822.26)  and give her the freedom to be herself\n(822.26, 824.02)  so the kingdom of God can be spread\n(824.02, 825.3)  to every corner of the globe.\n(825.3, 826.54)  We pray to the Lord.\n(827.98, 829.78)  We pray for an increase of vocations\n(829.78, 831.62)  to the priesthood and to the religious life,\n(831.62, 833.78)  especially for members from our own parishes\n(833.78, 835.1)  and our own families.\n(835.1, 836.38)  We pray to the Lord.\n(837.9, 836.38) \n(843.58, 848.14)  and we pray for our beloved dead especially for Richard Robinson for whom this mass is offered through the mercy of God and with the help of our prayers may he come to see Christ face to\n(848.14, 854.86)  face we pray to the Lord heavenly father we make these prayers with great confidence as we ask them\n(854.86, 859.26)  through the intercession of Mary queen of the rosary and gate of heaven and we speak them in\n(859.26, 862.66)  in the name of Jesus, her son, who is Lord forever and ever.\n(919.26, 948.58)  Pray, brothers and sisters, that my sacrifice and yours\n(948.58, 951.08)  may be acceptable to God, the almighty Father.\n(960.06, 963.9)  Receive, O Lord, we pray, the offerings placed on your altar\n(963.9, 966.98)  in commemoration of blessed Charbel,\n(966.98, 968.92)  so that as you brought him glory,\n(968.92, 971.14)  you may through these sacred mysteries\n(971.14, 974.14)  grant to us your pardon through Christ our Lord.\n(975.94, 977.22)  The Lord be with you.\n(978.3, 977.22) \n(985.66, 989.54)  lift up your hearts. Let us give thanks to the Lord our God. It is truly right and just our duty and our salvation always and everywhere to give you\n(989.54, 994.94)  thanks, Lord Holy Father Almighty and eternal God through Christ our Lord. For as on\n(994.94, 998.94)  the festival of Saint Charbel you bid your church rejoice, so too you\n(998.94, 1002.9)  strengthen her by the example of his holy life, teach her by his words of\n(1002.9, 1007.62)  preaching, and keep her safe in answer to his prayers. And so with the company of\n(1007.62, 1012.62)  angels and saints, we sing the hymn of your praise, as without end we acclaim.\n(1012.62, 1019.88)  Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts, heaven and earth are full of your glory.\n(1019.88, 1025.06)  Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.\n(1025.06, 1032.18)  Hosanna in the highest. You are indeed holy, O Lord, and all you have created\n(1032.18, 1037.62)  it rightly gives you praise for through your son our lord jesus christ by the power and working of\n(1037.62, 1042.9)  the holy spirit you give life to all things and make them holy and you never cease to gather a\n(1042.9, 1049.06)  people to yourself so that from the rising of the sun to its setting a pure sacrifice may be offered\n(1049.06, 1055.62)  to your name therefore oh lord we humbly implore you by the same spirit graciously make holy these\n(1055.62, 1061.46)  gifts we have brought to you for consecration that they may become the body and blood of your\n(1061.46, 1066.18)  Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, at whose command we celebrate these mysteries.\n(1066.9, 1074.02)  For on the night he was betrayed, he himself took bread, and giving you thanks, he said the blessing,\n(1074.02, 1082.42)  broke the bread, and gave it to his disciples, saying, Take this, all of you, and eat of it,\n(1082.98, 1087.86)  for this is my body, which will be given up for you.\n(1091.46, 1107.8)  in a similar way when supper was ended he took the chalice and giving you\n(1107.8, 1114.02)  thanks he said the blessed and gave the chalice to his disciples saying take\n(1114.02, 1121.4)  this all of you and drink from it for this is the chalice of my blood the\n(1121.4, 1123.92)  the blood of the new and eternal covenant,\n(1123.92, 1126.28)  which will be poured out for you and for many\n(1126.28, 1128.66)  for the forgiveness of sins.\n(1128.66, 1131.22)  Do this in memory of me.\n(1133.78, 1138.78)  The mystery of faith, save us, savior of the world,\n(1149.62, 1138.78) \n(1152.0, 1153.88)  The mystery of faith, save us, savior of the world, for by your cross and resurrection you have set us free.\n(1153.88, 1159.2)  Therefore, O Lord, as we celebrate the memorial of the saving passion of your son, his wondrous\n(1159.2, 1163.76)  resurrection and ascension into heaven, and as we look forward to his second coming, we\n(1163.76, 1167.2)  offer you in thanksgiving this holy and living sacrifice.\n(1167.2, 1171.9)  we pray upon the oblation of your Church, and recognizing the sacrificial victim by\n(1171.9, 1176.62)  whose death you willed to reconcile us to yourself. Granted, we who are nourished by\n(1176.62, 1181.46)  the body and blood of your Son, and filled with his Holy Spirit, may become one body,\n(1181.46, 1186.58)  one spirit in Christ. May he make of us an eternal offering to you, so that we may obtain\n(1186.58, 1190.68)  an inheritance with your elect, especially with the most blessed Virgin Mary, Mother\n(1190.68, 1195.9)  of God, with blessed Joseph, her spouse, with your blessed apostles and glorious martyrs,\n(1195.9, 1201.1)  with Saint Charvel, and with all the Saints. On this constant intersection in your presence,\n(1201.1, 1207.34)  we rely for unfailing help. May this sacrifice of our reconciliation, we pray, O Lord, advance the\n(1207.34, 1212.06)  peace and salvation of all the world. Be pleased to confirm in faith and charity your pilgrim\n(1212.06, 1217.66)  church on earth, with your servant Leo, our pope, and Richard, our bishop, the order of bishops,\n(1217.66, 1222.7)  all the clergy, and the entire people you have gained for your own. Listen graciously to the\n(1222.7, 1226.78)  the prayers of this family whom you have summoned before you and your\n(1226.78, 1231.16)  compassionate merciful father gather to yourself all your children scattered\n(1231.16, 1235.4)  throughout the world to our departed brothers and sisters and to all who are\n(1235.4, 1239.08)  pleasing to you at their passing from this light give kind admittance to your\n(1239.08, 1243.28)  kingdom there we hope to enjoy forever the fullness of your glory through\n(1243.28, 1251.62)  Christ our Lord through whom you be so on the world all that is good through\n(1251.62, 1256.46)  him and with him and in him, O God Almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy\n(1256.46, 1265.1)  Spirit all glory and honor is yours forever and ever. At the Savior's command\n(1265.1, 1272.38)  informed by divine teaching we dare to say our Father who art in heaven hallowed\n(1272.38, 1278.74)  be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven give\n(1278.74, 1285.46)  us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass\n(1285.46, 1292.98)  against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil deliver us lord we pray from\n(1292.98, 1298.58)  every evil graciously grant peace in our days that by the help of your mercy we may be always free\n(1298.58, 1304.18)  from sin and safe from all distress as we await the blessed hope and the coming of our savior\n(1304.18, 1313.3)  Jesus Christ Lord Jesus Christ who said to your apostles peace I leave you my\n(1313.3, 1317.02)  peace I give you look not in our sins but on the faith of your church and\n(1317.02, 1320.98)  graciously grant her peace and unity in accordance with your will who live and\n(1320.98, 1326.62)  reign forever and ever the peace of the Lord be with you always let us offer\n(1326.62, 1335.18)  each other the sign of peace. Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world,\n(1335.18, 1341.54)  have mercy on us. Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on\n(1341.54, 1348.94)  us. Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, grant us peace.\n(1356.62, 1369.42)  Behold the Lamb of God, behold him who takes away the sins of the world.\n(1369.42, 1371.58)  Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb.\n(1371.58, 1377.58)  Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof, but only say the word and my\n(1377.58, 1384.58)  soul shall be healed.\n(1407.58, 1423.22)  Blessed is the servant whom the Lord finds watching, and when he comes, amen, I say to\n(1423.22, 1435.74)  you, he will put that servant in charge of all his property.\n(1615.74, 1644.18)  Let us pray.\n(1644.18, 1647.26)  may partaking at the heavenly table, almighty God,\n(1647.26, 1649.96)  confirm and increase strength from on high\n(1649.96, 1653.62)  and all who celebrate the feast day of blessed Charbel,\n(1653.62, 1657.04)  that we may preserve in integrity the gift of faith\n(1657.04, 1660.66)  and walk in the path of salvation you trace for us\n(1660.66, 1662.82)  through Christ our Lord.\n(1662.82, 1666.66)  The Lord be with you, may almighty God bless you,\n(1666.66, 1670.22)  the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.\n(1670.22, 1671.98)  Go forth, the mass is ended.\n(1674.18, 1678.14)  St. Michael the Archangel, defend us in battle, be our protector.\n",

        "transcript": "(239.0, 246.0)  Okay, so we're going to go ahead and take a few more minutes, and then we're going to\n(269.0, 276.22)  I will look after my sheeps as the Lord, and I will appoint a shepherd to pastor them,\n(276.22, 278.42)  and I the Lord will be their God.\n(278.42, 281.9)  In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, amen.\n(281.9, 284.46)  The Lord be with you.\n(284.46, 288.28)  Today's Mass is offered for our parishioners and we celebrate the feast of Saint Peter\n(288.28, 290.12)  Chrysologus Bishop.\n(290.12, 294.8)  My brothers and sisters, let us acknowledge our sins and so prepare ourselves to celebrate\n(294.8, 298.18)  the sacred mysteries.\n(298.18, 304.86)  I confess to almighty God and to you, my brothers and sisters, that I have greatly sinned in\n(304.86, 310.24)  my thoughts and in my words in what I have done and what I have failed to do through\n(310.24, 314.9)  my fault, through my fault, through my most grievous fault.\n(314.9, 320.26)  Therefore I ask the blessed Mary of a virgin, all the angels and saints, and you, my brothers\n(320.26, 324.06)  and sisters, to pray for me to the Lord our God.\n(324.06, 326.14)  May almighty God have mercy on us.\n(326.14, 333.9)  us our sins and bring us to everlasting life. Lord have mercy. Christ have mercy.\n(333.9, 342.84)  Lord have mercy. Let us pray. Oh God who made the Bishop St. Peter\n(342.84, 347.2)  Chrysologus an outstanding preacher of your incarnate word, grant through his\n(347.2, 351.68)  intercession that we may constantly ponder in our hearts the mysteries of\n(351.68, 357.32)  your salvation, and faithfully express them in what we do, through our Lord Jesus Christ\n(357.32, 362.22)  your Son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God forever\n(362.22, 381.34)  for her endeavor.\n(381.44, 386.28)  A reading from the Book of Exodus.\n(386.34, 388.34)  As Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of\n(388.42, 390.34)  the commandments in his hands, he did not know that the skin on\n(390.42, 390.34) \n(395.64, 397.28)  face, had become radiant while he was conversing with the Lord.\n(397.28, 399.28)  When Aaron then and the other\n(399.28, 401.28)  children of Israel saw Moses and\n(401.28, 403.28)  noticed how radiant the skin of\n(403.28, 405.28)  his face had become, they were\n(405.28, 407.28)  afraid to come near him.\n(407.28, 409.28)  Only after Moses called to them\n(409.28, 411.28)  did Aaron and the other rulers\n(411.28, 412.28)  of the community come back to\n(412.28, 414.28)  him.\n(414.28, 415.28)  Moses then spoke to them.\n(415.28, 417.28)  Later on, all the children of\n(417.28, 419.28)  Israel came up to him, and he\n(419.28, 420.28)  enjoined on them all that the\n(420.28, 425.08)  When he finished speaking with\n(448.9, 425.08) \n(428.78, 432.08)  Whenever Moses entered the presence of the Lord to converse with him,\n(432.08, 435.08)  he removed the veil until he came back out again.\n(435.08, 438.08)  On coming out, he would tell the children of Israel\n(438.08, 440.08)  all that had been commanded.\n(440.08, 442.08)  Then the children of Israel would see\n(442.08, 446.08)  that the skin on Moses' face was radiant,\n(446.08, 449.08)  so he would again put the veil over his face\n(449.08, 452.08)  until he went up to converse with the Lord.\n(452.08, 453.08)  The word of the Lord.\n(453.08, 458.08)  Holy is the Lord, our God.\n(458.08, 463.42)  Exhale to the Lord, our God,\n(463.42, 466.42)  in worship at his footstool.\n(466.42, 467.42)  Holy is he.\n(467.42, 468.42)  Holy is the Lord, our God.\n(468.42, 469.42)  Moses and Aaron were among his priests,\n(469.42, 472.86)  and Samuel among those who called upon his name.\n(472.86, 476.5)  He came upon the Lord and he answered them.\n(476.5, 478.7)  Holy is the Lord, our God.\n(478.7, 481.5)  From the pillar of cloud he spoke to them.\n(481.5, 488.3)  They heard his decrees\n(509.86, 488.3) \n(491.4, 511.46)  the Lord, our God, in worship at his holy mountain.\n(518.3, 523.9)  Jesus said to his disciples the kingdom of heaven is like a treasure buried in a\n(523.9, 529.3)  field which a person finds and hides again and out of joy goes and sells all\n(529.3, 534.02)  that he has and buys that field again the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant\n(534.02, 539.86)  searching for fine pearls when he finds a pearl of great price he goes and sells\n(539.86, 545.22)  all that he has and buys it the gospel of the Lord\n(548.3, 558.3)  In my final year of Little League, I couldn't buy a hit, and I became obsessed with if I had the right bat, I would all of a sudden be able to hit the ball.\n(558.3, 567.3)  And it didn't work, but I was so dedicated to buying this bat that I really wanted. I started watering all of the neighbors' flowers.\n(567.3, 577.3)  I'm not a very big pet person. I even was willing to walk dogs, take care of cats, and I tried to even convince my sister to give me a loan to buy this bat.\n(577.3, 583.18)  bat and I did get the bat I didn't really get any hits with the bat but I'm\n(583.18, 588.62)  sharing all this with you because I became so fixated on getting this item\n(588.62, 595.38)  and Jesus says that the kingdom of heaven is like a treasure and so often I\n(595.38, 600.66)  don't think we think of the kingdom of God living in our souls as that treasure\n(600.66, 608.02)  Jesus says we have to pay to purchase this. We have to be willing to sacrifice\n(608.02, 614.5)  and sell things in order to remain a friend of Christ. Of course he's talking\n(614.5, 619.82)  about the certain sins and vices we have, but even smaller things like grudges and\n(619.82, 625.06)  resentments or certain habits, maybe sometimes the people we spend most of\n(625.06, 632.62)  our time with because if we really knew the gift of God, as Jesus says with joy\n(632.62, 639.98)  we would go and sell it what we need to buy this pearl of great price. And so the\n(639.98, 647.18)  source of reflection for us today is have I sold anything to remain a friend\n(647.18, 652.9)  of Christ or do I just kind of see my relationship with God as I come and I go\n(652.9, 658.78)  to mass, which is a beautiful thing, and then I really have my life. But to be in\n(658.78, 664.9)  his kingdom means everything belongs to him. And so just a final bit of thought\n(664.9, 672.82)  is how much time do we spend with God or thinking about God outside of church? Do\n(672.82, 679.56)  we pray? Do we talk about him? Do we share the joys of this kingdom? The feast we\n(679.56, 684.32)  We celebrate today St. Peter Chrysologus, who was a bishop in the 5th century.\n(684.32, 689.72)  He had this awakening in his own soul, and so he gave his whole life to convincing people\n(689.72, 695.32)  that living for God's kingdom was worth any price, and so let us ask for his intercession\n(695.32, 700.8)  as we make our prayers known to our Heavenly Father.\n(700.8, 704.52)  We pray for Pope Leo and for Bishop Richard Henning and for all bishops throughout the\n(704.52, 709.32)  church. May God give them the grace to be true shepherds of souls who model for\n(709.32, 713.2)  us their flock that living in the kingdom of God is worth any price. We\n(713.2, 718.48)  pray to the Lord. We pray for all civil leaders, governments, and elected\n(718.48, 722.0)  officials throughout the world. May they enact policies that protect the church\n(722.0, 726.04)  and give her the freedom to be herself so the kingdom of God can be spread to\n(726.04, 731.32)  every corner of the globe. We pray to the Lord. We pray for an increase of\n(731.32, 735.16)  vocations to the priesthood into the religious life, especially from members\n(735.16, 740.24)  from our own parishes and our own families, we pray to the Lord. And we\n(740.24, 745.72)  pray for our parishioners for whom this mass is offered, we pray to the Lord.\n(745.72, 750.24)  Heavenly Father, we make these prayers with great confidence as we ask them\n(750.24, 754.0)  through the intercession of Saint Peter, Chrysologus, and Mary, our Morning Star\n(754.0, 758.0)  and Gate of Heaven, and we speak them in the name of Jesus, her Son, who is Lord\n(758.0, 760.0)  forward forever and ever.\n(818.0, 847.0)  So, thank you very much for joining us today, and we'll be getting started in just a moment.\n(847.0, 853.0)  Pray, brothers and sisters, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God, the Almighty Father.\n(861.0, 868.0)  Look with favor, O Lord, we pray, on the offerings we set upon this sacred altar, on the feast day of blessed Peter Chrysologus,\n(869.0, 876.0)  that bestowing on us your pardon, our oblations may give honor to your name, through Christ our Lord.\n(877.0, 890.28)  The Lord be with you, lift up your hearts, let us give thanks to the Lord our God.\n(890.28, 894.6)  It is truly right and just our duty and our salvation always and everywhere to give you\n(894.6, 895.6)  thanks.\n(895.6, 899.84)  Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God, for you are praised in the company of your\n(899.84, 904.88)  saints and in crowning their merits you crown your own gifts, by their way of life you offer\n(904.88, 909.8)  us an example, by a communion with them you give us companionship, by their\n(909.8, 913.84)  intercession, sure support, so that encouraged by so great a cloud of\n(913.84, 919.24)  witnesses, we may run as victors in the race before us, and win with\n(919.24, 923.48)  them the imperishable crown of glory through Christ our Lord. And so with the\n(923.48, 927.8)  angels and archangels, and with a great multitude of the saints, we sing the hymn\n(927.8, 935.9)  of your praise, as without end we acclaim. Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts, heaven\n(935.9, 941.94)  and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he who comes in\n(941.94, 949.7)  the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest. You are indeed holy, O Lord, and all you have\n(949.7, 955.06)  created rightly gives you praise. For through your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, by the power\n(955.06, 959.02)  in working of the Holy Spirit, you give life to all things and make them holy,\n(959.02, 963.58)  and you never cease to gather a people to yourself, so that from the rising of\n(963.58, 969.1)  the sun to its setting, a pure sacrifice may be offered to your name. Therefore, O\n(969.1, 973.94)  Lord, we humbly implore you, by the same Spirit graciously make holy these gifts\n(973.94, 978.06)  we have brought to you for consecration, that they may become the body and blood\n(978.06, 983.14)  of your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, at whose command we celebrate these\n(983.14, 988.7)  mysteries for on the night he was betrayed he himself took bread and\n(988.7, 993.42)  giving you thanks he said the blessing broke the bread and gave it to his\n(993.42, 1003.38)  disciples saying take this all of you and eat of it for this is my body which\n(1003.38, 1007.26)  will be given up for you\n(1013.14, 1023.46)  In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took the chalice, and giving you thanks he\n(1023.46, 1028.18)  said the blessing, and gave the chalice to his disciples, saying,\n(1028.18, 1036.54)  Take this, all of you, and drink from it, for this is the chalice of my blood, the blood\n(1036.54, 1041.34)  of the new and eternal covenant, which will be poured out for you and for many for the\n(1041.34, 1047.76)  forgiveness of sins. Do this in memory of me.\n(1060.88, 1067.16)  The mystery of faith. Save us, Savior of the world, for by your cross and\n(1067.16, 1072.02)  resurrection, you have set us free. Therefore, O Lord, as we celebrate the\n(1072.02, 1075.76)  memorial of the saving passion of your Son, his wondrous resurrection and\n(1075.76, 1079.64)  ascension into heaven, and as we look forward to his second coming, we offer\n(1079.64, 1083.64)  you in thanksgiving this holy and living sacrifice. Look, we pray, upon the\n(1083.64, 1087.88)  oblation of your Church, in recognizing the sacrificial victim by whose death\n(1087.88, 1092.12)  you will to reconcile us to yourself. Grant that we who are nourished by the\n(1092.12, 1096.24)  body and blood of your Son, and filled with his Holy Spirit, may become one body,\n(1096.24, 1101.2)  one Spirit in Christ, may he make of us an eternal offering to you, so that we\n(1101.2, 1104.72)  may obtain an inheritance with your elect, especially with the most blessed\n(1104.72, 1109.44)  Virgin Mary, Mother of God, with blessed Joseph, her spouse, with your blessed\n(1109.44, 1113.84)  apostles and glorious martyrs, with St. Peter Chrysologus, and with all the\n(1113.84, 1118.52)  Saints, on whose constant intercession in your presence we rely for unfailing help.\n(1118.52, 1123.64)  May this sacrifice of our reconciliation, we pray, O Lord, advance the peace and\n(1123.64, 1130.68)  salvation of all the world. Be pleased to confirm in faith and charity your pilgrim church hunter with your servant Leo our Pope and\n(1130.88, 1136.2)  Richard our Bishop, the order of bishops, all the clergy, and the entire people you have gained for your own.\n(1137.44, 1144.0)  Listen graciously to the prayers of this family whom you have summoned before you and your compassion and merciful Father.\n(1144.32, 1147.4)  Gather to yourself all your children scattered throughout the world,\n(1147.62, 1152.76)  to our departed brothers and sisters, and to all who are pleasing to you at their passing from this life.\n(1153.08, 1152.76) \n(1156.96, 1160.68)  give kind admittance to your kingdom there we hope to enjoy forever the fullness of your glory through Christ our Lord through whom you bestow on the\n(1160.68, 1168.68)  world all that is good through him and with him and in him Oh God Almighty\n(1168.68, 1174.04)  Father in the unity of the Holy Spirit all glory and honor is yours forever\n(1174.04, 1182.28)  and ever. At the Savior's command and formed by divine teaching we dare to say\n(1182.28, 1189.16)  our Father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be\n(1189.16, 1195.32)  done on earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us\n(1195.32, 1201.2)  our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us and lead us not into\n(1201.2, 1207.4)  into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil.\n(1207.4, 1211.52)  Graciously grant peace in our days, that by the help of your mercy we may be always free\n(1211.52, 1216.4)  from sin, and safe from all distress, as we await the blessed hope and the coming of our\n(1216.4, 1225.0)  Savior, Jesus Christ. Lord Jesus Christ, who said to your apostles,\n(1225.0, 1228.8)  peace I leave you, my peace I give you. Look not on our sins, but on the faith of your\n(1228.8, 1232.5)  church and graciously grant her peace and unity in accordance with your will\n(1232.5, 1238.86)  who live and reign forever and ever. The peace of the Lord be with you always. Let\n(1238.86, 1242.4)  us offer each other the sign of peace.\n(1242.88, 1249.72)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us. Lamb of God,\n(1249.72, 1255.92)  you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us. Lamb of God, you take away\n(1255.92, 1260.36)  the sins of the world. Grant us peace.\n(1273.28, 1278.44)  Behold the Lamb of God. Behold him who takes away the sins of the world.\n(1278.44, 1283.52)  Blessed are those called to the Supper of the Lamb. Lord, I am not worthy that\n(1283.52, 1288.24)  that you should enter under my roof but only say the word and my soul shall be\n(1288.24, 1290.68)  healed.\n(1313.52, 1342.52)  Blessed is the servant whom his Lord finds awake when he comes and knocks at the gate.\n(1460.52, 1467.52)  So, thank you very much for your attention, and I'll see you in the next session.\n(1520.52, 1547.58)  Let us pray.\n(1547.58, 1552.5)  Renewed by the sacred mysteries, we humbly pray, O Lord, that following the example of\n(1552.5, 1558.24)  Blessed Peter Chrysologus, we may strive to profess what he believed, and to practice\n(1558.24, 1561.78)  what he taught, through Christ our Lord.\n(1561.78, 1564.08)  The Lord be with you.\n(1564.08, 1569.36)  May Almighty God bless you, the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit.\n(1569.36, 1573.7)  Go forth, the Mass has ended.\n(1573.7, 1578.5)  Michael the Archangel defend us in battle be our protection against the\n(1578.5, 1583.84)  wickedness and snares of the devil may God rebuke him we humbly pray and do\n(1583.84, 1589.36)  thou the prince of the heavenly hosts by the power of God cast into hell Satan\n(1589.36, 1594.2)  and all the evil spirits who prowl about the world seeking the ruin of souls\n(1594.2, 1597.04)  amen\n",

From the fullness of the heart, the mouth speaks.\n(690.6, 695.6)  And that's very true of you and me in this day and age.\n(695.6, 703.6)  What we believe and what we live from our day-to-day existence\n(703.6, 710.6)  is very much reflected by the way we speak.\n(710.6, 716.6)  If we understand, for instance, that we should love our neighbor,\n(716.6, 722.6)  then from our heart we are going to be kind to that neighbor.\n(722.6, 725.6)  We're not going to speak against them.\n(725.6, 732.6)  We're not going to sound off against people who perhaps have caused some misfortune for us.\n(732.6, 744.6)  I often think of the response that we could make when people have something unkind to\n(744.6, 747.74)  say to us.\n(747.74, 753.24)  I bite my tongue rather than doing that, and I hope you do too.\n(753.24, 758.84)  I'd like to say the same to you and more of it, but that's not really the way we should\n(758.84, 760.62)  react.\n(760.62, 767.58)  We should think in terms of the fact that the person who upsets us by what they say\n(767.58, 775.46)  or what they do, or some unkindness that we've experienced, can be offered to God in a sense,\n(775.46, 784.4)  and certainly from the fullness of our heart, our mouth will speak.\n(784.4, 790.76)  We pray today for our deceased loved ones, our benefactors, relatives and friends, those\n(790.76, 796.04)  who have been good to us and good to our parish through the years, and particularly we pray\n(796.04, 802.48)  for all our parishioners for whom we offer this Mass this morning, let us pray to the\n(802.48, 803.48)  Lord.\n(803.48, 810.36)  For the sick and the suffering and the dying throughout the world and those suffering from\n(810.36, 817.36)  all the effects of poverty, tragedy, hunger, homelessness, and war in the troubled parts\n(818.28, 825.28)  of our world, let us pray to the Lord. For the people who are sick locally, our fellow\n(826.62, 832.86)  parishioners, known to us or unknown to us, who were shot up in their own homes, or in\n(832.86, 839.86)  the hospitals, or in the nursing homes nearby, for all of these our brothers and sisters\n(839.86, 845.0)  in Christ, let us pray to the Lord.\n(845.0, 850.6)  For those for whom we have been asked to pray and may have forgotten to do so, or those\n(850.6, 858.44)  who have no one else to pray for them except us, let us pray to the Lord.\n(858.44, 865.76)  And for all our own personal needs and intentions today, let us pray to the Lord.\n(865.76, 872.64)  O God, we ask You to hear these petitions and requests of ours, and to grant them if\n(872.64, 874.64)  it is Your will.\n(874.64, 875.4)  We ask all...\n",

Oh Lord my God\n(399.88, 403.32)  The soul is thirsting for you. Oh Lord my God. Oh\n(403.88, 411.24)  God you are my God whom I seek for you are my flesh pines and my soul thirsts like the earth parched\n(411.76, 418.7)  lifeless, and without water.\n(434.98, 418.7) \n(424.4, 447.72)  Thus have I gazed toward you\n(424.4, 429.84)  For your kindness is a\n(454.0, 429.84) \n(433.62, 436.08)  My soul is thirsty for you, O Lord, my God. Thus will I bless you while I live.\n(436.08, 439.44)  Lifting up my hands, I will call upon your name.\n(439.44, 441.28)  As with the riches of the banquet,\n(441.28, 443.4)  shall my soul be satisfied.\n(443.4, 447.24)  And with exuberant lips, my mouth shall praise you.\n(447.24, 450.48)  My soul is thirsty for you, O Lord, my God.\n(451.36, 454.72)  You are my help, and in the shadow of your wings,\n(454.72, 456.28)  I shall for joy.\n(456.28, 458.5)  My soul clings fast to you.\n(458.5, 461.22)  Your right hand upholds me.\n(461.22, 464.26)  My soul is thirsting for you, O Lord, my God.\n(485.76, 464.26) \n(486.02, 488.96)  Amen. The Lord be with you.\n(488.96, 492.96)  A reading from the Holy Gospel according to John.\n(494.26, 500.42)  On the first day of the week Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early in the\n(500.42, 508.06)  morning while it was still dark and saw the stone removed from the tomb. So she\n(508.06, 513.98)  ran and went to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved and told\n(513.98, 519.82)  them they have taken the Lord from the tomb and we do not know where they put\n(519.82, 528.56)  him. Mary stayed outside the tomb weeping and as she wept she bent over into the\n(528.56, 534.14)  tomb and saw two angels in white sitting there one at the head and one at the\n(534.14, 540.84)  feet where the body of Jesus had been and they said to her woman why are you\n(540.84, 546.82)  weeping she said to them they have taken the Lord and I don't know where they\n(546.82, 553.26)  laid him. When she had said this she turned around and saw Jesus there but\n(553.26, 559.78)  did not know it was Jesus. Jesus said to her, woman why are you weeping? Whom are\n(559.78, 565.7)  you looking for? She thought it was the gardener and said to him, sir if you\n(565.7, 571.78)  carried him away tell me where you laid him and I will take him. Jesus said to\n(571.78, 581.3)  to her, Mary. She turned and said to him in Hebrew Rabboni which means teacher.\n(581.3, 587.06)  Jesus said to her stop holding on to me for I have not yet ascended to the\n(587.06, 593.14)  Father but go to my brothers and tell them I am going to my father and your\n(593.14, 599.42)  father to my God and your God. Mary Magdalene went and announced to the\n(599.42, 607.34)  disciples I have seen the Lord and then reported what he told her the gospel of\n(607.34, 618.5)  the Lord as we celebrate the feast of Saint Mary Magdalene the first witness\n(618.5, 623.1)  to the resurrection and the one whom Jesus lovingly calls by name in that\n(623.1, 628.9)  gospel today Mary comes to the tomb and sorrow she believes Jesus his body has\n(628.9, 635.02)  been taken even when she sees angels and even Jesus himself. She doesn't recognize\n(635.02, 644.42)  him. It's only when he says her name, Mary, that everything changes. At that\n(644.42, 649.1)  moment her grief of course turns to joy. She sees him for who he is,\n(649.1, 659.08)  risen, alive, and full of love. Mary, who was a woman considered unclean, is now\n(659.08, 664.96)  entrusted with the greatest message ever proclaimed. He is risen.\n(664.96, 671.8)  St. Thomas Aquinas would later call her the Apostle to the Apostles. She is the\n(671.8, 678.52)  first evangelist of the resurrection. Think about that. God chose her, someone\n(678.52, 687.24)  most people had written off, not a priest, not a leader, a woman with a messy past even,\n(687.24, 692.5)  and she becomes the first evangelist.\n(692.5, 698.42)  We cannot overlook how radical this was.\n(698.42, 705.9)  In a time when women's voices were often dismissed, Jesus chooses Mary Magdalene to bear the news\n(705.9, 713.66)  eternal life. And her witness reminds us that God often chooses the unexpected to\n(713.66, 720.74)  carry his glory. It reminds us too, I think, that no one is too broken to be\n(720.74, 727.7)  called, no one is too small to be sent. Like Mary Magdalene, may we seek the Lord\n(727.7, 732.5)  with love, listen for his voice and go forth and tell the world I have seen the\n(732.5, 739.38)  Lord when he sends you whether it's in your job or your relationships or some\n(739.38, 744.34)  new beginning in your life go with the confidence of Mary Magdalene and\n(744.34, 754.92)  proclaim by your words and actions by your lives I have seen the Lord let us\n(754.92, 762.42)  pray in conscious of God's merciful love for us we present him with our prayers\n(762.42, 765.84)  and we pray for church leaders and missionaries.\n(765.84, 768.18)  May God make them fearless witnesses\n(768.18, 771.62)  in proclaiming Jesus's resurrection from the dead.\n(771.62, 773.34)  We pray to the Lord.\n(775.18, 778.42)  For all nations, may God inspire those in power\n(778.42, 780.02)  to govern justly.\n(780.02, 781.8)  We pray to the Lord.\n(783.86, 786.38)  For all those whose lives are threatened\n(786.38, 790.8)  or disrupted by war or other forms of violence,\n(790.8, 793.9)  may the Lord help them find safety and peace,\n(793.9, 795.6)  we pray to the Lord.\n(797.66, 799.86)  For all in our faith community,\n(799.86, 803.06)  may God sanctify us in our witness to him,\n(803.06, 804.78)  we pray to the Lord.\n(806.54, 809.14)  For all the sick that God's healing presence\n(809.14, 811.72)  may be with them, we pray to the Lord.\n(813.7, 815.06)  And for our beloved dead,\n(815.06, 817.46)  and today we remember Patrick Lyons\n(817.46, 819.7)  for whom this mass is offered,\n(819.7, 822.22)  May they who lived in Christ in this life\n(822.22, 825.8)  soon see the resurrected Jesus face to face.\n(825.8, 827.58)  We pray to the Lord.\n(829.14, 832.3)  Merciful Father, we entrust these prayers to your care.\n(832.3, 834.82)  We ask them through Christ our Lord.\n(849.7, 874.02)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through your goodness we have received\n(874.02, 878.18)  the bread we offer you, fruit of the earth and work of human hands.\n(878.18, 883.26)  It will become for us the bread of life.\n(883.26, 887.54)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through your goodness we have received\n(887.54, 891.46)  the wine we offer you, fruit of the vine and work of human hands.\n(891.46, 907.22)  It will become our spiritual drink.\n(907.22, 913.06)  Pray, brothers and sisters, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God, the Almighty\n(913.06, 924.06)  Father.\n(924.06, 929.78)  Accept, O Lord, the offerings presented in commemoration of St. Mary Magdalene, whose\n(929.78, 935.84)  homage of charity was graciously accepted by her Only Begotten Son, who lives and reigns\n(935.84, 944.96)  forever and ever. The Lord be with you. Lift up your hearts. Let us give thanks\n(944.96, 951.8)  to the Lord our God. It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,\n(951.8, 956.92)  always and everywhere to give you thanks, Lord, Holy Father, Almighty and Eternal\n(956.92, 963.32)  God, through Christ our Lord. For in the marvelous confession of your saints, you\n(963.32, 969.02)  You make your church fruitful with strength ever new, and offer us a sure sign of your\n(969.02, 970.44)  love.\n(970.44, 976.02)  And that your saving mysteries may be fulfilled, their great example lends us courage, their\n(976.02, 979.74)  fervent prayers sustain us in all we do.\n(979.74, 984.86)  And so, Lord, with all the angels and saints, we too give you thanks as an exaltation we\n(984.86, 986.86)  now acclaim.\n(986.86, 994.24)  Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts, heaven and earth are full of your glory, Hosanna\n(994.24, 996.24)  in the highest.\n(996.24, 1003.72)  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, Hosanna in the highest.\n(1003.72, 1007.3)  You are indeed holy, O Lord, the fount of all holiness.\n(1007.3, 1012.66)  Make holy, therefore, these gifts, we pray, by sending down your Spirit upon them like\n(1012.66, 1019.98)  the dewfall, so that they may become for us the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.\n(1019.98, 1026.26)  At the time he was betrayed and entered willingly into his passion, he took bread and, giving\n(1026.26, 1032.22)  thanks, broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying, Take this, all of you, and eat of\n(1032.22, 1046.3)  it for this is my body which will be given up for you in a similar way when\n(1046.3, 1050.76)  supper was ended he took the chalice and once more giving thanks he gave it to\n(1050.76, 1056.08)  his disciples saying take this all of you and drink from it for this is the\n(1056.08, 1060.66)  chalice of my blood the blood of the new and eternal covenant which will be\n(1060.66, 1065.98)  poured out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Do this in memory of\n(1065.98, 1081.54)  me. The mystery of faith, when we eat this bread and drink this cup, we proclaim\n(1081.54, 1087.78)  your death, O Lord, until you come again. Therefore, as we celebrate the memorial\n(1087.78, 1091.62)  of his death and resurrection we offer you Lord the bread of life and the\n(1091.62, 1096.9)  chalice of salvation giving thanks that you have held us worthy to be in your\n(1096.9, 1102.3)  presence and minister to you humbly we pray that partaking of the body and\n(1102.3, 1108.34)  blood of Christ we may be gathered into one by the Holy Spirit remember Lord\n(1108.34, 1113.06)  your church spread throughout the world and bring her to the fullness of charity\n(1113.06, 1119.28)  together with Leo our Pope and Richard our Bishop and all the clergy. Remember\n(1119.28, 1123.12)  also our brothers and sisters who have fallen asleep in the hope of the\n(1123.12, 1128.64)  resurrection and all who have died in your mercy welcome them into the light\n(1128.64, 1134.36)  of your face and have mercy on us all we pray that with the Blessed Virgin Mary\n(1134.36, 1140.24)  Mother of God Saint Joseph her spouse with the blessed apostles Saint Mary\n(1140.24, 1144.96)  Magdalene, St. Bridget, St. Augustine, and all the saints who have pleased you\n(1144.96, 1150.4)  throughout the ages that we may merit to be co-heirs to eternal life and may\n(1150.4, 1157.46)  praise and glorify you through your son Jesus Christ. Through him and with him\n(1157.46, 1162.68)  and in him, O God Almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all glory and\n(1162.68, 1167.28)  honor is yours forever and ever.\n(1168.96, 1167.28) \n(1174.76, 1179.16)  At the Savior's command and formed by divine teaching, we dare to pray now. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.\n(1179.16, 1184.64)  Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.\n(1184.64, 1191.24)  Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who\n(1191.24, 1196.08)  who trespass against us, and lead us not into temptation,\n(1196.08, 1198.48)  but deliver us from evil.\n(1198.48, 1201.24)  Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil.\n(1201.24, 1204.0)  Graciously grant peace in our days,\n(1204.0, 1206.12)  that by the help of your mercy,\n(1206.12, 1209.96)  we may be always free from sin and safe from all distress,\n(1209.96, 1211.46)  as we await the blessed hope\n(1211.46, 1214.5)  in the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ.\n(1214.5, 1216.8)  For the kingdom, the power, and the glory\n(1216.8, 1219.12)  are yours now and forever.\n(1219.12, 1222.08)  Lord Jesus Christ, who said to your apostles,\n(1222.08, 1224.68)  peace I leave you, my peace I give you.\n(1224.68, 1228.08)  Look not now on our sins, but on the faith of your church,\n(1228.08, 1230.48)  and graciously grant your peace and unity\n(1230.48, 1232.32)  in accordance with your will,\n(1232.32, 1235.44)  who live and reign forever and ever.\n(1235.44, 1238.32)  The peace of the Lord be with you always.\n(1238.32, 1239.16)  Amen.\n(1239.16, 1242.24)  Let's offer each other some sign of Christ's peace.\n(1249.12, 1265.84)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1265.84, 1271.3)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1271.3, 1279.08)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, grant us peace.\n(1279.08, 1285.04)  Behold the Lamb of God, behold Him who takes away the sins of the world, blessed are those\n(1285.04, 1287.56)  called to the Supper of the Lamb.\n(1287.56, 1293.24)  Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof, but only say the word and my\n(1293.24, 1295.24)  my soul shall be healed.\n(1323.24, 1330.24)  All right, everybody, we're going to take a short break, so we're going to take a short\n(1353.24, 1358.24)  All right, everybody, we're going to take a short break, and we're going to take a short\n(1358.24, 1359.24)  break.\n(1359.24, 1360.24)  We're going to take a short break, and we're going to take a short break, and we're going\n(1360.24, 1361.24)  to take a short break, and we're going to take a short break, and we're going to take\n(1361.24, 1362.24)  a short break, and we're going to take a short break, and we're going to take a short break,\n(1362.24, 1363.24)  and we're going to take a short break, and we're going to take a short break, and we're\n(1363.24, 1364.24)  going to take a short break, and we're going to take a short break, and we're going to\n(1364.24, 1365.24)  take a short break, and we're going to take a short break, and we're going to take a short\n(1365.24, 1366.24)  break, and we're going to take a short break, and we're going to take a short break, and\n(1366.24, 1367.24)  we're going to take a short break, and we're going to take a short break, and we're going\n(1367.24, 1368.24)  to take a short break, and we're going to take a short break, and we're going to take\n(1368.24, 1369.24)  a short break, and we're going to take a short break, and we're going to take a short break,\n(1369.24, 1370.24)  and we're going to take a short break, and we're going to take a short break, and we're\n(1370.24, 1371.24)  going to take a short break, and we're going to take a short break, and we're going to\n(1371.24, 1372.24)  take a short break, and we're going to take a short break, and we're going to take a\n(1372.24, 1373.24)  short break, and we're going to take a short break, and we're going to take a short break,\n(1373.24, 1374.24)  and we're going to take a short break, and we're going to take a short break, and\n(1374.24, 1375.24)  we're going to take a short break, and we're going to take a short break, and we're\n(1375.24, 1376.24)  going to take a short break, and we're going to take a short break, and we're\n(1496.24, 1525.56)  Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee, blessed art thou among women, and blessed\n(1525.56, 1531.92)  is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

Today we have a very special feast, Mary Magdalene,\n(323.76, 329.76)  and it's been upped from a memorial to a feast a few years ago by the Pope,\n(329.76, 337.76)  in recognition of Mary Magdalene's special, in fact, unique place in the history of salvation.\n(337.76, 343.76)  She is the apostle to the apostles, the one who told them of the resurrection,\n(343.76, 349.76)  and so we have great reason to be rejoicing for her.\n(349.76, 354.76)  Let us, as we begin, ask God for mercy.\n(360.76, 362.76)  Lord, have mercy.\n(362.76, 364.76)  Christ, have mercy.\n(364.76, 367.76)  Lord, have mercy.\n(367.76, 373.76)  May Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us our sins, and bring us to everlasting life.\n(373.76, 376.76)  Because this is a feast, we join in the glory.\n(376.76, 382.6)  Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to people of good will.\n(382.6, 387.4)  We praise you, we bless you, we adore you, we glorify you.\n(387.4, 393.84)  We give you thanks for your great glory, Lord God, Heavenly King, O God Almighty Father,\n(393.84, 400.44)  Lord Jesus Christ, Only Begotten Son, Lord God, Lamb of God, Son of the Father.\n(400.44, 404.44)  You take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(404.44, 408.56)  You take away the sins of the world, receive our prayer.\n(408.56, 413.04)  You are seated at the right hand of the Father, have mercy on us.\n(413.04, 418.36)  For you alone are the Holy One, you alone are the Lord, you alone are the Most High,\n(418.36, 427.44)  Jesus Christ, with the Holy Spirit, in the glory of God the Father, amen.\n(427.44, 441.44)  Let us pray.\n(441.44, 448.5)  Oh God, your only begotten Son entrusted Mary Magdalene before all others with announcing\n(448.5, 450.8)  the great joy of the resurrection.\n(450.8, 458.14)  Grant, we pray, that through her intercession and example, we may proclaim the living Christ\n(458.14, 464.28)  and come to see him reigning in your glory, who lives and reigns with you in the unity\n(464.28, 479.76)  of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.\n(479.76, 483.24)  A reading from the Song of Songs.\n(483.24, 487.04)  The bride says, on my bed at night,\n(487.04, 490.6)  I sought him whom my heart loves.\n(490.6, 494.16)  I sought him, but I did not find him.\n(494.16, 497.72)  I will rise then and go about the city.\n(497.72, 501.76)  In the streets and crossings, I will seek him\n(501.76, 504.32)  whom my heart loves.\n(504.32, 507.7)  I sought him, but I did not find him.\n(507.7, 513.22)  The watchmen came upon me as they made their rounds of the city.\n(513.22, 516.56)  Have you seen him whom my heart loves?\n(516.56, 523.14)  I had hardly left them when I found him whom my heart loves.\n(523.14, 524.66)  The word of the Lord.\n(524.66, 526.24)  Thanks be to God.\n(526.24, 530.7)  My soul is thirsting for you, O Lord my God.\n(530.7, 534.46)  My soul is thirsting for you, O Lord my God.\n(534.46, 541.86)  O God, you are my God whom I seek, for you my flesh pines and my soul thirsts,\n(541.86, 548.3)  like the urge, part, earth, parched, lifeless and without water.\n(548.3, 551.58)  My soul is thirsting for you, O Lord my God.\n(551.58, 558.06)  Thus have I gazed toward you in the sanctuary, to see your power and your glory,\n(558.06, 561.42)  For your kindness is a greater good than life.\n(561.42, 564.62)  My lips shall glorify you.\n(564.62, 568.34)  My soul is thirsting for you, O Lord my God.\n(568.34, 571.32)  Thus will I bless you while I live.\n(571.32, 575.42)  Lifting up my hands, I will call upon your name.\n(575.42, 582.78)  As with the riches of a banquet shall my soul be satisfied, and with exultant lips my mouth\n(582.78, 584.78)  shall praise you.\n(584.78, 588.62)  My soul is thirsting for you, O Lord my God.\n(588.62, 592.18)  You are my help, and in the shadow of your wings\n(592.18, 594.1)  I shout for joy.\n(594.1, 597.18)  My soul clings fast to you.\n(597.18, 600.36)  Your right hand upholds me.\n(600.36, 603.82)  My soul is thirsting for you, O Lord my God.\n(614.78, 631.86)  My friends, the Lord be with you.\n(631.86, 644.7)  A reading from the Holy Gospel according to Saint John.\n(644.7, 649.94)  On the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early in the morning, while\n(649.94, 655.14)  it was still dark, and saw the stone removed from the tomb.\n(655.14, 660.58)  So she ran and went to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved and told\n(660.58, 667.28)  them they have taken the Lord from the tomb and we don't know where they put him.\n(667.28, 674.5)  Mary stayed outside the tomb weeping, and as she wept, she bent over into the tomb and\n(674.5, 680.02)  and saw two angels in white, sitting there, one at the head and one at the feet, where\n(680.02, 683.62)  the body of Jesus had been.\n(683.62, 688.48)  And they said to her, Woman, why are you weeping?\n(688.48, 695.48)  She said to them, They have taken my Lord, and I don't know where they laid him.\n(695.48, 703.06)  When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus there, but did not know it was\n(703.06, 711.74)  Jesus Jesus said to Mary Magdalene woman why are you weeping whom are you looking\n(711.74, 719.26)  for she thought it was the gardener and said to him sir if you carried him away\n(719.26, 727.82)  tell me where you laid him and I will take him Jesus said to her Mary she\n(727.82, 734.18)  He turned and said to him in Hebrew Rabboni which means teacher.\n(734.18, 742.02)  Jesus said to her stop holding on to me for I have not yet ascended to my father but go\n(742.02, 748.54)  to my brothers and tell them I'm going to my father and your father to my God and your\n(748.54, 750.26)  God.\n(750.26, 757.5)  Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples I have seen the Lord and then reported what\n(757.5, 766.18)  he told her, the Gospel of the Lord.\n(766.18, 771.46)  The story of Mary Magdalene, especially as she's been honored down through the years,\n(771.46, 774.26)  has a few twists and turns.\n(774.26, 779.78)  The most important thing we can say about her is that she was close to Jesus and was\n(779.78, 787.74)  the announcer or the apostle with a small A of the news of the resurrection to the apostles,\n(787.74, 792.78)  the ones with capital A, the 12 apostles.\n(792.78, 799.54)  And what an honor that was for Mary to be singled out as the one to bring that news\n(799.54, 802.66)  even to the apostles.\n(802.66, 809.76)  But there's a little bit more to Mary's story than that, even though that's the key point.\n(809.76, 818.2)  Down through the ages, people tended to associate the same woman who was apostle to the apostles\n(818.2, 824.88)  with someone who had been a great sinner and whom Jesus had forgiven.\n(824.88, 832.9)  As people have done more study on that, they've come to see that she was a person who Jesus\n(832.9, 843.4)  relieved of demons, but she's not to be equated with the one who had greatly sinned.\n(843.4, 853.56)  And so when we think of Mary, we think of her as someone who is not so much sinner forgiven\n(853.56, 862.6)  as friend growing closer and closer, who was grateful for the freedom he gave her from\n(862.6, 869.28)  anything that would beset her as a problem, a challenge in her life.\n(869.28, 871.4)  And so the message for us is pretty clear.\n(871.4, 880.28)  We're called to be not exactly an apostle in the capital A sense, but apostolic.\n(880.28, 888.42)  We're called to be apostles in the sense of people sent by God to bring good news.\n(888.42, 893.22)  So we can all ask ourselves, when somebody thinks of me or thinks of you, do they think\n(893.22, 900.94)  of us primarily as people who lift them up with Christ's own good news?\n(900.94, 907.5)  Or do we sometimes, as I would have to admit I do, maybe just bring a flat message or maybe\n(907.5, 912.22)  even a negative message or an unhelpful message?\n(912.22, 918.58)  Can we as much as possible always move toward the light which enlightened Mary Magdalene\n(918.58, 926.08)  and which told her Christ is risen, our whole vision of life is different because Christ\n(926.08, 939.44)  has made all things new and nothing, demons, sins, troubles, worries, people, our own shortcomings\n(939.44, 943.84)  can overshadow the good news of the resurrection of Christ.\n(943.84, 945.0)  There is hope.\n(945.0, 946.46)  There is life.\n(946.46, 949.1)  There is lots to be thankful for.\n(949.1, 953.1)  And there is the prospect of regeneration\n(953.1, 957.6)  where it seemed as if maybe things were just going downward.\n(957.6, 961.38)  So let's be apostolic in the way of Mary Magdalene.\n(961.38, 965.58)  Let's be apostles to the apostles of Jesus.\n(969.44, 993.04)  Let us pray.\n(993.04, 1001.08)  Let us pray.\n(1001.08, 1006.96)  For church leaders and missionaries, may God make them fearless witnesses in proclaiming\n(1006.96, 1011.48)  Jesus' resurrection from the dead, we pray to the Lord.\n(1011.48, 1012.96)  Lord hear our prayer.\n(1012.96, 1020.36)  For all nations, may God inspire those in power to govern justly, we pray to the Lord.\n(1020.36, 1021.72)  Lord hear our prayer.\n(1021.72, 1028.14)  For all whose lives are threatened or disrupted by war or other forms of violence, may the\n(1028.14, 1032.7)  Lord help them find safety and peace, we pray to the Lord.\n(1032.7, 1034.42)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1034.42, 1042.14)  For all in this faith community, may God sanctify us in our witness to Him, we pray to the Lord.\n(1042.14, 1043.94)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(1043.94, 1051.12)  For our beloved dead, especially Janelle Paterna, for whom this Mass is offered, may they who\n(1051.12, 1057.68)  lived in Christ in this life soon see the resurrected Jesus face to face we\n(1057.68, 1065.92)  pray to the Lord Lord hear our prayer Lord God as you selected Mary Magdalene\n(1065.92, 1072.0)  to take on the special work of proclaiming the resurrection so you have\n(1072.0, 1078.18)  selected us to be hearers of that good news and to be people who take it to\n(1078.18, 1085.7)  higher and let it color every value every word every deed that is ours may\n(1085.7, 1092.38)  we live differently because the message of your son Jesus resurrected and the\n(1092.38, 1098.66)  message of Mary Magdalene has reached us and taken deep root we ask this through\n(1098.66, 1102.02)  Christ our Lord\n(1168.18, 1188.98)  Pray, my brothers and sisters, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God, the almighty\n(1188.98, 1202.12)  Father. Accept, O Lord, the offerings presented in the commemoration of St.\n(1202.12, 1207.58)  Mary Magdalene, whose homage of charity was graciously accepted by your only\n(1207.58, 1214.02)  begotten Son, who lives and reigns forever and ever. The Lord be with you.\n(1214.02, 1222.78)  Lift up your hearts. Let us give thanks to the Lord our God. It is truly right and\n(1222.78, 1228.42)  just our duty and our salvation always and everywhere to give you thanks Lord\n(1228.42, 1233.74)  Holy Father almighty and eternal God through Christ our Lord for in the\n(1233.74, 1238.9)  marvelous confession of your saints you make your church fruitful with strength\n(1238.9, 1245.38)  ever knew and you offer us sure signs of your love and that your saving\n(1245.38, 1251.26)  mysteries may be fulfilled their great example lends us courage their fervent\n(1251.26, 1258.18)  prayers sustain us in all we do and so Lord with all the angels and Saints we\n(1258.18, 1266.38)  too give you thanks and in exultation we acclaim holy holy holy Lord God of\n(1266.38, 1273.5)  Heaven and earth are full of your glory, Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he who\n(1273.5, 1278.86)  comes in the name of the Lord, Hosanna in the highest.\n(1282.7, 1288.62)  You are indeed holy, O Lord, the fount of all holiness. Make holy therefore these\n(1288.62, 1294.02)  gifts, we pray, by sending down your spirit upon them like the dewfall, so\n(1294.02, 1299.7)  that they may become for us the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ at the\n(1299.7, 1305.06)  time he was betrayed and entered willingly into his passion Jesus took\n(1305.06, 1311.38)  bread giving you thanks father he broke it and gave it to his disciples saying\n(1311.38, 1317.78)  take this all of you and eat of it for this is my body which will be given up\n(1317.78, 1336.62)  in a similar way when supper was ended Jesus took the chalice once more giving\n(1336.62, 1342.9)  thanks he gave it to his disciples saying take this all of you and root\n(1342.9, 1347.54)  from it but this is the chalice of my blood the blood of the new and he\n(1347.54, 1353.3)  eternal covenant which will be poured out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins.\n(1353.86, 1356.7)  Do this in memory of me.\n(1370.2, 1372.2)  The mystery of faith.\n(1372.82, 1372.2) \n(1380.2, 1384.2)  We proclaim your death, O Lord, and profess your resurrection until you come again. Therefore, as we celebrate the memorial of His death and resurrection,\n(1384.2, 1389.2)  we offer you, Lord, the bread of life and the chalice of salvation,\n(1389.2, 1394.2)  giving thanks that you have held us worthy to be in your presence and minister to you.\n(1394.2, 1398.2)  Humbly, we pray, that partaking of the body and blood of Christ,\n(1398.2, 1402.34)  we may be gathered into one by the Holy Spirit.\n(1402.34, 1405.72)  Remember, Lord, your church spread throughout the world\n(1405.72, 1408.56)  and bring her to the fullness of charity.\n(1408.56, 1411.92)  Together with Leo, our pope, Richard, our bishop,\n(1411.92, 1415.1)  and all the clergy, religious, and all your people.\n(1416.06, 1419.0)  Remember our brothers and sisters who have fallen asleep\n(1419.0, 1421.06)  in the hope of the resurrection\n(1421.06, 1423.04)  and all who have died in your mercy.\n(1425.08, 1423.04) \n(1432.04, 1440.04)  Remember your servant, Janelle, whom you have called from this world to yourself. Grant that she who was united with your son in death may be united with him in resurrection.\n(1440.04, 1448.04)  Have mercy on us all, we pray, that with the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God and Gate of Heaven,\n(1448.04, 1455.04)  with the Blessed Apostles, Saint Mary Magdalene and all the Saints whom you have pleased throughout the ages.\n(1455.04, 1464.04)  We may merit to be co-heirs to eternal life and may praise and glorify you through your Son, Jesus Christ.\n(1466.04, 1472.04)  Through him and with him and in him, O God Almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\n(1472.04, 1477.04)  all glory and honor is yours forever and ever.\n(1478.04, 1501.36)  With Jesus, we confidently pray, Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.\n(1501.36, 1506.76)  Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.\n(1506.76, 1513.06)  Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who\n(1513.06, 1522.02)  trespass against us, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.\n(1522.02, 1527.58)  Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil, graciously grant peace in our days, that by\n(1527.58, 1535.14)  the help of your mercy we may be always free from sin, and safe from all distress, as we\n(1535.14, 1544.5)  we await the blessed hope and the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ.\n(1544.5, 1549.66)  Lord Jesus Christ, you said to your apostles, peace I leave you, my peace I give you.\n(1549.66, 1555.06)  Look not on our sins, but on the faith of your church, and graciously grant her peace\n(1555.06, 1561.56)  and unity in accordance with your will, who live and reign forever and ever.\n(1561.56, 1565.48)  The peace of the Lord be with you always.\n(1565.48, 1576.32)  Let us offer each other a sign of peace.\n(1576.32, 1581.84)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1581.84, 1587.36)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1587.36, 1592.36)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world. Grant us peace.\n(1598.36, 1603.36)  Behold, the Lamb of God, behold him who takes away the sins of the world.\n(1603.36, 1607.36)  Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb.\n(1607.36, 1610.36)  Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof,\n(1610.36, 1614.36)  but only say the word and my soul shall be healed.\n(1617.36, 1624.36)  All right, everybody, we're going to take a short break, and we're going to take a short\n(1624.36, 1625.36)  break.\n(1625.36, 1632.36)  We're going to take a short break, and we're going to take a short break, and we're going\n(1632.36, 1639.36)  to take a short break, and we're going to take a short break, and we're going to take\n(1639.36, 1646.36)  a short break, and we're going to take a short break, and we're going to take a short break,\n(1646.36, 1673.8)  The body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body\n(1673.8, 1680.8)  The body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ.\n(1763.8, 1781.8)  Let us pray.\n(1781.8, 1788.28)  May the holy reception of your mysteries, Lord, instill in us that persevering love\n(1788.28, 1795.28)  with which St. Mary Magdalene clung resolutely to Christ, her master, who lives and reigns\n(1796.24, 1803.24)  forever. Great to be with you today. I was telling Kevin that my only other time presiding\n(1804.44, 1809.92)  in this church was back in the early 80s. The pastor, Father Donovan, had died and was\n(1809.92, 1816.04)  being waked in the church, and Father Toomey, who had been my classmate, called me and asked\n(1816.04, 1821.68)  me if I was available. I was studying in Washington at the time and I came that weekend and celebrated\n(1821.68, 1828.0)  here in the upper church and hopefully it was helpful then and hopefully helpful today.\n(1828.0, 1833.6)  Have a wonderful feast of Mary Magdalene. The Lord be with you. May almighty God bless\n(1833.6, 1834.28)  you.\n",

Amen. Let us pray.\n(413.84, 420.72)  O God, who in the abasement of your Son Jesus have raised up a fallen world, fill\n(420.72, 426.96)  your faithful with holy joy, for on those you have rescued from slavery to sin you\n(426.96, 432.32)  bestow eternal gladness through our Lord Jesus Christ your son who lives and\n(432.32, 443.88)  reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit God forever and ever a reading\n(443.88, 451.2)  from the book of the Prophet Isaiah thus says the Lord rejoice with Jerusalem and\n(451.2, 455.52)  and be glad because of her, all you who love her.\n(455.52, 460.52)  Exult, exult with her, all you who are mourning over her.\n(462.28, 466.68)  Oh, that you may suck fully of the milk of her comfort,\n(466.68, 470.76)  that you may nurse with delight at her abundant breaths.\n(470.76, 473.22)  For thus says the Lord,\n(473.22, 478.22)  lo, I will spread prosperity over Jerusalem like a river,\n(479.36, 478.22) \n(483.98, 490.62)  river, and the wealth of the nations like an overflowing torrent. As nurselings, you shall be carried in her arms and fondled in her lap.\n(490.62, 496.3)  As a mother comforts her child, so will I comfort you.\n(496.3, 501.14)  In Jerusalem, you shall find your comfort.\n(501.14, 509.02)  When you see this, your heart shall rejoice and your bodies flourish like the grass.\n(509.02, 513.24)  The Lord's power shall be known to his servants.\n(513.24, 517.04)  The word of the Lord.\n(517.04, 524.96)  Let all the earth cry out to God with joy.\n(524.96, 532.32)  joyfully to God, all the earth. Sing praise to the glory of his name. Proclaim\n(532.32, 544.0)  his glorious praise. Say to God, how tremendous are your deeds. Let all on\n(544.0, 550.58)  earth worship and sing praise to you. Sing praise to your name. Come and see\n(550.58, 561.62)  works of God, his tremendous deeds, among\n(574.04, 561.62) \n(568.4, 584.92)  the sea into dry land through the river\n(589.42, 591.62)  Blessed be God, who refused me not my prayer or his kindness.\n(603.18, 609.26)  A reading from the letter of Saint Paul to the Galatians. Brothers and sisters, may I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the\n(609.26, 616.3)  world has been crucified to me and I to the world. For neither does circumcision\n(616.3, 625.54)  mean anything, nor does uncircumcision, but only a new creation. Peace and mercy\n(625.54, 634.38)  be to all who follow this rule and to the Israel of God. From now on, let no one\n(634.38, 642.66)  make troubles for me, for I bear the marks of Jesus on my body. The grace of\n(642.66, 646.88)  of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit,\n(646.88, 649.86)  brothers and sisters, amen.\n(649.86, 651.52)  The word of the Lord.\n(672.66, 686.14)  the Lord be with you a reading from the Holy Gospel according to Luke at that\n(686.14, 692.46)  time the Lord appointed 72 others whom he sent ahead of him in pairs to every\n(692.46, 699.18)  town and place he intended to visit he said to them the harvest is abundant but\n(699.18, 706.46)  the labourers are few. So ask the master of the harvest to send out labourers for his harvest.\n(707.58, 715.34)  Go on your way, behold I am sending you like lambs among wolves. Carry no money bag, no sack,\n(715.34, 721.74)  no sandals, and greet no one along the way. Into whatever house you enter first say peace\n(721.74, 727.5)  to this household, and if a peaceful person lives there your peace will rest on him,\n(728.14, 727.5) \n(734.22, 739.32)  but if not it will return to you. Stay in the same house and need and drink what is offered to you for the laborer deserves his payment. Do not move about\n(739.32, 744.54)  from one house to another whatever town you enter and they welcome you eat what\n(744.54, 750.18)  is set before you cure the sick in it and say to them the kingdom of God is at\n(750.18, 755.9)  hand for you. The Gospel of the Lord.\n(757.5, 767.86)  Today's scriptures are about announcing the good news and they remind us that announcing\n(767.86, 775.94)  the good news of the kingdom by words or deeds or even our life is not the task of only a\n(775.94, 782.98)  few as Jesus says in today's gospel, rather it's the task for all baptized Christians,\n(782.98, 784.42)  all of us.\n(784.42, 788.98)  In today's Gospel, we are given a powerful image of mission.\n(788.98, 797.78)  Jesus appoints 72 others, the Gospel says, and sends them out two by two ahead of him\n(797.78, 801.9)  into every town and place he himself intended to go.\n(801.9, 804.74)  Now these were not the twelve apostles.\n(804.74, 809.18)  These were ordinary disciples, followers of Christ at that time.\n(809.18, 816.06)  They were unnamed, perhaps even unremarkable in the eyes of the world, but they were chosen\n(816.06, 817.94)  nonetheless.\n(817.94, 821.26)  And that is precisely where the power of this Gospel lies.\n(821.26, 825.18)  This Gospel teaches us a crucial truth.\n(825.18, 834.06)  The task of proclaiming the good news of Jesus is not reserved for a few, but it's entrusted\n(834.06, 836.18)  to all.\n(836.18, 840.0)  Every baptized Christian is sent.\n(840.0, 843.84)  Every believer has a role in the mission.\n(843.84, 850.24)  In the eyes of Christ, you are one of the 72.\n(850.24, 856.84)  Jesus says, the harvest is abundant and the laborers are few.\n(856.84, 863.42)  So ask the master of the harvest to send out laborers for his harvest.\n(863.42, 869.12)  we hear this and think immediately of priests and religious sisters or\n(869.12, 875.68)  missionaries, and yes we do need to pray for vocations, but let us not forget that\n(875.68, 880.16)  Jesus was speaking to all of his followers when he said that, not only\n(880.16, 889.32)  those in clerical or religious life. The laborers he desires are you and me. We\n(889.32, 896.16)  We live in a world that is hungry, hungry for truth and for love and for peace and for\n(896.16, 899.0)  meaning in one's life.\n(899.0, 906.14)  The world needs witnesses of the Lord and that's what Jesus sends out all of us to be,\n(906.14, 910.8)  people who embody the good news of Jesus Christ.\n(910.8, 916.52)  You notice that he sends them two by two to towns and villages.\n(916.52, 921.84)  The mission is not solitary, we're all part of the church, the body of Christ, and our\n(921.84, 926.76)  strength is found in our communion, in our community.\n(926.76, 934.44)  The question of the Lord that asks of us today is, where is your mission field?\n(934.44, 940.2)  Where is your town or village that you need to bring the presence of God?\n(940.2, 948.04)  Perhaps your mission field is your family or your workplace or your neighborhood.\n(948.04, 954.74)  You may be the only Christian someone meets who lives the Gospel with integrity.\n(954.74, 964.16)  They may be your town or your village to which Christ intends to visit after your witness.\n(964.16, 973.16)  And Christ reminds the 72 that their mission is one of humility, of love, and of servant-hearted\n(973.16, 975.2)  witness.\n(975.2, 982.68)  We are not sent to condemn the world, to point the finger at those who do not know Christ\n(982.68, 986.32)  or are not living good Christian lives.\n(986.32, 992.48)  We are called to help heal the world, to invite people to understand what the good news can\n(992.48, 997.88)  be for them and to bring the nearness of God to every heart.\n(997.88, 1001.44)  So how do we do that in our own little worlds?\n(1001.44, 1006.36)  We go out every day into a world that still longs for Christ.\n(1006.36, 1012.08)  We go out through our conversations with one another, our choices that we make that show\n(1012.08, 1014.26)  others our goodness.\n(1014.26, 1019.6)  We show others our care for the poor or how we forgive others.\n(1019.6, 1024.8)  We go out by being people of integrity and mercy in a world that sometimes doesn't show\n(1024.8, 1027.0)  mercy.\n(1027.0, 1034.08)  We carry Christ's message of love when we comfort the suffering, seek justice and fairness,\n(1034.08, 1036.48)  and speak with love.\n(1036.48, 1044.08)  So today Jesus sends you, not because you are perfect, but because the harvest is abundant\n(1044.08, 1047.0)  and the laborers are few.\n(1047.0, 1054.08)  We cannot say I'm not ready, we cannot say let someone else go.\n(1054.08, 1062.68)  The Lord has called us by name, he has anointed us in baptism and we are his witnesses.\n(1062.68, 1070.88)  We're living in a world that desperately needs the voice of Christ, spoken through our lives.\n(1070.88, 1077.26)  Our witness as followers of Christ with all of our limitations and faults is so needed\n(1077.26, 1082.58)  today in our neighborhood, in our families, and in our workplace.\n(1082.58, 1089.54)  As Christ reminds us, the mission belongs to all the faithful, not just a few.\n(1089.54, 1098.16)  The world needs saints of the ordinary, holy mothers and fathers, courageous teenagers,\n(1098.16, 1101.5)  faithful young adults, and joyful Christians.\n(1101.5, 1106.04)  So let's go forth as the 72 ordinary, yes,\n(1106.04, 1111.04)  but chosen by God, sent by God to spread peace,\n(1111.44, 1113.88)  joy, and love in this world.\n(1128.16, 1144.56)  We now profess our faith in God.\n(1144.56, 1151.64)  I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all things visible\n(1151.64, 1153.44)  and invisible.\n(1153.44, 1160.2)  I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, born of the Father before\n(1160.2, 1167.64)  all ages, God from God, light from light, true God from true God, begotten, not made,\n(1167.64, 1170.0)  consubstantial with the Father.\n(1170.0, 1172.28)  Through him all things were made.\n(1172.28, 1178.48)  For us men and for our salvation he came down from heaven, and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate\n(1178.48, 1181.72)  of the Virgin Mary and became man.\n(1181.72, 1187.56)  For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate, he suffered death and was buried,\n(1187.56, 1191.72)  and rose again on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures.\n(1191.72, 1196.08)  He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father.\n(1196.08, 1201.48)  He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead, and his kingdom will have no\n(1201.48, 1202.48)  end.\n(1202.48, 1207.92)  I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father\n(1207.92, 1213.04)  and the Son, who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified, who has\n(1213.04, 1218.84)  spoken through the prophets. I believe in one holy catholic and apostolic church, I\n(1218.84, 1224.36)  confess one baptism for the forgiveness of sins, and I look forward to the\n(1224.36, 1229.58)  resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come. Amen. As we\n(1229.58, 1234.84)  acknowledge the great things God has done for us, we turn to him who never\n(1234.84, 1241.92)  rejects our prayers, nor withholds his love for us. We pray that God may grant\n(1241.92, 1247.68)  his love and wisdom to our Holy Father, Pope Leo, that he may be conscious that\n(1247.68, 1253.14)  he is an instrument of the Lord as he seeks to serve and lead the church. We\n(1253.14, 1259.24)  pray to the Lord. Lord hear our prayer. We pray that world leaders may be blessed\n(1259.24, 1265.32)  with the compassion of Christ in serving their people we pray to the Lord Lord\n(1265.32, 1272.1)  hear our prayer we pray for those who are traveling on vacation that like the\n(1272.1, 1278.16)  disciples they may travel light and bring peace with them and not forget the\n(1278.16, 1286.04)  God who accompanies them we pray to the Lord Lord hear our prayer for all those\n(1286.04, 1291.42)  affected by the Texas floods on Friday, we pray especially for the families who\n(1291.42, 1298.46)  have lost children and loved ones. We pray to the Lord. Lord hear our prayer. We\n(1298.46, 1305.06)  pray for all who seek healing. May Jesus, the divine physician, bring them health\n(1305.06, 1311.38)  and peace. We pray to the Lord. Lord hear our prayer. We pray for our dead,\n(1311.38, 1317.58)  especially our parishioners, for whom this Mass is offered. For Dennis Mesette,\n(1317.58, 1325.62)  Camilla Schori, Ernest Sodilo, and for all our deceased relatives, friends, and\n(1325.62, 1330.86)  parishioners, that they may find a place of rest and a haven of peace with the\n(1330.86, 1335.38)  Lord. We pray to the Lord.\n(1335.38, 1338.12)  May the silent prayers in our hearts be\n(1338.12, 1350.04)  lifted up to God, who knows our needs even before we ask. We pray to the Lord.\n(1350.04, 1356.44)  Lord, hear our prayer. Merciful Father, you have chosen us to share in your son's\n(1356.44, 1361.36)  mission. Hear and answer our prayers today that we ask through Christ our\n(1361.36, 1363.96)  Lord.\n(1398.12, 1414.2)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through your goodness we have received\n(1414.2, 1419.32)  the bread we offer you, fruit of the earth and work of human hands, it will become for\n(1419.32, 1423.12)  us the bread of life.\n(1423.12, 1427.56)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through your goodness we have received\n(1427.56, 1433.3)  wine we offer you, fruit of the vine and work of human hands, it will become our spiritual\n(1433.3, 1448.9)  drink.\n(1448.9, 1454.28)  Pray brothers and sisters that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God the almighty\n(1454.28, 1469.34)  Father may this oblation dedicated to your name purify us o Lord and day by\n(1469.34, 1476.12)  day bring our conduct closer to the life of heaven through Christ our Lord the\n(1476.12, 1484.0)  Lord be with you lift up your hearts let us give thanks to the Lord our God\n(1484.0, 1490.52)  It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, always and everywhere, to\n(1490.52, 1496.52)  give you thanks, Lord, Holy Father, Almighty and Eternal God. For we know it\n(1496.52, 1501.56)  belongs to your boundless glory that you came to the aid of mortal beings with\n(1501.56, 1508.6)  your divinity, and even fashioned for us a remedy out of mortality itself. Through\n(1508.6, 1513.36)  him the hosts of angels adores your majesty and rejoices in your presence\n(1513.36, 1519.0)  forever. May our voices, we pray, join with theirs in one chorus of exultant\n(1519.0, 1527.36)  praise. Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts, heaven and earth are full of your glory,\n(1527.36, 1533.04)  Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord,\n(1533.04, 1540.76)  Hosanna in the highest. You are indeed holy, O Lord, the fount of all holiness.\n(1540.76, 1546.52)  make holy therefore these gifts we pray by sending down your spirit upon them\n(1546.52, 1551.86)  like the dewfall so that they may become for us the body and blood of our Lord\n(1551.86, 1558.12)  Jesus Christ at the time he was betrayed and entered willingly into his passion\n(1558.12, 1564.2)  he took bread and giving thanks broke it and gave it to his disciples saying take\n(1564.2, 1570.16)  this all of you and eat of it for this is my body which will be given up for\n(1570.16, 1582.92)  you. In a similar way when supper was ended he took the chalice and once more\n(1582.92, 1587.84)  giving thanks he gave it to his disciples saying take this all of you and\n(1587.84, 1592.36)  drink from it for this is the chalice of my blood the blood of the new and\n(1592.36, 1596.4)  eternal covenant which will be poured out for you and for many for the\n(1596.4, 1602.4)  forgiveness of sins. Do this in memory of me.\n(1609.48, 1616.28)  The mystery of faith. When we eat this bread and drink this cup, we proclaim\n(1616.28, 1622.6)  your death, O Lord, until you come again. Therefore, as we celebrate the memorial\n(1622.6, 1626.52)  of his death and resurrection we offer you Lord the bread of life and the\n(1626.52, 1631.68)  chalice of salvation giving thanks that you have held us worthy to be in your\n(1631.68, 1637.4)  presence and minister to you humbly we pray that partaking of the body and\n(1637.4, 1643.12)  blood of Christ we may be gathered into one by the Holy Spirit remember Lord\n(1643.12, 1647.56)  your church spread throughout the world and bring her to the fullness of charity\n(1647.56, 1654.32)  together with Leo our Pope and Richard our Bishop and all the clergy.

Paul to the Galatians brothers and sisters may I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ through which the\n(781.16, 786.82)  world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.\n(786.82, 795.92)  For neither does circumcision mean anything, nor does uncircumcision, but only a new creation.\n(795.92, 803.56)  Peace and mercy be to all who follow this rule, and to the Israel of God.\n(803.56, 812.0)  From now on, let no one make troubles for me, for I bear the marks of Jesus on my body.\n(812.0, 820.2)  The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers and sisters, amen.\n(820.2, 821.2)  The word of the Lord.\n(821.2, 822.2)  Hallelujah.\n(822.2, 823.2)  Hallelujah.\n(823.2, 824.2)  Hallelujah.\n(824.2, 825.2)  Hallelujah.\n(825.2, 826.2)  Hallelujah.\n(826.2, 827.2)  Hallelujah.\n(827.2, 828.2)  Hallelujah.\n(828.2, 829.2)  Hallelujah.\n(829.2, 830.2)  Hallelujah.\n(830.2, 831.2)  Hallelujah.\n(831.2, 832.2)  Hallelujah.\n(832.2, 833.2)  Hallelujah.\n(833.2, 834.2)  Hallelujah.\n(834.2, 835.2)  Hallelujah.\n(835.2, 836.2)  Hallelujah.\n(836.2, 837.2)  Hallelujah.\n(837.2, 838.2)  Hallelujah.\n(838.2, 839.2)  Hallelujah.\n(839.2, 840.2)  Hallelujah.\n(840.2, 841.2)  Hallelujah.\n(841.2, 842.2)  Hallelujah.\n(842.2, 843.2)  Hallelujah.\n(843.2, 844.2)  Hallelujah.\n(844.2, 845.2)  Hallelujah.\n(845.2, 846.2)  Hallelujah.\n(846.2, 847.2)  Hallelujah.\n(847.2, 848.2)  Hallelujah.\n(848.2, 849.2)  Hallelujah.\n(849.2, 850.2)  Hallelujah.\n(850.2, 856.2)  Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah.\n(856.2, 862.2)  Let the peace of Christ control your hearts.\n(862.2, 869.2)  Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly.\n(869.2, 874.2)  Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah.\n(874.2, 875.2)  Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah.\n(875.2, 876.2)  Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah.\n(876.2, 877.2)  Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah.\n(877.2, 878.2)  Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah.\n(878.2, 879.2)  Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah.\n(879.2, 890.56)  the Lord be with you a reading from the holy gospel according to Luke at that\n(890.56, 898.16)  time the Lord appointed 72 others whom he sent ahead of him in pairs to every\n(898.16, 904.88)  town and place he intended to visit he said to them the harvest is abundant but\n(904.88, 912.24)  the labourers are few. So ask the master of the harvest to send out labourers for his harvest.\n(913.52, 920.32)  Go on your way, behold I am sending you like lambs among wolves. Carry no money bag,\n(920.32, 927.28)  no sack, no sandals, and greet no one along the way. Into whatever house you enter first say,\n(927.84, 934.08)  peace to this household. If a peaceful person lives there, your peace will rest on him.\n(934.8, 934.08) \n(940.62, 946.9)  but if not it will return to you. Stay in the same house and eat and drink what is offered to you, for the laborer deserves his payment. Do not move about from one\n(946.9, 952.58)  house to another. Whatever town you enter and they welcome you, eat what is set\n(952.58, 958.62)  before you, cure the sick in it, and say to them the Kingdom of God is at hand\n(958.62, 964.3)  for you. The Gospel of the Lord.\n(969.3, 975.38)  Today's scriptures are about announcing the good news. They remind us that\n(975.38, 981.34)  announcing the good news of the kingdom by our words or deeds and life is not\n(981.34, 987.22)  just the task of a few, rather it's the task for all baptized Christians. In\n(987.22, 993.26)  In today's Gospel from Luke, we're given this powerful image of mission.\n(993.26, 1002.18)  Jesus appoints 72 others, he says, and sends them out two by two, ahead of him, into every\n(1002.18, 1006.16)  town and place that he himself intended to go.\n(1006.16, 1012.7)  Now these were not the twelve apostles, these were ordinary disciples, unnamed, perhaps\n(1012.7, 1019.82)  even unremarkable in the eyes of the world, but they were chosen by Christ nonetheless.\n(1019.82, 1023.14)  And that is precisely where the power of this Gospel lies.\n(1023.14, 1026.54)  The Gospel teaches us a crucial truth.\n(1026.54, 1034.62)  The task of proclaiming the good news is not reserved for the few, but it is entrusted\n(1034.62, 1037.98)  to all, to all of us.\n(1037.98, 1041.82)  Every baptized Christian is sent.\n(1041.82, 1046.62)  Every believer has a role in the mission of Christ.\n(1046.62, 1053.14)  In the eyes of Christ, you are one of the 72.\n(1053.14, 1058.22)  Jesus says the harvest is abundant, but the laborers are few.\n(1058.22, 1064.66)  So ask the master of the harvest to send out laborers for his harvest.\n(1064.66, 1072.46)  When we hear that verse, we often think immediately of vocations to the priesthood or religious\n(1072.46, 1081.38)  sisters or missionaries, and yes, we do need to pray for vocations, but we not forget hopefully\n(1081.38, 1088.38)  that Jesus was speaking to all his followers, not only to those in clerical or religious\n(1088.38, 1096.7)  life. The laborers he desires are you and me. We live in a world that is hungry,\n(1096.7, 1103.82)  hungry for truth and for love, for peace, for meaning in one's life. The world\n(1103.82, 1112.22)  needs witnesses of the Lord and that's what Jesus sends us out to be, people who\n(1112.22, 1120.58)  embody the good news of Jesus Christ. Jesus sends them two by two to towns and\n(1120.58, 1126.86)  villages and the mission is not solitary. We're all part of the church, the body of\n(1126.86, 1133.82)  Christ, and our strength is found in communion, in community. The question the\n(1133.82, 1139.58)  Lord asked us today is where is your mission field, if you will? Where is your\n(1139.58, 1145.46)  mission field. Where is your town or village that you need to bring the\n(1145.46, 1152.98)  presence of God to? Perhaps your mission field is your family or your workplace\n(1152.98, 1160.96)  or your neighborhood. You may be the only Christian someone meets who lives the\n(1160.96, 1167.3)  gospel with integrity. That may be your town or your village to which Christ\n(1167.3, 1175.98)  intends to visit after your witness. And Christ reminds us, the 72, that the\n(1175.98, 1182.58)  mission is a mission of humility, of love, of servant-hearted witness. We're not\n(1182.58, 1187.86)  sent out to condemn the world, to point the finger at those who do not know\n(1187.86, 1196.58)  Christ or are not living good lives as Christians. We're called to, and mission\n(1196.58, 1202.26)  to help heal the world, to invite people to understand what the good news can be\n(1202.26, 1209.02)  for them, and to bring the nearness of God to everyone we meet. How do we do\n(1209.02, 1214.46)  that in our own little worlds? We go out every day into a world that still longs\n(1214.46, 1221.34)  for Christ. We go out through our conversations with one another. The\n(1221.34, 1228.58)  choices that we make that shows others our goodness. We show others care for the\n(1228.58, 1235.62)  poor, how we forgive each other. We go out by being people of integrity and mercy\n(1235.62, 1242.42)  in a world that sometimes doesn't show that. We're carrying Christ's message of\n(1242.42, 1248.22)  love when we comfort the suffering or seek justice and fairness and speak with\n(1248.22, 1256.86)  love. Today Jesus sends us not because we are perfect but because the harvest is\n(1256.86, 1264.32)  abundant and the laborers are few and we cannot say I'm not ready, we cannot say\n(1264.32, 1271.2)  let someone else go. The Lord has called us by name, he has anointed us in\n(1271.2, 1279.38)  baptism and we are his witnesses. We are living in a time that desperately needs\n(1279.38, 1287.82)  the voice of Christ, spoken through our lives. Our witnesses as follows of Christ\n(1287.82, 1292.86)  with all our limitations and faults is so needed today in our neighborhood, in\n(1292.86, 1301.74)  our families, in our workplace. As Christ reminds us, the mission belongs to all\n(1301.74, 1309.26)  the faithful, not just a few. The world needs saints of the ordinary, holy\n(1309.26, 1316.2)  mothers and fathers, courageous teenagers, faithful young adults, and joyful\n(1316.2, 1325.8)  Christians. So let's go forth as the 72 very ordinary people did, ordinary but\n(1325.8, 1334.8)  yes chosen by Christ, sent by God to spread peace joy and love in our little\n(1334.8, 1337.32)  worlds.\n(1346.2, 1370.96)  We now profess our faith in God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\n(1370.96, 1377.92)  I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all things visible\n(1377.92, 1379.6)  and invisible.\n(1379.6, 1386.26)  I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, born of the Father before\n(1386.26, 1388.0)  all ages.\n(1388.0, 1394.52)  God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, consubstantial\n(1394.52, 1396.08)  with the Father.\n(1396.08, 1398.4)  Through him all things were made.\n(1398.4, 1404.72)  For us men and for our salvation he came down from heaven and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate\n(1404.72, 1408.1)  of the Virgin Mary and became man.\n(1408.1, 1413.84)  For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate, he suffered death and was buried,\n(1413.84, 1417.98)  and rose again on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures.\n(1417.98, 1422.68)  He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father.\n(1422.68, 1427.56)  He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead, and his kingdom will have no\n(1427.56, 1434.16)  end. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father\n(1434.16, 1439.88)  and the Son, who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified, who has spoken through\n(1439.88, 1446.92)  the prophets. I believe in one holy catholic and apostolic church. I confess one baptism\n(1446.92, 1452.6)  for the forgiveness of sins, and I look forward to the resurrection of the dead and the life\n(1452.6, 1458.54)  for the world to come. Amen. As we acknowledge all the great things God has\n(1458.54, 1463.62)  done for us we turn to him who never rejects our prayer nor withholds his\n(1463.62, 1470.54)  love for us. We pray that God may grant his love and wisdom to our Holy Father\n(1470.54, 1476.5)  Pope Leo that he may be conscious that he is an instrument of the Lord as he\n(1476.5, 1483.28)  seeks to serve and lead the church we pray to the Lord Lord hear our prayer we\n(1483.28, 1488.28)  pray that world leaders may be blessed with the compassion of Christ in serving\n(1488.28, 1494.74)  their people we pray to the Lord Lord hear our prayer we pray for those who\n(1494.74, 1499.72)  are traveling on vacation that like the disciples they may travel light and\n(1499.72, 1505.78)  bring peace with them and not forget the God who accompanies them we pray to the\n(1505.78, 1511.78)  Lord, hear our prayer. For all those affected by the Texas floods on Friday,\n(1511.78, 1518.84)  we pray especially for the families who have lost children and loved ones. We\n(1518.84, 1525.62)  pray to the Lord. Lord, hear our prayer. We pray for all who seek healing. May\n(1525.62, 1531.98)  Jesus, the Divine Physician, bring them health and peace. We pray to the Lord.\n(1531.98, 1539.84)  Lord, hear our prayer. We pray for our dead, especially John Hayes Jr. for whom\n(1539.84, 1547.04)  this Mass is offered, for Dennis Missett, Camilla Shorey, Ernest Sordillo, and for\n(1547.04, 1552.28)  all of our deceased relatives, friends, and parishioners, that they may find a\n(1552.28, 1558.6)  place of rest and a haven of peace with the Lord. We pray to the Lord. Lord, hear\n(1558.6, 1565.04)  our prayer. May the silent prayers in our hearts be lifted up to God who knows our\n(1565.04, 1574.16)  needs even before we ask. We pray to the Lord. Lord hear our prayer. Merciful\n(1574.16, 1579.16)  Father you have chosen us to share in your son's mission here in answer our\n(1579.16, 1583.96)  prayers that we ask through Christ our Lord.\n(1586.2, 1583.96) \n(1592.96, 1613.96)  Please join in singing No. 574, Seek Ye First, No. 574.\n(1623.0, 1629.96)  of God, and his righteousness. And all these things shall be added unto you.\n(1629.96, 1638.42)  Allelu, alleluia.\n(1638.42, 1652.9)  Ask and it shall be given unto you, seek and ye shall find.\n(1652.9, 1660.88)  Knock and it shall be opened unto you.\n(1660.88, 1670.88)  Hallelujah, Hallelujah.\n(1670.88, 1674.32)  Pray, brothers and sisters, that my sacrifice and yours\n(1674.32, 1677.88)  may be acceptable to God, the almighty Father.\n(1677.88, 1680.88)  May the Lord accept the sacrifice at your hands,\n(1680.88, 1682.88)  for the praise and glory of his name,\n(1682.88, 1685.88)  for all the good and the good of all his holy Church.\n(1685.88, 1688.44)  May this oblation dedicated to your name\n(1688.44, 1694.32)  purify us, O Lord, and day by day bring our conduct closer to the life of heaven,\n(1694.32, 1702.88)  through Christ our Lord. The Lord be with you. Lift up your hearts. Let us give\n(1702.88, 1708.88)  thanks to the Lord our God. It is truly right and just, our duty and our\n(1708.88, 1714.68)  salvation, always and everywhere to give you thanks, Lord Holy Father, Almighty and\n(1714.68, 1720.2)  eternal God through Christ our Lord. For out of compassion for the way witness\n(1720.2, 1726.02)  that is ours he humbled himself and was born of the Virgin. By the passion of the\n(1726.02, 1731.0)  cross he freed us from unending death and by rising from the dead he gave us\n(1731.0, 1735.96)  life eternal. And so with angels and archangels we now sing the hymn of your\n(1735.96, 1740.76)  glory as without end we acclaim.\n(1744.68, 1754.68)  Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts,\n(1754.68, 1764.18)  heaven and earth are full of your glory.\n(1764.18, 1769.68)  Hosanna in the highest,\n(1769.68, 1784.68)  Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.\n(1784.68, 1797.68)  Hosanna in the highest. Hosanna in the highest.\n(1799.68, 1807.12)  You are indeed holy, O Lord, the fount of all holiness. Make holy, therefore, these\n(1807.12, 1812.62)  gifts, we pray, by sending down your spirit upon them like the dewfall, so\n(1812.62, 1818.38)  that they may become for us the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ. At the\n(1818.38, 1823.42)  time he was betrayed and entered willingly into his passion, he took bread\n(1823.42, 1829.38)  and, giving thanks, broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying, Take this, all of\n(1829.38, 1836.3)  you, and eat of it. For this is my body which will be given up for you.\"\n(1843.02, 1848.34)  In a similar way when supper was ended he took the chalice and once more giving\n(1848.34, 1853.14)  thanks he gave it to his disciples saying, take this all of you and drink\n(1853.14, 1857.54)  from it. For this is the chalice of my blood, the blood of the new and eternal\n(1857.54, 1861.34)  eternal covenant, which will be poured out for you and for many for the\n(1861.34, 1867.26)  forgiveness of sins. Do this in memory of me.\n(1873.58, 1878.06)  The mystery of faith\n(1882.06, 1878.06) \n(1899.46, 1903.06)  When we eat this bread and drink this cup, We proclaim your death, O Lord, until you come again.\n(1903.06, 1908.06)  Therefore, as we celebrate the memorial of his death and resurrection, we offer\n(1908.06, 1913.5)  you, Lord, the bread of life and the chalice of salvation, giving thanks that\n(1913.5, 1919.2)  you have held us worthy to be in your presence and minister to you. Humbly we\n(1919.2, 1923.62)  pray that partaking of the body and blood of Christ we may be gathered into\n(1923.62, 1928.98)  one by the Holy Spirit. Remember, Lord, your church spread throughout the world\n(1928.98, 1935.02)  and bring her to the fullness of charity together with Leo our Pope and Richard\n(1935.02, 1940.36)  our Bishop and all the clergy. Remember also our brothers and sisters who have\n(1940.36, 1945.4)  fallen asleep in the hope of the resurrection and all who have died in\n(1945.4, 1951.72)  your mercy welcome them into the light of your face. Have mercy on us all we\n(1951.72, 1956.96)  pray that with the Blessed Virgin Mary Mother of God St. Joseph her spouse with\n(1956.96, 1960.2)  the blessed apostles, St. Bridget, St. Augustine,\n(1960.2, 1964.24)  and all the saints who have pleased you throughout the ages,\n(1964.24, 1967.56)  that we may merit to be co-heirs to eternal life\n(1967.56, 1969.56)  and may praise and glorify you\n(1969.56, 1972.2)  through your son, Jesus Christ.\n(1973.88, 1977.96)  Through him and with him and in him,\n(1977.96, 1982.96)  O God, almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\n(1985.58, 1982.96) \n(1992.24, 1997.24)  Spirit, all glory and honor is yours forever and ever.\n(2003.72, 2011.84)  Amen, amen, amen.\n(2003.72, 2016.96)  At the Savior's command and formed by divine teaching, we dare to pray now.\n(2016.96, 2017.96)  Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.\n(2017.96, 2026.96)  Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.\n(2026.96, 2033.48)  Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive, though\n(2033.48, 2041.52)  those who trespass against us, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.\n(2041.52, 2046.4)  Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil, graciously grant peace in our days, that by\n(2046.4, 2052.48)  the help of your mercy we may be always free from sin and safe from all distress, as we\n(2052.48, 2056.28)  await the blessed hope and the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ.\n(2056.28, 2061.72)  For the Kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours, now and forever.\n(2061.72, 2066.28)  Jesus Christ who said to your apostles peace I leave you my peace I give you\n(2066.28, 2070.96)  look not now on our sins but on the faith of your church and graciously\n(2070.96, 2074.88)  grant your peace and unity in accordance with your will who live and reign\n(2074.88, 2081.64)  forever and ever the peace of the Lord be with you always let's offer each\n(2081.64, 2085.52)  other some sign of Christ's peace\n(2091.72, 2112.72)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(2112.72, 2121.2)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world.\n(2121.2, 2126.2)  Have mercy on us.\n(2126.2, 2135.68)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world.\n(2135.68, 2139.18)  Grant us peace.\n(2142.72, 2149.68)  Behold the Lamb of God, behold him who takes away the sins of the world, blessed are those\n(2149.68, 2151.84)  called to the Supper of the Lamb.\n(2151.84, 2157.8)  Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof, but only say the word and my\n(2157.8, 2161.08)  soul shall be healed.\n(2188.78, 2199.28)  Taste and see the goodness of the Lord,\n(2199.28, 2205.76)  the goodness of the Lord.\n(2205.76, 2216.24)  Taste and see the goodness of the Lord,\n(2216.24, 2228.82)  the goodness of the Lord.\n(2246.24, 2264.6)  The Lord has eyes for the just, And ears for their cry,\n(2264.6, 2275.6)  The Lord has eyes for the just, And ears for their cry,\n(2275.6, 2291.6)  The Lord confronts the evildoers To destroy remembrance of them from the earth.\n(2291.6, 2308.08)  taste, and see the goodness\n(2314.98, 2308.08) \n(2321.6, 2337.28)  The Lord hears them when the just cry out, and from all their distress he rescues them.

534.0)  Let us pray.\n(534.32, 540.16)  O God, who in the abasement of your Son have raised up a fallen world, fill your\n(540.16, 543.6)  faithful with holy joy. For on those you have rescued from\n(543.6, 548.0)  slavery to sin, you bestow eternal gladness. Through our\n(548.0, 554.04)  Lord Jesus Christ, your son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\n(554.04, 563.92)  God forever and ever.\n(563.92, 567.04)  A reading from the book of the prophet Isaiah.\n(567.04, 575.72)  Thus says the Lord, rejoice with Jerusalem and be glad because of her, all you who love\n(575.72, 583.68)  of her, exult with her all you who were mourning over her.\n(583.68, 587.56)  Oh, that you may suck fully of the milk of her comfort,\n(587.56, 591.64)  that you may nurse with delight at her abundant breasts.\n(591.64, 597.04)  For thus says the Lord, lo, I will spread prosperity\n(597.04, 601.68)  over Jerusalem like a river, and the wealth of the nations\n(601.68, 604.48)  like an overflowing torrent.\n(604.48, 608.52)  As nurselings, you shall be carried in her arms\n(608.52, 610.88)  and fondled in her lap.\n(610.88, 615.88)  As a mother comforts her child, so will I comfort you.\n(616.28, 619.6)  In Jerusalem, you shall find your comfort.\n(621.0, 624.88)  When you see this, your heart shall rejoice\n(624.88, 628.64)  and your bodies shall flourish like the grass.\n(628.64, 632.58)  The Lord's power shall be known to his servants.\n(632.58, 633.78)  The word of the Lord.\n(634.48, 660.48)  Let all the earth cry out for thee, O Lord, for thee I am.\n(660.48, 661.48)  Let all the earth cry out for thee, O Lord, for thee I am.\n(661.48, 662.48)  Let all the earth cry out for thee, O Lord, for thee I am.\n(662.48, 663.48)  Let all the earth cry out for thee, O Lord, for thee I am.\n(663.48, 664.46)  Let all the earth cry out for thee, O Lord, for thee I am.\n(664.46, 683.74)  Let all the earth cry out to God with joy.\n(683.74, 689.54)  Shout joyfully to God, all the earth.\n(689.54, 694.98)  Sing praise to the glory of his name.\n(694.98, 700.02)  Proclaim his glorious praise.\n(700.02, 707.46)  Say to God, how tremendous are your deeds.\n(707.46, 718.9)  Let all the earth cry out to God with joy.\n(718.9, 730.26)  Let all on earth worship and sing praise to you, sing praise to your name.\n(730.26, 743.06)  Come and see the works of God, his tremendous deeds among the children of Adam.\n(743.06, 754.42)  Let all the earth cry out to God with joy.\n(754.42, 761.22)  He has changed the scene to dry land.\n(761.22, 766.9)  Through the river they passed on foot.\n(766.9, 772.58)  Therefore, let us rejoice in Him.\n(772.58, 779.78)  He rules by His might forever.\n(779.78, 790.9)  Let all the earth cry out to God with joy.\n(790.9, 797.3)  Here now, all you who fear God,\n(797.3, 803.86)  while I declare what he has done for me.\n(803.86, 816.5)  Blessed be God, refused me not my prayer for his kindness.\n(816.5, 828.5)  Let all the earth cry out to God with joy.\n(843.62, 828.5) \n(848.18, 855.62)  A reading from the letter of St. Paul to the Galatians. Brothers and sisters, may I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through\n(855.62, 861.34)  through which the world has been crucified to me and I to the world.\n(861.34, 870.02)  For neither does circumcision mean anything, nor does uncircumcision, but only a new creation.\n(870.02, 876.78)  Peace and mercy be to all who follow this rule and to the Israel of God.\n(876.78, 885.46)  From now on, let no one make troubles for me, for I bear the marks of Jesus on my body.\n(885.46, 888.22)  the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,\n(888.22, 891.38)  be with your spirit, brothers and sisters.\n(891.38, 892.22)  Amen.\n(893.14, 894.34)  The word of the Lord.\n(899.02, 894.34) \n(915.34, 923.34)  Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah,\n(923.34, 943.34)  Let the peace of Christ control your hearts, let the word of Christ dwell in you richly.\n(943.34, 948.34)  Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.\n(954.92, 956.2)  The Lord be with you.\n(957.34, 960.08)  A reading from the Holy Gospel according to Luke.\n(963.46, 967.22)  At that time, the Lord appointed 72 others\n(967.22, 969.1)  whom he sent ahead of him in pairs\n(969.1, 972.24)  to every town and place he intended to visit.\n(972.24, 977.64)  He said to them, the harvest is abundant, but the laborers are few.\n(977.64, 982.38)  So ask the master of the harvest to send out laborers for his harvest.\n(982.38, 983.72)  Go on your way.\n(983.72, 987.76)  Behold, I am sending you like lambs among wolves.\n(987.76, 993.54)  Carry no money bag, no sack, no sandals, and greet no one along the way.\n(993.54, 998.08)  Into whatever house you enter, first say, peace to this household.\n(998.08, 999.96)  If a peaceful person lives there,\n(999.96, 1001.88)  your peace will rest on him,\n(1001.88, 1004.52)  but if not, it will return to you.\n(1004.52, 1006.84)  Stay in the same house and eat and drink\n(1006.84, 1008.28)  what is offered to you,\n(1008.28, 1010.84)  for the laborer deserves his payment.\n(1010.84, 1013.86)  Do not move about from one house to another.\n(1013.86, 1016.32)  Whatever town you enter and they welcome you,\n(1016.32, 1018.38)  eat what is said before you.\n(1018.38, 1020.62)  Cure the sick in it and say to them,\n(1020.62, 1022.88)  the kingdom of God is at hand for you.\n(1023.74, 1026.56)  Whatever town you enter and they do not receive you,\n(1026.56, 1028.84)  go out into the streets and say,\n(1028.84, 1031.58)  the dust of your town that clings to our feet,\n(1031.58, 1034.36)  even that we shake off against you.\n(1034.36, 1037.6)  You know this, the kingdom of God is at hand.\n(1037.6, 1040.16)  I tell you, it will be more tolerable\n(1040.16, 1043.32)  for Sodom on that day than for that town.\n(1043.32, 1046.24)  The 72 returned rejoicing and said,\n(1046.24, 1049.02)  Lord, even the demons are subject to us\n(1049.02, 1050.68)  because of your name.\n(1050.68, 1053.6)  Jesus said, I have observed Satan fall\n(1053.6, 1055.64)  like lightning from the sky.\n(1055.64, 1060.64)  behold I have given you the power to tread upon serpents and scorpions and\n(1060.64, 1066.4)  upon the full force of the enemy and nothing will harm you. Nevertheless do\n(1066.4, 1070.92)  not rejoice because the spirits are subject to you but rejoice because your\n(1070.92, 1076.36)  names are written in heaven. The gospel of the Lord.\n(1080.4, 1085.04)  The other day one of the parents of our toddlers in the school shared with me\n(1085.04, 1091.28)  that she uses the rectory as a landmark to let her son know when it's time to get off the bus.\n(1091.28, 1098.24)  She says we get off at Father Peter's house and she shared with me also the first time she pointed\n(1098.24, 1108.48)  out where the priests live her son said Father Peter's house is huge and I share this with you\n(1108.48, 1114.64)  because the kid was surprised by the rectory and the size and in his mind he thinks that\n(1115.04, 1121.52)  there's very few people living in there and he'd be correct what he doesn't understand of course\n(1121.52, 1129.04)  is that when the rectory was built in the mid 20th century it was designed to house between\n(1129.04, 1137.28)  six and ten priests and what that boy said brings us to the heart of today's gospel\n(1139.04, 1137.28) \n(1150.08, 1162.32)  them. The harvest is abundant, but the laborers are few. The harvest is abundant, but the laborers are few. Many people are starving to hear the love of God, but there aren't enough laborers\n(1162.32, 1174.16)  in the vineyard. And so Jesus says we need to ask, we need to ask the master of the harvest\n(1174.16, 1183.76)  to send out laborers for his harvest. Our rectories and our convents, our parishes, are shuttering.\n(1185.28, 1183.76) \n(1194.26, 1205.26)  not because God isn't calling men and women to live their entire life, to consecrate their whole being to his service, but because we aren't asking.\n(1205.26, 1215.1)  Every single Catholic has an obligation to pray and to ask God to send out\n(1215.1, 1223.78)  laborers in the harvest, not in some like generic way, but specifically from our\n(1223.78, 1233.34)  parish and our families. We are called to do this. It's part of our Commission.\n(1233.34, 1244.34)  Imagine how abundantly God would bless South Boston and the church, the Archdiocese and the church at large,\n(1244.34, 1253.34)  if every single one of us asked the Master for labors in the vineyard.\n(1253.34, 1262.34)  A source of reflection for us today, this Sunday, is to think, when's the last time I prayed for a vocation?\n(1262.34, 1274.4)  Have I ever prayed for a vocation? If we don't ask, so many people in the harvest\n(1274.4, 1284.1)  will not hear the love of God. And so I beg you to join me in this quest to ask\n(1284.1, 1292.5)  ask God to send men and women to renew the priesthood and religious life.\n(1292.5, 1298.14)  But the second and most important point of today's Gospel is this.\n(1298.14, 1307.58)  The Kingdom of God, the obligation to build the Kingdom of God, falls to all of us, all\n(1307.58, 1310.3)  of those in the 72.\n(1310.3, 1315.1)  You see, the 72, those who were appointed by the Lord to go out and spread the good\n(1315.1, 1321.14)  news and to say the kingdom of God is among you, they were not priests, those people.\n(1321.14, 1329.68)  They were ordinary men and women, like you and me, who heard the call to go and spread\n(1329.68, 1333.96)  the good news, to have the word of God on their lips.\n(1333.96, 1339.42)  Their encounter with Jesus was not privatized, not something they kept hidden from the world.\n(1339.42, 1342.82)  They went out and they shared it.\n(1342.82, 1346.72)  When all of us were baptized, the priest says a prayer.\n(1346.72, 1351.82)  He traces the sign of the cross over your ears so you will always hear the word of God\n(1351.82, 1357.0)  and then on your lips so that you will proclaim it.\n(1357.0, 1365.34)  It's part of the prophetic dimension of your baptism to share the kingdom of God.\n(1365.34, 1366.52)  Think of it like this.\n(1366.52, 1375.72)  The Lord, He counts on you, in your schools, in your jobs, on our streets, in your families,\n(1375.72, 1385.56)  to be the witness that shows people the joy of living in the kingdom of God.\n(1385.56, 1392.68)  God can't reach the people in the harvest if we don't start to labor.\n(1392.68, 1399.24)  And to see it as essential to our mission to bring the joy and everything we receive\n(1399.24, 1402.92)  from inside this beautiful church to our streets.\n(1402.92, 1406.68)  Being fed by the Eucharist so we can feed others.\n(1406.68, 1417.98)  When all of us start to pray daily and to share our faith, our rectories and our convents\n(1417.98, 1420.68)  will be filled again.\n(1420.68, 1425.48)  And our brothers and sisters will know the peace and the joy from realizing that the\n(1425.48, 1429.32)  kingdom of God is among us.\n(1429.32, 1432.08)  I leave you with this.\n(1432.08, 1439.7)  The final words of every Mass are, go forth, the Mass has ended.\n(1439.7, 1442.32)  Go forth.\n(1442.32, 1448.8)  In other words, we're commissioned by our baptism, by the strength of the Eucharist\n(1448.8, 1453.76)  to go into the streets and tell people the good news\n(1453.76, 1458.76)  that the kingdom of God is among us and it is for them.\n(1471.82, 1474.32)  And so let us stand and profess our faith.\n(1475.46, 1474.32) \n(1483.32, 1490.32)  I believe in one God, the Father almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all things visible and invisible. I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, born of the Father before all ages,\n(1490.32, 1497.32)  God from God, light from light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, consubstantial with the Father.\n(1497.32, 1502.32)  Through him all things were made. For us men and for our salvation he came down from heaven,\n(1502.32, 1507.84)  and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate of the Virgin Mary and became man. For our\n(1507.84, 1512.12)  sake who is crucified under Pontius Pilate, he suffered death and was buried,\n(1512.12, 1516.4)  and rose again on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures. He\n(1516.4, 1520.44)  ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will\n(1520.44, 1524.4)  come again in glory to judge the living and the dead, and his kingdom will have\n(1524.4, 1530.04)  no end. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from\n(1530.04, 1534.84)  the Father and the Son, who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified, who has\n(1534.84, 1540.72)  spoken through the prophets. I believe in one holy catholic and apostolic church.

Lord have mercy.\n(355.64, 374.5)  And on earth peace to people of good will We praise you, we bless you, we adore you\n(374.5, 383.0)  We glorify you, we give you thanks for your great glory\n(383.0, 412.62)  Lord God, Lamb of God, Son of the Father,\n(412.62, 425.3)  You take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(425.3, 437.98)  You take away the sins of the world, receive our prayer.\n(437.98, 447.98)  You are seated at the right hand of the Father.\n(447.98, 456.98)  Have mercy on us.\n(456.98, 461.98)  For you alone are the Holy One.\n(461.98, 466.98)  You alone are the Lord.\n(466.98, 487.62)  alone are the most high. Jesus Christ with the Holy Spirit in the glory of God the Father. Amen.\n(490.74, 491.46)  Let us pray.\n(493.86, 491.46) \n(499.68, 504.94)  O God, who in the abasement of your Son have raised up a fallen world, fill your faithful with holy joy, for on those who have rescued from slavery to sin, you\n(504.94, 510.26)  bestow eternal gladness. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and\n(510.26, 516.26)  reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God forever and ever.\n(521.46, 527.7)  A reading from the book of the prophet Isaiah.\n(527.7, 534.66)  Thus says the Lord, rejoice with Jerusalem and be glad because of her.\n(534.66, 542.06)  All you who love her, exult, exult with her, all you who are mourning over her.\n(542.06, 548.38)  O, that you may suck fully of the milk of her comfort, that you may nurse with delight\n(548.38, 550.86)  at her abundant breasts.\n(550.86, 558.02)  For thus, says the Lord, lo, I will spread prosperity over Jerusalem like a river, and\n(558.02, 562.12)  the wealth of the nations like an overflowing torrent.\n(562.12, 568.28)  As nurses, you shall be carried in her arms and fondled in her lap.\n(568.28, 573.44)  As a mother comforts her child, so will I comfort you.\n(573.44, 576.94)  In Jerusalem you shall find your comfort.\n(576.94, 583.04)  When you see this, your heart shall rejoice and your bodies flourish like the grass.\n(583.04, 586.42)  The Lord's power shall be known to his servants.\n(586.42, 587.52)  The word of the Lord.\n(606.94, 624.94)  Let all the earth cry out to God with joy.\n(624.94, 635.94)  Let all the earth cry out to God with joy.\n(635.94, 651.14)  Shout joyfully to God, all the earth, sing praise to the glory of his name.\n(651.14, 664.66)  Proclaim his glorious praise, say to God, how tremendous are your deeds.\n(664.66, 675.66)  Let all the earth cry out to God with joy.\n(675.66, 682.66)  Let all on earth worship and sing praise to you.\n(682.66, 686.66)  Sing praise to your name.\n(686.66, 691.66)  Come and see the works of God.\n(691.66, 699.66)  His tremendous deeds among the children of Adam.\n(699.66, 711.66)  Let all the earth cry out to God with joy.\n(711.66, 717.66)  He has changed the sea into dry land.\n(717.66, 722.66)  Through the river they passed on foot.\n(722.66, 727.66)  Therefore let us rejoice in him.\n(727.66, 733.66)  He rules by his might forever.\n(733.66, 745.66)  Let all the earth cry out to God with joy.\n(745.66, 758.06)  Hear now, all you who fear God, while I declare what he has done for me.\n(758.06, 770.22)  Blessed be God, refused me not my prayer or his kindness.\n(770.22, 781.26)  Let all the earth cry out to God with joy.\n(794.38, 798.14)  A reading from the letter of Saint Paul to the Galatians.\n(798.14, 805.66)  Brothers and sisters, may I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through\n(805.66, 811.14)  which the world has been crucified to me and I to the world.\n(811.14, 823.32)  For neither does circumcision mean anything, nor does uncircumcision, but only a new creation.\n(823.32, 829.54)  Peace and mercy be to all who follow this rule and to the Israel of God.\n(829.54, 838.04)  From now on, let no one make troubles for me, for I bear the mark of Jesus on my body.\n(838.04, 845.24)  The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers and sisters, amen.\n(845.24, 846.4)  The word of the Lord.\n(853.32, 881.32)  Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah.\n(881.32, 887.96)  Let the peace of Christ control your hearts.\n(887.96, 894.84)  Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly.\n(894.84, 905.8)  Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.\n(906.6, 911.24)  The Lord be with you. A reading from the holy gospel according to\n(911.24, 919.58)  Luke at that time the Lord appointed 72 others whom he sent ahead of him in\n(919.58, 925.98)  pairs to every town in place he intended to visit he said to them the harvest is\n(925.98, 932.0)  abundant but the laborers are few so ask the master of the harvest to send out\n(932.0, 938.66)  laborers for his harvest go on your way behold I am sending you like lambs among\n(938.66, 944.46)  wolves, carry no money bag, no sack, no sandals, and greet no one along the way.\n(944.46, 950.12)  And to whatever house you enter, first say peace to this household. If a\n(950.12, 955.38)  peaceful person lives there, your peace will rest on him, but if not, it will\n(955.38, 959.94)  return to you. Stay in the same house and eat and drink what is offered to you,\n(959.94, 965.42)  for the laborer deserves his payment. Do not move about from one house to another.\n(965.42, 970.88)  whatever town you enter and they welcome you, eat what is set before you, cure the\n(970.88, 976.28)  sick in it, and say to them, the kingdom of God is at hand for you. Whatever town\n(976.28, 981.56)  you enter and they do not receive you, go out into the streets and say, the dust of\n(981.56, 986.84)  your town that clings to our feet, even that we shake off against you. Yet know\n(986.84, 993.0)  this, the kingdom of God is at hand. I tell you, it will be more tolerable for\n(993.0, 998.92)  for Sodom on that day than for that town. The 72 returned rejoicing and said Lord\n(998.92, 1004.84)  even the demons are subject to us because of your name. Jesus said I have\n(1004.84, 1009.88)  observed Satan fall like lightning from the sky behold I have given you the\n(1009.88, 1014.36)  power to tread upon serpents and scorpions and upon the full force of the\n(1014.36, 1019.96)  enemy and nothing will harm you. Nevertheless do not rejoice because the\n(1019.96, 1025.0)  spirits are subject to you, but rejoice because your names are written in heaven.\n(1025.0, 1036.16)  The gospel of the Lord. One of the parents of a toddler in our early\n(1036.16, 1041.92)  childhood program told me that she refers to the bus station right near the\n(1041.92, 1046.4)  rectory where they get off to go to school as the stop next to Father\n(1046.4, 1052.16)  Peter's house and so the boy knows that that's where he gets off and he and she\n(1052.16, 1056.08)  pointed out the rectory to this child and said that's where father Peter lives\n(1056.08, 1065.8)  and she also shared with me that her son said father Peter's house is huge and I\n(1065.8, 1071.2)  share this with you because this boy noticed even from a young age that that\n(1071.2, 1080.28)  That house is very big, and it seems strange that so few people live in such a big house.\n(1080.28, 1084.32)  And what this boy, of course, doesn't understand is when that house was built in the early\n(1084.32, 1093.74)  1900s, there was between six and ten priests living in that house.\n(1093.74, 1097.64)  This brings us right to the heart of today's Gospel.\n(1097.64, 1106.12)  Jesus says the harvest is abundant, but the laborers are few.\n(1106.12, 1110.34)  The harvest is abundant, but the laborers are few.\n(1110.34, 1120.12)  There are so many people starving to hear the love of God, to have the love of Christ\n(1120.12, 1124.76)  penetrate their darkness and their loneliness.\n(1124.76, 1132.36)  But there aren't enough laborers to share the good news.\n(1132.36, 1140.06)  It's so important for us to see that our rectories and our convents in our churches, which are\n(1140.06, 1150.38)  being shuttered, is not because God has stopped calling men and women to give their entire\n(1150.38, 1152.78)  lives to Him.\n(1152.78, 1158.48)  To be completely consecrated to spreading the kingdom of heaven.\n(1158.48, 1166.72)  It's because we've stopped asking for laborers to be sent out into the vineyard.\n(1166.72, 1172.48)  Jesus says this, the harvest is abundant but the laborers are few.\n(1172.48, 1179.38)  So ask the master of the harvest to send out laborers for his harvest.\n(1179.38, 1186.34)  Every single one of us has an obligation to pray for vocations to the priesthood and to\n(1186.34, 1189.96)  the religious life.\n(1189.96, 1197.48)  Without the laborers, people don't encounter the love of God, and they can't experience\n(1197.48, 1202.98)  the joy of heaven, the kingdom of God.\n(1202.98, 1208.54)  Nothing is accomplished in the church severed from prayer.\n(1208.54, 1215.54)  Vocations to the religious life in the priesthood, they don't grow on trees.\n(1215.54, 1226.54)  They come from our families and our parishioners from people who beg the master to send laborers to the vineyard.\n(1226.54, 1232.54)  A practical question for us to contemplate as we're thrusted back into ordinary time\n(1232.54, 1239.94)  is when is the last time you prayed specifically for a vocation to the\n(1239.94, 1247.82)  priesthood or to the religious life? Maybe it's a prayer you've never uttered. Now\n(1247.82, 1255.98)  is the time to start because the harvest is abundant but the laborers are few. But\n(1255.98, 1260.42)  the second and final point of today's gospel which is more important for us is\n(1260.42, 1268.42)  is to see that the kingdom of God was built by the 72.\n(1268.42, 1277.42)  The 72 that Jesus sends out two by two to preach the kingdom of God, they were not priests.\n(1277.42, 1283.42)  They were ordinary men and women like you and me who spread the good news\n(1283.42, 1288.42)  and who went before the Lord and said the kingdom of God is at hand.\n(1288.42, 1291.76)  Every time you come to mass and we hear the gospel\n(1291.76, 1297.92)  We trace the sign of the cross on our forehead our lips and on our heart to stay as a gesture\n(1298.7, 1306.02)  That the Word of God shapes my mind the way I think it's on my lips the way that I speak and it's in my heart\n(1306.02, 1308.02)  And it shapes what I love\n(1309.38, 1313.14)  That part of the Word of God being on our lips is so important\n(1314.62, 1313.14) \n(1322.14, 1332.14)  Because people do not encounter Christ if we don't bring Him to the streets. If we privatize our faith, if we keep the Lord off of our lips, people don't hear the good news.\n(1332.14, 1336.14)  All of us are part of the 72.\n(1336.14, 1338.14)  It's part of our baptismal promise.\n(1338.14, 1346.08)  We're commissioned in the prophetic mission of Christ to go and proclaim that the kingdom of God is among us and\n(1346.88, 1348.88)  So we have this obligation\n(1349.72, 1356.46)  One of the great priests who was here many years ago father white he often used to say I've read many of his sermons\n(1356.46, 1359.66)  He would say this and I love this line. He says the kingdom of God\n(1361.08, 1363.08)  ends up poorer if\n(1363.76, 1365.76)  You do not respond\n(1366.58, 1365.76) \n(1373.32, 1377.82)  That is so true. There are places in our society that only you can reach, only you can bring the love of Christ there to those people in your offices, in your\n(1377.82, 1386.04)  schools, and your families that are starving to hear it. We are sent forward\n(1386.04, 1390.7)  at every Mass. I will leave you with this. The last words the priest says at the\n(1390.7, 1400.22)  mass. Our go forth, the mass is ended. This is a command to live the Great\n(1400.22, 1405.94)  Commission, to be fed by the Word of God in the Eucharist, his body, blood, soul, and\n(1405.94, 1413.7)  divinity, and to bring it out into the streets. Once we start praying boldly for\n(1413.7, 1419.78)  more laborers, and once we start living this commission and sharing the joy of\n(1419.78, 1424.66)  of the kingdom of God amongst our brothers and sisters, our rectuaries and\n(1424.66, 1430.3)  convents and parishes will be filled again.\n(1440.46, 1447.7)  And so let us stand and profess our faith. I believe in one God, the Father\n(1447.7, 1452.82)  Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all things visible and invisible, I\n(1452.82, 1458.34)  believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, born of the\n(1458.34, 1463.74)  Father before all ages, God from God, light from light, true God from true God,\n(1463.74, 1468.66)  begotten not made consubstantial with the Father, through him all things were\n(1468.66, 1473.82)  made. For us men and for our salvation he came down from heaven and by the Holy\n(1473.82, 1478.82)  Spirit was incarnate of the Virgin Mary and became man. For our sake he was\n(1478.82, 1483.42)  crucified under Pontius Pilate, he suffered death and was buried, and rose\n(1483.42, 1487.5)  again on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures. He ascended into\n(1487.5, 1491.66)  heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will come again in\n(1491.66, 1495.78)  glory to judge the living and the dead, and his kingdom will have no end. I\n(1495.78, 1500.86)  believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from the\n(1500.86, 1505.46)  Father and the Son, who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified, who\n(1505.46, 1509.82)  has spoken through the prophets. I believe in one holy Catholic and\n(1509.82, 1515.14)  apostolic Church. I confess one baptism for the forgiveness of sins, and I look\n(1515.14, 1519.54)  forward to the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come. Amen.\n(1519.54, 1524.06)  Turning towards our Heavenly Father with great confidence, we make our petitions\n(1524.06, 1530.3)  known to him. We pray that God may grant his love and wisdom to our Holy Father\n(1530.3, 1535.82)  Pope Leo that he may be conscious that he is an instrument of the Lord and he\n(1535.82, 1541.14)  seeks to serve and lead the church we pray to the Lord Lord hear our prayer\n(1541.14, 1546.46)  we pray that world leaders may be blessed with the compassion of Christ in\n(1546.46, 1552.86)  serving their people we pray to the Lord Lord hear our prayer we pray for those\n(1552.86, 1557.54)  who are traveling on vacation they like disciples they may travel light and\n(1557.54, 1562.94)  bring peace with them and not forget the God that accompanies them. We pray to\n(1562.94, 1568.78)  the Lord. Lord hear our prayer. For all those affected by the Texas floods on\n(1568.78, 1573.22)  Friday, we pray especially for the families who have lost children and\n(1573.22, 1580.18)  loved ones. We pray to the Lord. Lord hear our prayer. We pray for all those who\n(1580.18, 1586.58)  seek healing. May Jesus, the divine physician, bring them health and peace. We\n(1586.58, 1592.66)  pray to the Lord. Lord hear our prayer. We pray for our dead, especially our\n(1592.66, 1597.92)  parishioners for whom this Mass is offered.

The Lord be with you. Lift up your hearts.\n(21.26, 28.82)  Let us give thanks to the Lord our God. It is truly right and just our duty and\n(28.82, 34.84)  our salvation, always and everywhere to give you thanks, Lord, Holy Father, Almighty and\n(34.84, 36.88)  Eternal God.\n(36.88, 42.28)  For in goodness you created man, and when he was justly condemned, in mercy you redeemed\n(42.28, 45.08)  him through Christ our Lord.\n(45.08, 48.08)  Through him the angels praise your majesty.\n(48.08, 53.76)  May our voices, we pray, join with theirs in humble praise as we now acclaim.\n(53.76, 58.56)  Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts,\n(58.56, 61.44)  heaven and earth are full of your glory,\n(61.44, 63.52)  Hosanna in the highest.\n(63.52, 67.04)  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord,\n(67.04, 68.94)  Hosanna in the highest.\n(70.64, 74.28)  You are indeed holy, O Lord, the fount of all holiness.\n(74.28, 77.32)  Make holy, therefore, these gifts, we pray,\n(77.32, 81.16)  by sending down your Spirit upon them like the dewfall,\n(81.16, 82.92)  so that they may become for us\n(82.92, 86.9)  the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.\n(86.9, 88.94)  At the time he was betrayed\n(88.94, 91.7)  and entered willingly into his passion.\n(91.7, 93.56)  He took bread and giving thanks,\n(93.56, 96.88)  broke it and gave it to his disciples saying,\n(96.88, 99.82)  take this all of you and eat of it.\n(99.82, 103.58)  For this is my body, which will be given up for you.\n(111.58, 112.74)  In a similar way,\n(112.74, 115.06)  when supper was ended, he took the chalice,\n(115.06, 116.62)  and once more, giving thanks,\n(116.62, 119.26)  he gave it to his disciples, saying,\n(119.26, 122.02)  take this, all of you, and drink from it,\n(122.02, 124.14)  for this is the chalice of my blood,\n(124.14, 126.78)  the blood of the new and eternal covenant,\n(126.78, 129.14)  which will be poured out for you and for many\n(129.14, 131.38)  for the forgiveness of sins.\n(131.38, 133.78)  Do this in memory of me.\n(133.78, 149.5)  The mystery of faith. We proclaim your death, O Lord, and profess your\n(149.5, 155.74)  resurrection until you come again. Therefore, as we celebrate the memorial\n(155.74, 159.58)  of his death and resurrection, we offer you, Lord, the bread of life and the\n(159.58, 165.1)  chalice of salvation, giving thanks that you have held us worthy to be in your\n(165.1, 170.9)  presence and minister to you.

Remember also our brothers and sisters who have fallen asleep in the\n(190.86, 196.66)  hope of the resurrection, and all who have died in your mercy, welcome them into the\n(196.66, 202.94)  light of your face.

        "transcript": "(238.0, 244.96)  Good morning, everyone.\n(244.96, 250.64)  In your prayers today, we'd ask you to remember John, Mary, and Jack Tynan, for whom this\n(250.64, 252.24)  Mass is offered.\n(252.24, 257.36)  In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, the grace of our Lord\n(257.36, 262.04)  Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with all of\n(262.04, 264.52)  you.\n(264.52, 270.44)  ourselves for the Eucharist today, we call to mind God's love and ask His mercy and His forgiveness.\n(274.28, 284.2)  Lord have mercy. Christ have mercy. Lord have mercy. May almighty God have mercy on us,\n(284.2, 289.64)  forgive us our sins, and bring us to everlasting life. Let us pray.\n(293.48, 289.64) \n(301.04, 308.08)  Show favor, O Lord, to Your servants and mercifully increase the gifts of Your grace, that made fervent in hope, faith, and charity, they may be ever watchful in keeping Your commands.\n(308.08, 312.12)  Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Your Son, who lives and reigns with You in the unity of\n(312.12, 315.36)  the Holy Spirit, God forever and ever.\n(327.16, 330.44)  A reading from the book of Exodus.\n(330.44, 335.0)  Although Moses and Aaron performed various wonders\n(335.0, 340.0)  in Pharaoh's presence, the Lord made Pharaoh obstinate,\n(340.6, 340.0) \n(345.0, 350.0)  and he would not let the children of Israel leave his land. The Lord said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt,\n(350.0, 355.0)  This month shall stand at the head of your calendar.\n(355.0, 360.0)  You shall reckon it the first month of the year.\n(360.0, 364.0)  Tell the whole community of Israel,\n(364.0, 369.0)  On the tenth of this month every one of your families\n(369.0, 376.0)  families must procure for itself a lamb, one apiece for each household. If a family is\n(378.76, 385.76)  too small for a whole lamb, it shall join the nearest household in procuring one and\n(385.96, 392.96)  shall shear in the lamb in proportion to the number of people who partake of it. The lamb\n(394.48, 392.96) \n(399.54, 403.48)  The lamb must be a year old male and without blemish. You may take it from either the sheep or the goat.\n(403.48, 410.16)  You shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this month, and then with the whole assembly\n(410.16, 417.1)  of Israel present it shall be slaughtered during the evening twilight.\n(417.1, 423.42)  They shall take some of its blood and apply it to the two door-posts in the lintel of\n(423.42, 428.94)  every house in which they partake of the lamb.\n(428.94, 437.68)  That same night they shall eat its roasted flesh with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.\n(437.68, 446.16)  It shall not be eaten raw or boiled, but roasted whole, with its head and shanks and inner\n(446.16, 455.92)  organs. None of it must be kept beyond the next morning. Whatever is left over in the\n(455.92, 465.88)  morning shall be burned up. This is how you shall eat it. With your loins girt, sandals\n(465.88, 474.6)  on your feet, and your staff in hand, you shall eat like those who are in flight. It\n(474.6, 481.6)  is the Passover of the Lord. For on this same night I will go through Egypt, striking down\n(484.18, 491.18)  every firstborn of the land, both man and beast, and executing judgment on all the gods\n(492.58, 499.58)  of Egypt, I the Lord. But the blood will mark the houses where you are. Seeing the blood,\n(503.12, 499.58) \n(509.88, 519.4)  are. Seeing the blood, I will pass over you. Thus, when I strike the land of Egypt, no destructive blow will come upon you. This day shall be a memorial feast for you, which\n(519.4, 529.46)  all your generations shall celebrate with pilgrimage to the Lord as a perpetual institution.\"\n(529.46, 536.46)  Word of the Lord. I will take the cup of salvation and call on the name of the Lord. I will take\n(540.86, 546.7)  the cup of salvation and call on the name of the Lord. How shall I make a return to\n(546.7, 553.7)  the Lord for all the good He has done for me? The cup of salvation I will take up and\n(554.56, 553.7) \n(558.46, 564.3)  and I will call upon the name of the Lord. I will take the cup of salvation and call on the name of the Lord.\n(564.3, 570.34)  Precious in the eyes of the Lord is the depth of his faithful ones.\n(570.34, 575.04)  I am your servant, the son of your handmaid.\n(575.04, 577.82)  You have loosed my bonds.\n(577.82, 583.22)  I will take the cup of salvation and call on the name of the Lord.\n(583.22, 591.12)  To you will I offer sacrifice of thanksgiving, and I will call upon the name of the Lord.\n(591.12, 596.02)  My vows to the Lord I will pay in the presence of all his people.\n(596.02, 601.02)  I will take the cup of salvation and call on the name of the Lord.\n(613.22, 626.34)  The Lord be with you.\n(626.34, 633.18)  A reading from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew.\n(633.18, 638.26)  Jesus was going through a field of grain on the Sabbath.\n(638.26, 644.18)  His disciples were hungry and began to pick the heads of grain and eat them.\n(644.18, 650.02)  When the Pharisees saw this they said to him, See, your disciples are doing what is unlawful\n(650.02, 653.12)  to do on the Sabbath.\n(653.12, 660.16)  He said to them, Have you not read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?\n(660.16, 664.72)  How he went into the house of God and ate the bread of offering, which neither he nor\n(664.72, 670.48)  his companions, but only the priests could lawfully eat.\n(670.48, 675.28)  Or have you not read in the law that on the Sabbath the priests serving in the temple\n(675.28, 679.04)  violate the Sabbath and are innocent?\n(679.04, 685.4)  I say to you, something greater than the temple is here.\n(685.4, 693.0)  If you knew what this meant, I desire mercy, not sacrifice, you would not have condemned\n(693.0, 708.64)  these innocent men. For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.\" The Gospel of the Lord.\n(708.64, 715.44)  In our first reading today from the book of Exodus, we hear the final plague before Israel's\n(715.44, 722.12)  liberation the death of the firstborn. It's a solemn and fearsome moment in\n(722.12, 730.16)  salvation history for the Jewish people. Yet it is paired with God's institution\n(730.16, 737.24)  of the Passover. God tells his people how to be saved. Mark your doorposts with the\n(737.24, 744.12)  blood of the Lamb and the destroyer will pass over you. The scene of course\n(744.12, 751.76)  for shadows the sacrifice of Christ on the cross, the true lamb of God, whose blood saves\n(751.76, 758.72)  us not from physical death, but from eternal separation from God.\n(758.72, 765.62)  The Passover was not only about escape from Egypt, it was about becoming God's people\n(765.62, 769.7)  set apart to live in His covenant.\n(769.7, 774.98)  Even in the gospel today, Jesus and his disciples are walking through the grain fields on the\n(774.98, 782.6)  Sabbath, and his disciples begin to pluck the heads of grain, and the Pharisees criticize\n(782.6, 791.96)  this as unlawful, but Jesus responds by reminding them of David, and more importantly, by revealing\n(791.96, 794.64)  what the heart of God says.\n(794.64, 798.74)  I desire mercy, not sacrifice.\n(798.74, 802.02)  I desire mercy, not sacrifice.\n(803.24, 807.74)  What Jesus is showing us is that rituals like the Sabbath,\n(807.74, 812.74)  like Passover, only have meaning when they flow from\n(813.68, 816.92)  and lead to a relationship with God,\n(816.92, 820.96)  and a relationship that is marked by mercy, justice,\n(820.96, 821.8)  and love.\n(823.52, 827.2)  So today's readings remind us that God is both just\n(827.2, 829.12)  and merciful.\n(829.12, 830.58)  He does not ignore sin,\n(830.58, 835.26)  but he always provides a way to forgiveness and salvation.\n(837.02, 839.36)  Maybe we can be attentive to the ways\n(839.36, 844.08)  that we sometimes cling to external observance\n(844.08, 849.08)  while neglecting mercy, love, and compassion.\n(850.4, 854.04)  Like the Israelites, hopefully we will be marked\n(854.04, 857.64)  in our spiritual life by the blood of the lamb\n(857.64, 861.0)  and live lives that reflect the mercy\n(861.0, 863.92)  we ourselves have received from God.\n(865.58, 870.38)  I desire mercy, not sacrifice.\n(870.38, 874.64)  May those words challenge us today to be people of mercy,\n(874.64, 879.64)  not just in our rituals, but in every moment of our lives.\n(882.36, 883.28)  Let us pray.\n(884.04, 890.46)  Let us call upon God to hear the prayers we offer today.\n(890.46, 892.2)  We pray for God's Holy Church.\n(892.2, 897.8)  May the Holy Spirit draw us ever closer to perfect union with Him and with one another.\n(897.8, 900.86)  We pray to the Lord.\n(900.86, 906.58)  For all nations and peoples of the world, may the Lord bring peace, hope, and protection\n(906.58, 911.3)  to all those who are in need, especially in war-torn countries.\n(911.3, 912.84)  we pray to the Lord.\n(915.18, 917.02)  For the elderly who are alone,\n(917.02, 919.4)  may the Lord console them with His presence\n(919.4, 921.58)  and comfort them with friendship,\n(921.58, 923.32)  we pray to the Lord.\n(925.34, 928.28)  For all the sick, those in hospital or nursing home,\n(928.28, 931.36)  those undergoing surgery or treatment today,\n(931.36, 934.22)  that God's healing presence may be with them,\n(934.22, 935.96)  we pray to the Lord.\n(938.08, 935.96) \n(938.04, 941.4)  Lord, hear our prayer. For all who have died marked with the sign of faith,\n(941.4, 944.4)  and today we remember John, Mary, and Jack Tynan\n(944.4, 946.1)  for whom this mass is offered.\n(947.04, 950.12)  May God welcome them into his eternal kingdom,\n(950.12, 951.84)  we pray to the Lord.\n(951.84, 953.56)  Lord, hear our prayer.\n(953.56, 955.78)  We thank you, Father, for hearing our prayers,\n(955.78, 959.08)  and we ask that you grant them according to your will.\n(959.08, 961.88)  We ask them through Christ our Lord.\n(961.88, 962.72)  Amen.\n(995.96, 1020.72)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through your goodness we have received\n(1020.72, 1025.46)  the bread we offer you, fruit of the earth and work of human hands, it will become for\n(1025.46, 1029.9)  us the bread of life.\n(1029.9, 1033.94)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through your goodness we have received\n(1033.94, 1039.62)  the wine we offer you, fruit of the vine and work of human hands that will become our spiritual\n(1039.62, 1040.14)  drink.\n(1055.46, 1064.46)  Pray, brothers and sisters, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God, the Almighty Father.\n(1074.46, 1080.46)  Accept, O Lord, we pray, the offerings which we bring from the abundance of Your gifts,\n(1080.46, 1093.46)  That through the powerful working of your grace these most sacred mysteries may sanctify our present way of life and lead us to eternal gladness through Christ our Lord.\n(1093.46, 1102.46)  The Lord be with you. Lift up your hearts. Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.\n(1102.46, 1108.82)  It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, always and everywhere to give you\n(1108.82, 1113.86)  thanks, Lord, Holy Father, Almighty and Eternal God.\n(1113.86, 1120.3)  For in goodness you created man, and when he was justly condemned, in mercy you redeemed\n(1120.3, 1122.86)  him through Christ our Lord.\n(1122.86, 1128.22)  Through him the angels praise your majesty, may our voices, we pray, join with theirs\n(1128.22, 1131.58)  in humble praise as we acclaim.\n(1131.58, 1138.82)  Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts, heaven and earth are full of your glory, Hosanna\n(1138.82, 1140.82)  in the highest.\n(1140.82, 1147.74)  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, Hosanna in the highest.\n(1147.74, 1151.62)  You are indeed holy, O Lord, the fount of all holiness.\n(1151.62, 1156.94)  Make holy, therefore, these gifts, we pray, by sending down your Spirit upon them like\n(1156.94, 1164.14)  the dewfall, so that they may become for us the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.\n(1164.14, 1170.14)  At the time He was betrayed and entered willingly into His passion, He took bread and, giving\n(1170.14, 1176.26)  thanks, broke it and gave it to His disciples, saying, Take this, all of you, and eat of\n(1176.26, 1191.72)  it for this is my body which will be given up for you in a similar way when\n(1191.72, 1196.42)  supper was ended he took the chalice and once more giving thanks he gave it to\n(1196.42, 1201.82)  his disciples saying take this all of you and drink from it but this is the\n(1201.82, 1206.98)  the chalice of my blood, the blood of the new and eternal covenant, which will be poured\n(1206.98, 1210.78)  out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins.\n(1210.78, 1223.22)  Do this in memory of me.\n(1223.22, 1225.0)  The mystery of faith.\n(1225.0, 1231.64)  We proclaim your death, O Lord, and profess your resurrection until you come again.\n(1231.64, 1236.64)  Therefore, as we celebrate the memorial of His death and resurrection, we offer you,\n(1236.64, 1241.86)  Lord, the bread of life and the chalice of salvation, giving thanks that you have held\n(1241.86, 1245.92)  us worthy to be in your presence and minister to you.\n(1245.92, 1251.36)  Humbly, we pray that, partaking of the body and blood of Christ, we may be gathered into\n(1251.36, 1253.56)  one by the Holy Spirit.\n(1253.56, 1258.84)  Remember, Lord, Your Church spread throughout the world and bring her to the fullness of\n(1258.84, 1266.24)  charity, together with Leo, our Pope, and Richard, our Bishop, and all the clergy.\n(1266.24, 1272.04)  Remember also our brothers and sisters who have fallen asleep in the hope of the Resurrection,\n(1272.04, 1275.16)  and all who have died in Your mercy.\n(1275.16, 1278.28)  Welcome them into the light of Your face.\n(1278.28, 1284.36)  Have mercy on us all, we pray, that with the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God, St. Joseph,\n(1284.36, 1289.76)  her spouse, with the Blessed Apostles, St. Brigid of Kildare, St. Augustine, and all\n(1289.76, 1295.48)  the saints who have pleased you throughout the ages, that we may merit to be co-heirs\n(1295.48, 1304.32)  to eternal life and may praise and glorify you through your Son, Jesus Christ.\n(1304.32, 1306.6)  Through Him, and with Him, and in Him.\n(1306.6, 1310.12)  Oh God, Almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\n(1310.12, 1314.28)  all glory and honor is Yours, forever and ever.\n(1317.28, 1320.48)  At the Savior's command and formed by divine teaching,\n(1320.48, 1322.48)  we dare to pray now.\n(1322.48, 1327.08)  Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.\n(1327.08, 1330.08)  Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,\n(1330.08, 1332.68)  on earth as it is in heaven.\n(1332.68, 1337.68)  to stay by daily bread, and to give us our trespasses,\n(1337.72, 1341.32)  as we forgive those who trespass against us,\n(1341.32, 1346.04)  and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.\n(1346.04, 1348.92)  Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil,\n(1348.92, 1351.2)  graciously grant peace in our days,\n(1351.2, 1353.4)  that by the help of your mercy,\n(1353.4, 1357.4)  we may be always free from sin and safe from all distress,\n(1357.4, 1358.92)  as we await the blessed hope\n(1358.92, 1361.92)  in the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ.\n(1361.92, 1365.88)  the kingdom, the power, and the glory of the Lord.\n(1365.88, 1368.54)  Lord Jesus Christ, who said to your apostles,\n(1368.54, 1371.26)  peace I leave you, my peace I give you.\n(1371.26, 1374.52)  Look not now on our sins, but on the faith of your church,\n(1374.52, 1376.92)  and graciously grant your peace and unity\n(1376.92, 1378.8)  in accordance with your will,\n(1378.8, 1381.92)  to live and reign forever and ever.\n(1381.92, 1385.48)  The peace of the Lord be with you always.\n(1385.48, 1388.6)  Let's offer each other some sign of Christ's peace.\n(1391.92, 1413.3)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1413.3, 1418.92)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1418.92, 1422.56)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world.\n(1422.56, 1424.04)  Grant us peace.\n(1430.72, 1432.84)  Behold the Lamb of God.\n(1432.84, 1436.32)  Behold him who takes away the sins of the world.\n(1436.32, 1439.76)  Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb.\n(1439.76, 1443.6)  Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof,\n(1443.6, 1446.82)  but only say the word and my soul shall be healed.\n(1628.92, 1636.4)  Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee, blessed art thou among women, and blessed\n(1636.4, 1638.84)  is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.\n(1638.84, 1645.32)  Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death.\n(1645.32, 1648.8)  Let us pray.\n(1648.8, 1653.8)  Having consumed these gifts, we pray, O Lord, that by our participation in this mystery\n(1653.8, 1659.2)  its saving effects upon us may grow through Christ our Lord.\n(1659.2, 1661.52)  The Lord be with you.\n(1661.52, 1663.52)  May Almighty God bless you, the Father.\n",

        "transcript": "(30.0, 37.0)  So, thank you very much.\n(177.0, 203.0)  So, thank you very much for joining us today, and we'll see you in the next session.\n(263.0, 281.36)  Jesus entered a village where a woman named Martha welcomed him into her home.\n(281.36, 284.92)  In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, amen.\n(284.92, 287.76)  The Lord be with you.\n(287.76, 291.8)  Today's Mass is offered for our parishioners and we celebrate the Feasts of St. Martha,\n(291.8, 296.6)  Mary, and Lazarus. My brothers and sisters, let us acknowledge our sins and so prepare\n(296.6, 305.04)  ourselves to celebrate the sacred mysteries. I confess to Almighty God and to you, my brothers\n(305.04, 311.06)  and sisters, that I have greatly sinned in my thoughts and in my words and what I have\n(311.06, 316.78)  done and what I have failed to do through my fault, through my fault, through my most\n(316.78, 323.4)  be this fault. Therefore I ask the blessed Mary ever-virgin, all the angels and saints,\n(323.4, 329.14)  and you my brothers and sisters, to pray for me to the Lord our God. May almighty God have\n(329.14, 336.82)  mercy on us, forgive us our sins, and bring us to everlasting life. Lord have mercy. Christ\n(336.82, 347.5)  have mercy. Lord have mercy. Let us pray. Grant we pray Almighty God that the\n(347.5, 353.32)  example of your saints may spur us on to a better life so that we so that we who\n(353.32, 358.18)  celebrate the memory of Saints Martha Mary and Lazarus may also imitate\n(358.18, 363.42)  without ceasing their deeds through our Lord Jesus Christ your son who lives and\n(363.42, 366.06)  and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\n(366.06, 368.38)  God, forever and ever, amen.\n(385.04, 387.48)  A reading from the book of Exodus.\n(387.48, 389.8)  The tent which was called the meeting tent,\n(389.8, 394.08)  Moses used to pitch at some distance away outside the camp.\n(394.08, 396.28)  Anyone who wished to consult the Lord\n(396.28, 399.6)  would go to this meeting tent outside the camp.\n(399.6, 401.84)  Whenever Moses went out to the tent,\n(401.84, 403.32)  the people would all rise\n(403.32, 405.84)  and stand at the entrance of their own tent,\n(405.84, 408.84)  watching Moses until he entered the tent.\n(408.84, 410.56)  As Moses entered the tent,\n(410.56, 413.64)  the column of cloud would come down\n(413.64, 417.56)  and stand at its entrance while the Lord spoke to Moses.\n(417.56, 421.4)  On seeing the column of cloud stand at the entrance\n(421.4, 424.48)  of the tent, all the people would rise and worship\n(424.48, 426.96)  at the entrance of their own tents.\n(426.96, 430.72)  The Lord used to speak to Moses face to face,\n(430.72, 433.4)  as one man speaks to another.\n(433.4, 436.16)  Moses would then return to the camp,\n(436.16, 439.44)  but his young assistant Joshua, son of Nun,\n(439.44, 442.06)  would not move out of the tent.\n(442.06, 445.36)  Moses stood there with the Lord and proclaimed his name,\n(445.36, 451.0)  Thus the Lord passed before\n(475.06, 451.0) \n(457.34, 460.18)  a merciful and gracious God,\n(463.18, 467.18)  slow to anger, enriching kindness and fidelity, continuing his kindness for a thousand generations,\n(467.18, 470.18)  and forgiving wickedness and crime and sin,\n(470.18, 474.18)  yet not declaring the guilty guiltless,\n(474.18, 476.18)  but punishing children and grandchildren\n(476.18, 478.18)  to the third and fourth generation\n(478.18, 480.18)  of their father's wickedness.\n(480.18, 486.34)  Lord, do come along in our company, this is indeed a stiff-necked people, yet pardon our\n(486.34, 490.46)  wickedness and sins and receive us as your own.\n(490.46, 496.9)  So Moses stayed there with the Lord for forty days and forty nights, without eating any\n(496.9, 499.52)  food or drinking any water.\n(499.52, 504.46)  He wrote down on the tablets the words of the Covenant, the Ten Commandments, the word\n(504.46, 507.46)  of the Lord.\n(507.46, 513.86)  I respond to a real psalm.\n(536.08, 513.86) \n(517.94, 542.6)  The Lord secures justice and\n(517.94, 523.18)  He has made known his ways\n(547.54, 523.18) \n(527.56, 528.56)  The Lord is kind and merciful.\n(532.56, 536.56)  Merciful and gracious is the Lord, slow to anger and abounding in kindness. He will not always chide, nor does he keep his wrath forever.\n(536.56, 539.56)  The Lord is kind and merciful.\n(539.56, 542.56)  Not according to our sins does he deal with us,\n(542.56, 546.56)  nor does he requite us according to our crimes.\n(546.56, 549.56)  For as the heavens are high above the Earth,\n(549.56, 552.56)  so surpassing is his kindness towards those who fear him.\n(552.56, 558.06)  the Lord is kind and merciful.\n(558.06, 561.06)  As far as the East is from the West, as far as he put our\n(561.06, 564.56)  transgressions from us, as a father with compassion on his\n(564.56, 568.56)  children, so the Lord has compassion on those who fear\n(568.56, 572.56)  him. The Lord is kind and merciful.\n(582.56, 591.3)  And the Lord be with you.\n(612.56, 614.04)  to do the serving.\n(614.04, 615.52)  Tell her to help me.'\n(615.52, 617.16)  The Lord said to her in reply,\n(617.16, 619.4)  Martha, Martha, you are anxious\n(619.4, 621.62)  and worried about many things.\n(621.62, 623.82)  There is need of only one thing.\n(623.82, 626.02)  Mary has chosen the better part\n(626.02, 628.2)  and it will not be taken from her.\"\n(628.2, 629.78)  The gospel of the Lord.\n(635.68, 638.52)  We see from the first reading from the book of Exodus\n(638.52, 641.76)  that worship makes us friends with God.\n(641.76, 645.18)  Moses and the people when they worship God in the tent of meeting\n(645.18, 650.52)  They're able to see him and speak to him face to face and the same is true for us today\n(650.74, 658.92)  who have the privilege of worshiping God every day and it culminates in receiving the God of the universe in his very flesh and\n(659.96, 663.46)  That's why the Catholic worship is what's called codified\n(663.46, 667.84)  It means that every single Catholic throughout the world when they go to mass\n(668.04, 667.84) \n(673.26, 677.68)  hears the same readings and hears the same prayers and the ranking of those feasts is very important and it relates to a new feast that Pope Francis created\n(677.68, 683.22)  which we celebrate today. So there's four ways that the church ranks these feasts\n(683.22, 687.82)  and they go in order of importance and the first is called a solemnity.\n(687.82, 693.54)  An example of a solemnity would be the Immaculate Conception or the\n(693.54, 697.32)  the Assumption, Christmas, big, big feasts.\n(697.32, 700.22)  And in those feasts, there's always two readings\n(700.22, 702.2)  and a Gloria and a Creed.\n(702.2, 704.58)  A Sunday would be another example of a solemnity.\n(704.58, 706.4)  And then next is a feast.\n(706.4, 709.12)  A feast would be of the apostles.\n(709.12, 713.36)  And in a feast, there's no Creed said, but there's a Gloria.\n(713.36, 715.92)  Third, there's what's called a Memorial,\n(715.92, 719.6)  which would be for basically your standard saint.\n(719.6, 722.48)  And there's no Creed and there's no Gloria said.\n(722.48, 724.6)  And then finally, there's what's called\n(724.6, 728.7)  an optional memorial for some of the more minor saints.\n(728.7, 732.2)  And the priest is not obliged to say that feast,\n(732.2, 734.68)  to say that the mass for that Saint that day.\n(734.68, 738.52)  I'm sharing all of this with you because in 2021,\n(738.52, 743.52)  Pope Francis added Saints Mary and Lazarus\n(744.84, 746.76)  to the Memorial of St. Martha,\n(746.76, 750.0)  and he elevated it to a memorial.\n(750.0, 752.3)  And that's just not an arbitrary decision\n(752.3, 753.86)  because what that does is he said,\n(753.86, 757.08)  okay, these three saints as a package\n(757.08, 760.88)  should be celebrated by Catholics all over the world\n(760.88, 764.64)  because they teach us two basic points.\n(764.64, 769.56)  The first is that sanctity begins in the home.\n(769.56, 770.56)  These were siblings.\n(770.56, 773.12)  And so Pope Francis rightly pointed out\n(773.12, 776.96)  that we learn the beginnings of love\n(776.96, 780.24)  and we learn how to give and receive love in the home,\n(780.24, 782.96)  in the context with our family and our siblings.\n(782.96, 785.24)  And so he wanted Catholics world over\n(785.24, 786.86)  to be reminded of that point.\n(786.86, 791.56)  And finally, the second one is that any holy life\n(791.56, 795.02)  is a balance between contemplation and action.\n(795.02, 796.28)  We need both.\n(796.28, 798.52)  We don't put one above the other,\n(798.52, 801.72)  but our service flows from our prayer.\n(801.72, 803.92)  And so the fact that Catholics world over\n(803.92, 807.76)  honor these three saints today should encourage us\n(807.76, 810.16)  that we should examine our lives as well\n(810.16, 812.44)  and say, okay, I want my service,\n(812.44, 815.52)  my love of neighbor to be fueled by my prayer\n(815.52, 818.92)  because we need to be both like Martha and Mary.\n(818.92, 821.28)  And so let us stand and make our petitions known\n(821.28, 822.66)  to our Heavenly Father.\n(824.2, 826.98)  We pray for Pope Leo and for Bishop Richard Henning\n(826.98, 829.24)  and for all bishops throughout the church.\n(829.24, 832.4)  May God give them the grace to be true shepherds of souls\n(832.4, 834.32)  so all can come to know the love of Christ.\n(834.32, 835.5)  We pray to the Lord.\n(837.48, 838.96)  We pray for all civil leaders,\n(838.96, 841.3)  governments and elected officials throughout the world.\n(841.3, 843.98)  May they enact policies that protect the church\n(843.98, 845.74)  and give her the freedom to be herself\n(845.74, 847.48)  so the kingdom of God can be spread\n(847.48, 849.1)  to every corner of the globe.\n(849.1, 850.28)  We pray to the Lord.\n(851.78, 854.38)  We pray for an increase of vocations to the priesthood\n(854.38, 856.86)  and to the religious life, especially from members\n(856.86, 859.5)  from our own parishes and our own families.\n(859.5, 862.62)  May the intercession of saints, Martha and Mary and Lazarus\n(862.62, 866.02)  call many men and women to give their lives entirely to God.\n(866.02, 867.26)  We pray to the Lord.\n(868.96, 873.44)  and we pray for our parishioners for whom this mass is offered. We pray to the Lord.\n(875.04, 879.76)  Heavenly Father, we make these prayers with great confidence as we ask them to the intercessions\n(879.76, 884.32)  of Saints Martha, Mary, and Lazarus, and Our Lady, our Morning Star and Gate of Heaven,\n(884.32, 895.6)  and we speak them in the name of Jesus, her Son, who is Lord forever and ever. Amen.\n(958.96, 985.18)  Pray, brothers and sisters, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God, the Almighty\n(985.18, 986.18)  Father.\n(986.18, 989.18)  of Christ, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,\n(989.18, 991.18)  for the praise and glory of his name,\n(991.18, 994.5)  for our good and the good of all his holy Church.\n(994.5, 996.26)  As we proclaim your wonders\n(996.26, 999.38)  in Saints Martha, Mary, and Lazarus, O Lord,\n(999.38, 1001.9)  we humbly implore your majesty\n(1001.9, 1005.22)  that as their homage of love was pleasing to you,\n(1005.22, 1009.98)  so too our dutiful service may find favor in your sight,\n(1009.98, 1011.66)  through Christ our Lord.\n(1013.1, 1014.58)  The Lord be with you.\n(1014.58, 1015.54)  Amen.\n(1015.54, 1020.54)  lift up your hearts, let us give thanks to the Lord our God.\n(1021.84, 1024.86)  It is truly right in just our duty and our salvation,\n(1024.86, 1026.92)  always and everywhere to give you thanks,\n(1026.92, 1029.6)  Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God.\n(1029.6, 1032.18)  For you are praised in the company of your saints,\n(1032.18, 1035.06)  and in crowning their merits, you crown your own gifts.\n(1035.06, 1037.62)  By their way of life, you offer us an example.\n(1037.62, 1040.34)  By communion with them, you give us companionship.\n(1040.34, 1042.82)  By their intercession, sure support.\n(1042.82, 1046.04)  so that encouraged by so great a cloud of witnesses,\n(1046.04, 1048.86)  we may run as victors in the race before us,\n(1048.86, 1051.5)  and win with them the imperishable crown of glory,\n(1051.5, 1053.02)  through Christ our Lord.\n(1053.02, 1055.42)  And so with the angels and archangels,\n(1055.42, 1057.5)  and with the great multitude of the saints,\n(1057.5, 1059.36)  we sing the hymn of your praise,\n(1059.36, 1061.58)  as without end we acclaim.\n(1061.58, 1063.86)  Holy, holy, holy,\n(1063.86, 1065.74)  Lord God of hosts,\n(1065.74, 1068.46)  heaven and earth are full of your glory,\n(1068.46, 1070.42)  O Zana in the highest.\n(1070.42, 1073.62)  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.\n(1073.62, 1075.5)  Hosanna in the highest.\n(1078.18, 1080.02)  You are indeed holy, O Lord,\n(1080.02, 1082.38)  and all you have created rightly gives you praise.\n(1082.38, 1085.06)  For through your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ,\n(1085.06, 1087.38)  by the power and working of the Holy Spirit,\n(1087.38, 1090.02)  you give life to all things and make them holy,\n(1090.02, 1092.72)  and you never cease to gather a people to yourself,\n(1092.72, 1095.34)  so that from the rising of the sun to its setting,\n(1095.34, 1098.62)  a pure sacrifice may be offered to your name.\n(1098.62, 1101.26)  Therefore, O Lord, we humbly implore you,\n(1101.26, 1104.04)  by the same Spirit graciously make holy these gifts\n(1104.04, 1106.24)  we have brought to you for consecration,\n(1106.24, 1108.98)  that they may become the body and blood\n(1108.98, 1111.66)  of your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ,\n(1111.66, 1114.62)  at whose command we celebrate these mysteries.\n(1114.62, 1117.1)  For on the night he was betrayed,\n(1117.1, 1120.1)  he himself took bread, and giving you thanks,\n(1120.1, 1122.62)  he said the blessing, broke the bread,\n(1122.62, 1125.1)  and gave it to his disciples, saying,\n(1126.22, 1125.1) \n(1135.38, 1150.94)  Take this, all of you, and eat of it, for this is my body, which will be given up for you.\n(1150.94, 1156.82)  In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took the chalice, and giving you thanks he\n(1156.82, 1161.74)  said the blessing, and gave the chalice to his disciples, saying,\n(1161.74, 1170.66)  Take this, all of you, and drink from it, for this is the chalice of my blood, the blood\n(1170.66, 1175.28)  of the new and eternal covenant, which will be poured out for you and for many for the\n(1175.28, 1177.6)  forgiveness of sins.\n(1177.6, 1194.96)  Do this in memory of me.\n(1194.96, 1201.44)  The mystery of faith, save us, Savior of the world, for by your cross and resurrection\n(1201.44, 1202.8)  you have set us free.\n(1202.8, 1208.24)  Therefore, O Lord, as we celebrate the memorial of the saving passion of your son, his wondrous\n(1208.24, 1212.8)  resurrection and ascension into heaven, and as we look forward to his second coming, we\n(1212.8, 1215.56)  offer you in thanksgiving this holy and living sacrifice.\n(1215.56, 1220.74)  Look, we pray, upon the oblation of your Church, and recognizing the sacrificial victim by\n(1220.74, 1225.38)  whose death you willed to reconcile us to yourself, grant that we who are nourished\n(1225.38, 1230.3)  by the Body and Blood of your Son, and filled with his Holy Spirit, may become one Body,\n(1230.3, 1231.82)  one Spirit in Christ.\n(1231.82, 1236.04)  May he make of us an eternal offering to you, so that we may obtain an inheritance with\n(1236.04, 1241.2)  your elect, especially with the most blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God, with blessed Joseph\n(1241.2, 1246.36)  her spouse, with your blessed apostles and glorious martyrs, with saints Martha, Mary,\n(1246.36, 1251.16)  and Lazarus, and with all the saints, under whose constant intercession in your presence\n(1251.16, 1253.34)  we rely for unfailing help.\n(1253.34, 1258.46)  May this sacrifice of our reconciliation, we pray, O Lord, advance the peace and salvation\n(1258.46, 1259.68)  of all the world.\n(1259.68, 1263.34)  pleased to confirm in faith and charity your pilgrim

scattered throughout the\n(1281.14, 1285.22)  world to our departed brothers and sisters and to all who are pleasing to\n(1285.22, 1289.44)  you at their passing from this life give kind admittance to your kingdom there we\n(1289.44, 1292.8)  hope to enjoy forever the fullness of your glory, through Christ our Lord,\n(1292.8, 1301.56)  through whom you bestow on the world all that is good. Through him and with him\n(1301.56, 1306.92)  and in him, O God Almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, all glory and\n(1306.92, 1315.48)  honor is yours forever and ever.

        "transcript": "(240.0, 269.96)  Good morning everyone, a hot day but a beautiful day as we celebrate the feast of St. Martha.\n(269.96, 274.8)  In the name of the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit, amen, the Lord be with you.\n(274.8, 278.44)  As we gather this morning, we ask the Lord to prepare our hearts for this sacred mystery,\n(278.44, 281.2)  asking God for his forgiveness and love.\n(281.2, 282.2)  Lord have mercy.\n(282.2, 283.2)  Lord have mercy.\n(283.2, 284.2)  Christ have mercy.\n(284.2, 285.2)  Christ have mercy.\n(285.2, 286.2)  Lord have mercy.\n(286.2, 287.2)  Lord have mercy.\n(287.2, 291.7)  May almighty God have mercy on us, may the Lord forgive us our sins and bring us to everlasting\n(291.7, 292.7)  life.\n(292.7, 293.7)  Amen.\n(293.7, 294.7)  Let us pray.\n(294.7, 299.08)  Almighty and ever-living God, whose Son was pleased to be welcomed in St. Martha's house\n(299.08, 304.24)  as a guest, grant we pray that through her intercession, serving Christian faithfully\n(304.24, 309.68)  and our brothers and sisters, we may merit to be received by you in the halls of heaven,\n(309.68, 316.68)  and we ask this through Christ our Lord. Amen. Let us now be attentive to God's sacred word.\n(325.16, 316.68) \n(327.9, 335.52)  A reading from the book of Exodus. The tent, which was called the meeting tent, Moses used to pitch at some distance away\n(335.52, 338.38)  outside the camp.\n(338.38, 345.22)  Anyone who wished to consult the Lord would go to this meeting tent outside the camp.\n(345.22, 351.8)  Whenever Moses went out to the tent, the people would all rise and stand at the entrance of\n(351.8, 358.1)  their own tents, watching Moses until he entered the tent.\n(358.1, 365.48)  As Moses entered the tent, the column of cloud would come down and stand at its entrance\n(365.48, 369.32)  while the Lord spoke with Moses.\n(369.32, 374.72)  On seeing the column of cloud stand at the entrance of the tent, all the people would\n(374.72, 380.08)  rise and worship at the entrance of their own tents.\n(380.08, 387.26)  The Lord used to speak to Moses face to face, as one man speaks to another.\n(387.26, 393.98)  Moses would then return to the camp, but his young assistant Joshua, son of Nun, would\n(393.98, 397.86)  not move out of the tent.\n(397.86, 403.3)  Moses stood there with the Lord and proclaimed his name, Lord.\n(403.3, 407.34)  Thus the Lord passed before him and cried out.\n(407.34, 414.34)  The Lord, the Lord, a merciful and gracious God, slow to anger and rich in kindness and\n(414.34, 422.28)  fidelity, continuing his kindness for a thousand generations, and forgiving wickedness and\n(422.28, 431.06)  crime and sin, yet not declaring the guilty guiltless, but punishing children and grandchildren\n(431.06, 438.06)  to the third and fourth generation for their father's wickedness.\n(438.06, 441.94)  Moses at once bowed down to the ground in worship.\n(441.94, 449.06)  Then he said, If I find favor with you, O Lord, do come along in our company.\n(449.06, 456.18)  This is, indeed, a stiff-necked people, yet pardon our wickedness and sins, and receive\n(456.18, 459.78)  us as your own.\n(459.78, 466.36)  So Moses stayed there with the Lord for forty days and forty nights, without eating any\n(466.36, 469.56)  food or drinking any water.\n(469.56, 476.28)  And he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the Ten Commandments.\n(476.28, 480.4)  The word of the Lord.\n(480.4, 485.4)  The Lord is kind and merciful.\n(485.4, 489.72)  The Lord secures justice and the rights of all the oppressed.\n(489.72, 498.36)  He has made known his ways to Moses and his deeds to the children of Israel.\n(498.36, 504.24)  Merciful and gracious is the Lord, slow to anger and abounding in kindness.\n(504.24, 512.4)  He will not always chide, nor does he keep his wrath forever.\n(512.4, 518.72)  Not according to our sins does he deal with us, nor does he requite us according to our\n(518.72, 526.0)  crimes, for as the heavens are high above the earth, so surpassing is his kindness towards\n(526.0, 530.38)  those who fear him.\n(530.38, 537.52)  As far as the east is from the west, so far has he put our transgressions from us.\n(537.52, 543.52)  As a father has compassion on his children, so the Lord has compassion on those who fear\n(543.52, 566.92)  The Lord is highly merciful.\n(566.92, 568.4)  The Lord be with you.\n(568.4, 571.72)  A reading from the Holy Gospel according to John.\n(573.56, 576.6)  Many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary\n(576.6, 580.28)  and comfort them after their brother Lazarus who had died.\n(580.28, 582.56)  When Martha heard that Jesus was coming,\n(582.56, 586.08)  she went to meet him, but Mary sat at home.\n(586.08, 588.88)  Martha said to Jesus, Lord, if you had been here,\n(588.88, 591.24)  my brother would never have died.\n(591.24, 594.4)  But even now I know that whatever you ask of God,\n(594.4, 596.08)  God will give you.\n(596.08, 600.34)  Jesus said to her, your brother will rise, Martha.\n(600.34, 602.7)  Said to him, I know he will.\n(602.7, 605.66)  In the resurrection on the last day,\n(605.66, 610.26)  Jesus told her, I am the resurrection and the life.\n(610.26, 613.42)  Whoever believes in me, even if he dies, will live.\n(613.42, 617.62)  And anyone who lives and believes in me will never die.\n(617.62, 619.1)  Do you believe this?\n(619.1, 621.02)  She said to him, yes, Lord.\n(621.02, 625.9)  I have come to believe that you are Christ, the Son of God.\n(625.9, 628.86)  the one who is coming into the world.\n(628.86, 630.46)  The gospel of the Lord.\n(630.46, 633.58)  Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ.\n(633.58, 636.82)  Beautiful reading that's often used many times at funerals.\n(636.82, 638.9)  It's about resurrection and new life.\n(638.9, 640.98)  And Martha, the person of action,\n(640.98, 644.52)  notice Mary is contemplating in the other room,\n(644.52, 648.4)  but Jesus invites her, as a woman of the church,\n(648.4, 653.38)  to be a person he opens his heart to about the resurrection.\n(653.38, 655.08)  It's the beginning of trust.\n(655.08, 657.54)  She really doesn't know what resurrection is yet.\n(657.54, 660.32)  Even the disciples were learning what it might mean.\n(660.32, 663.1)  But Jesus is introducing the gift of death,\n(663.1, 665.18)  that from death new life comes.\n(665.18, 668.1)  So on this warm day, the homily is very short\n(668.1, 671.66)  because the whole idea is God's resurrection.\n(671.66, 674.16)  The gift of God's love comes to us\n(674.16, 676.9)  through the gift of God's grace and eternal life.\n(676.9, 680.7)  And so Jesus is introducing to Martha,\n(680.7, 683.46)  and Martha is trusting him to ask\n(683.46, 685.4)  about the questions to come.\n(685.4, 686.62)  So we ask the Lord today,\n(686.62, 688.56)  thank you for the gift of new life.\n(688.56, 691.68)  Think of those that have been resurrected, family members,\n(691.68, 694.32)  and think of our own hearts growing each day\n(694.32, 698.0)  in God's grace, trusting in the love that Martha had\n(698.0, 699.52)  for Jesus today.\n(699.52, 702.72)  For this, I will stand now for our prayer of the faithful.\n(702.72, 704.8)  Loving God, as we come before you this day,\n(704.8, 706.84)  we pray for the gift of resurrection.\n(706.84, 709.66)  All those we pray over Christ, we pray to the Lord.\n(710.76, 712.44)  We pray for all those here.\n(712.44, 715.68)  may God guide our efforts to share the gospel message\n(715.68, 717.8)  with others, we pray to the Lord.\n(718.8, 720.88)  For all the souls of the faithful departed,\n(720.88, 723.8)  may God grant them eternal life in heaven,\n(723.8, 725.12)  we pray to the Lord.\n(726.4, 728.56)  Father, from whom all goodness comes,\n(728.56, 729.96)  hear our prayers this morning\n(729.96, 732.12)  and answer them according to your will,\n(732.12, 735.26)  and we ask this through Christ our Lord, amen.\n(735.26, 736.1)  Let us celebrate.\n(749.44, 768.44)  Thank you so much.\n(768.44, 790.44)  Pray, my brothers and sisters, that a sacrifice may be acceptable to God the Almighty Father.\n(790.44, 795.44)  May the Lord accept this sacrifice in your name, for the praise and glory of His name,\n(795.44, 804.32)  As we proclaim Your wonders in St. Martha, O Lord, we humbly implore Your Majesty that\n(804.32, 810.2)  her homage of love was pleasing to You, so too our dutiful service may find favor in\n(810.2, 815.08)  Your sight through Christ our Lord.\n(815.08, 817.76)  My friends, the Lord be with you.\n(817.76, 819.76)  Lift up your hearts.\n(819.76, 823.4)  Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.\n(823.4, 825.92)  is truly right in just our duty and our salvation,\n(825.92, 827.96)  always and everywhere to give you thanks.\n(827.96, 830.24)  For in the marvelous confession of the saints,\n(830.24, 832.56)  you make your church fruitful and strengthen us\n(832.56, 834.52)  by the offer of signs of love,\n(834.52, 837.04)  that your saving mysteries may be fulfilled\n(837.04, 839.36)  in a great example to lead us in courage,\n(839.36, 842.2)  that our fervent prayers sustain us in all we do.\n(842.2, 844.56)  And so the Lord with all the angels and saints,\n(844.56, 848.44)  we too give you thanks as an exaltation we acclaim.\n(848.44, 852.32)  Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts,\n(852.32, 856.32)  Heaven and earth are full of your glory, Hosanna in the highest.\n(856.32, 861.32)  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, Hosanna in the highest.\n(861.32, 864.32)  You are indeed holy, O Lord, the fount of all holiness.\n(864.32, 869.32)  Make holy these gifts, we pray, by sending down your Spirit upon them like the default,\n(869.32, 875.32)  that they may become for us the body and blood of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.\n(875.32, 879.32)  At the time you was betrayed and entered willingly into his passion,\n(879.32, 883.32)  He took bread and, giving thanks, broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying,\n(883.32, 888.32)  Take this, all of you, and eat of it, for this is my body, which will be given up for you.\n(895.32, 898.32)  In a similar way, when Sepul was entered, he took the chalice.\n(898.32, 901.32)  Once more giving thanks, he gave it to his disciples, saying,\n(901.32, 905.32)  Take this, all of you, and drink from it, for this is a chalice of my blood,\n(905.32, 912.32)  the blood of the new and eternal covenant which will be poured out for you and for many for the givest of sins.\n(912.32, 914.32)  Do this in memory of me.\n(922.32, 930.32)  The mystery of faith. When we eat this bread and drink this cup, we proclaim your death, O Lord, until you come again.\n(930.32, 934.32)  Therefore, as we celebrate the memorial of his death and resurrection,\n(934.32, 938.72)  We offer you, Lord, the bread of life and the chalice of salvation, giving thanks that\n(938.72, 943.24)  you have held us worthy to be in your presence and minister to you.\n(943.24, 948.36)  Humbly we pray that partaking of the body and blood of Christ we may be gathered into\n(948.36, 949.96)  one by the Holy Spirit.\n(949.96, 954.02)  Remember, Lord, your Church, spread throughout the world.\n(954.02, 958.44)  Give her the fullness of charity, together with Leo our Pope, Richard our Bishop, and\n(958.44, 959.44)  all the clergy.\n(959.44, 965.72)  Today, O Lord, we pray for Buddy and Kristen, O Lord this day, whom you call from this world\n(965.72, 966.72)  to yourself.\n(966.72, 972.08)  Grant that they who were united with your Son in a death like His may also be one with\n(972.08, 974.24)  Him in His resurrection.\n(974.24, 979.2)  Remember also our brothers and sisters who have fallen asleep in the hope of the resurrection\n(979.2, 981.92)  and all who have died in your mercy.\n(981.92, 984.04)  Welcome them into the light of your face.\n(984.04, 989.4)  Have mercy on us all, we pray, with the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God, St. Moth of this\n(989.4, 994.4)  and all the apostles and all the saints who have pleased you throughout the ages,\n(994.4, 1002.4)  that we may merit to be coheirs to eternal life, and praise and glorify you through your Son Jesus Christ.\n(1002.4, 1008.4)  For it is through him, with him, oh God Almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\n(1008.4, 1013.4)  all glory and honor is yours forever and ever. Amen.\n(1015.4, 1013.4) \n(1023.4, 1028.4)  At the Savior's command and formed by divine teaching, we dare to say our Father who art in heaven and will be with thine aid. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.\n(1028.4, 1036.4)  Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us,\n(1036.4, 1040.4)  and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.\n(1040.4, 1047.08)  Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil. Graciously grant peace in our days, that by\n(1047.08, 1053.8)  the help of your mercy we may be always free from sin, safe from our distress, as we await\n(1053.8, 1059.92)  the blessed hope and the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ. For the kingdom, the power and\n(1059.92, 1062.52)  the glory are yours, now and forever.\n(1062.52, 1067.76)  Lord Jesus, you say to your apostles, Peace I leave you, and I peace I give you. Look\n(1067.76, 1072.76)  not on our sins, but on the faith of your Church, and graciously grant her peace and\n(1072.76, 1077.92)  unity in accordance with your will, who live and reign forever and ever.\n(1077.92, 1082.32)  On this beautiful day, may the peace of the Lord be with you always.\n(1082.32, 1092.92)  Let us offer each other a sign of peace.\n(1092.92, 1097.24)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1097.24, 1101.24)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1101.24, 1106.24)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, grant us peace.\n(1106.24, 1110.24)  Behold the Lamb of God, behold Him who takes away the sins of the world.\n(1110.24, 1113.24)  Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb.\n(1113.24, 1115.24)  Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof,\n(1115.24, 1118.24)  but only say the word and my soul shall be healed.\n(1118.24, 1121.24)  May the body and blood of Christ keep us safe for eternal life.\n(1127.24, 1134.24)  the house of the lord of my days.\n(1157.24, 1178.72)  Lord, one day with him the hearts have known Heals every day alone, O Lord, bring me to\n(1178.72, 1184.72)  Lord, I pray that you will be with me, Lord, I pray that you will be with me, Lord, I pray that you will be with me, Lord, I pray that you will be with me, Lord, I pray that you will be with me, Lord, I pray that you will be with me, Lord, I pray that you will be with me, Lord, I pray that you will be with me, Lord, I pray that you will be with me, Lord, I pray that you will be with me, Lord, I pray that you will be with me, Lord, I pray that you will be with me, Lord, I pray that you will be with me, Lord, I pray that you will be with me, Lord, I pray that you will be with me, Lord, I pray that you will be with me, Lord, I pray that you will be with me, Lord, I pray that you will be with me, Lord, I pray that you will be with me, Lord, I pray that you will be with me, Lord, I pray that you will be with me, Lord, I pray that you will be with me, Lord, I pray that you will be with me, Lord, I pray that you will be with me, Lord, I pray that you will be with me, Lord, I pray that you will be with me, Lord, I pray that you will be with me, Lord, I pray that you will be with me, Lord, I pray that you will be with me, Lord, I pray that you will be with me, Lord, I pray that you will be with me, Lord, I pray that you will be with me, Lord, I pray that you will be with me, Lord, I pray that you will be with me, Lord, I pray that you will be with me, Lord, I pray that you will be with me, Lord, I pray that you will be with me, Lord, I pray that you will be with me, Lord, Lord, I pray that you will be with me, Lord, Lord, I pray that you will be with me, Lord, And show me your way.\n(1190.72, 1196.72)  And clean my eyes,\n(1196.72, 1202.72)  is alone I see.\n(1202.72, 1207.72)  To dwell in the house of the Lord,\n(1207.72, 1221.2)  Come, my days, for one day within the temple\n(1221.2, 1227.18)  heals every day alone.\n(1227.18, 1237.18)  O Lord, bring me to your town.\n(1247.18, 1237.18) \n(1266.18, 1271.18)  The Lord is my life, and hope of salvation The Lord is my refuge, and truth is my life Whom should I be?\n(1276.18, 1281.18)  And in my heart\n(1282.18, 1287.18)  Is the Lord I seek\n(1288.18, 1292.18)  To dwell in the house of the Lord\n(1293.18, 1292.18) \n(1316.18, 1344.74)  For one day within your temple Heals every day our Lord, O Lord. Let us\n(1344.74, 1348.82)  say a special prayer for all those that may be thought of today for the gift of\n(1348.82, 1354.16)  resurrection that Martha was so open to receiving. Let us pray for those that we\n(1354.16, 1358.0)  thought about this morning. We pray for our attention already. Let us pray for\n(1358.0, 1362.72)  others in our hearts that we think of this morning. Hail Mary, full of grace, the\n(1362.72, 1367.96)  Lord is with you. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed are the fruit of thy womb, Jesus,\n(1367.96, 1373.88)  Holy Mary, Mother of God. Pray for our sins, now at the hour of our death. Amen.\n(1373.88, 1375.2)  let us pray.\n(1377.28, 1379.92)  May the holy reception of the body and blood\n(1379.92, 1382.04)  of your only begotten son, God,\n(1382.04, 1385.0)  turn us away from the cares of this fallen world\n(1385.0, 1388.36)  so that we may grow in sincere love for you on earth\n(1388.36, 1391.76)  and rejoice to behold your eternity in heaven\n(1391.76, 1393.8)  through Christ our Lord.\n(1393.8, 1394.68)  In the prayer of the faithful,\n(1394.68, 1396.92)  I meant to also mention what's happening in Gaza\n(1396.92, 1400.08)  and when you see that sadness of those starving,\n(1400.08, 1403.56)  as they say, you can't hide starvation.\n(1403.56, 1405.6)  Our eyes see the truth.\n(1405.6, 1407.36)  So the truth is they need our prayers.\n(1407.36, 1411.72)  But I like that line, you cannot hide starvation.\n(1411.72, 1414.52)  Our eyes always see the truth.\n(1414.52, 1416.88)  So for the world leaders, may they see the truth\n(1416.88, 1419.88)  and the desire for those that are in need in Gaza.\n(1419.88, 1422.92)  As we say again, heal Mary, full of grace.\n(1422.92, 1424.32)  The Lord is with thee.\n(1424.32, 1426.0)  Blessed art thou among women,\n(1426.0, 1428.16)  and blessed are the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.\n(1428.16, 1431.04)  Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for our sinners,\n(1431.04, 1433.28)  now at the hour of our death, amen.\n(1433.28, 1435.7)  Let us bow our heads and pray for God's blessings.\n(1435.7, 1437.16)  May the Lord bless you and keep you.\n(1437.16, 1440.24)  May his face shine upon you and be gracious to you.\n(1440.24, 1442.64)  Bless you in the name of the Father, the Son,\n(1442.64, 1444.48)  and the Holy Spirit, amen.\n(1444.48, 1445.72)  Our celebration has ended.\n(1445.72, 1447.64)  Let us go in the peace of Christ.\n(1447.64, 1449.18)  Thanks be to God.\n(1449.18, 1451.16)  As those who are physicians and nurses,\n(1451.16, 1453.86)  they'll say, drink lots of water.\n(1453.86, 1456.28)  So may you do that in these hot days.\n(1456.28, 1458.68)  I'll see you Thursday and Friday as well this week.\n(1458.68, 1460.12)  So I look forward to seeing you.\n(1460.12, 1461.4)  Have a safe day.\n(1461.4, 1462.24)  Go.\n",

for our God in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit\n(277.68, 283.44)  the Lord be with you today's mass is offered for our parishioners and we\n(283.44, 287.6)  celebrate a votive mass of the most precious blood of Jesus my brothers and\n(287.6, 291.36)  sisters let us acknowledge our sins and so prepare ourselves to celebrate the\n(291.36, 298.4)  sacred mysteries I confess to Almighty God and to you my brothers and sisters\n(298.4, 303.96)  sisters that I have greatly sinned in my thoughts and in my words and what I have\n(303.96, 308.04)  done and what I have failed to do through my fault through my fault\n(308.04, 312.78)  through my most grievous fault therefore I ask the Blessed Mary ever\n(312.78, 318.84)  virgin all the angels and saints and you my brothers and sisters to pray for me\n(318.84, 323.56)  to the Lord our God may Almighty God have mercy on us forgive us our sins and\n(323.56, 326.0)  bring us to everlasting life.\n(326.0, 327.28)  Lord, have mercy.\n(328.4, 329.64)  Christ, have mercy.\n(330.82, 332.0)  Lord, have mercy.\n(333.36, 334.32)  Let us pray.\n(336.68, 340.68)  Oh God, who by the precious blood of your only begotten Son\n(340.68, 342.5)  have redeemed the whole world,\n(342.5, 344.96)  preserve in us the work of your mercy,\n(344.96, 347.96)  so that ever honoring the mystery of our salvation,\n(347.96, 350.2)  we may merit to obtain its fruits\n(350.2, 352.64)  through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\n(352.64, 355.6)  who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\n(355.6, 357.12)  God forever and ever.\n(372.96, 375.48)  A reading from the book of Exodus.\n(375.48, 377.72)  Moses turned and came down the mountain\n(377.72, 381.32)  with the two tablets of the commandments in his hands.\n(381.32, 385.04)  tablets that were written on both sides, front and back,\n(385.04, 387.2)  tablets that were made by God,\n(387.2, 391.72)  having inscriptions on them that were engraved by God himself.\n(391.72, 396.36)  Now when Joshua heard the noise of the people shouting, he said to Moses,\n(396.36, 398.52)  that sounds like a battle in the camp.\n(398.52, 400.28)  But Moses answered,\n(400.28, 403.0)  it does not sound like cries of victory,\n(403.0, 406.56)  nor does it sound like cries of defeat.\n(406.56, 410.06)  The sounds that I hear are cries of revelry.\n(410.06, 413.92)  As he drew near the camp, he saw the calf and the dancing.\n(413.92, 416.22)  With that, Moses' wrath flared up\n(416.22, 417.98)  so that he threw the tablets down\n(417.98, 420.78)  and broke them on the base of the mountain.\n(420.78, 424.7)  Taking the calf they had made, he fused it in the fire,\n(424.7, 426.58)  then ground it down to powder,\n(426.58, 428.82)  which he scattered on the water\n(428.82, 430.88)  and made the children of Israel drink.\n(431.86, 435.54)  Moses asked Aaron, what did this people ever do to you\n(435.54, 439.38)  that you should lead them into so grave a sin?\n(439.38, 442.62)  Aaron replied, let not my Lord be angry.\n(442.62, 446.2)  You know well enough how prone the people are to evil.\n(446.2, 449.86)  They said to me, make us a God to be our leader.\n(449.86, 452.38)  As for the man, Moses, who brought us out\n(452.38, 454.14)  of the land of Egypt, we do not know\n(454.14, 456.1)  what has happened to him.\n(456.1, 461.04)  So I told them, let anyone who has gold jewelry take it off.\n(461.04, 463.44)  They gave it to me and I threw it into the fire\n(463.44, 464.94)  and this calf came out.\n(465.78, 468.74)  On the next day, Moses said to the people,\n(468.74, 471.1)  You have committed a grave sin.\n(471.1, 473.2)  I will go up to the Lord then.\n(473.2, 477.1)  Perhaps I may be able to make atonement for your sin.\n(477.1, 480.26)  So Moses went back to the Lord and said,\n(480.26, 482.54)  this people has indeed committed a grave sin\n(482.54, 485.8)  in making a God of gold for themselves.\n(485.8, 488.54)  If you would only forgive their sin.\n(488.54, 490.98)  If you will not, then strike me out of the book\n(490.98, 492.78)  that you have written.\n(492.78, 495.92)  The Lord answered, him only who has sinned against me\n(495.92, 498.26)  will I strike out of my book.\n(498.26, 502.36)  Now, go and lead the people to the place I have told you.\n(502.36, 504.96)  My angel will go before you.\n(504.96, 506.96)  When it is time for me to punish,\n(506.96, 509.16)  I will punish them for their sin.\n(509.16, 510.7)  This is the word of the Lord.\n(512.4, 517.0)  Responsorial Psalm, give thanks to the Lord for he is good.\n(520.24, 522.62)  Our fathers made a calf in Horeb\n(522.62, 525.52)  and adored a molten image.\n(525.52, 527.84)  They exchanged their glory for the image\n(527.84, 529.54)  of a grass-eating bullock.\n(533.36, 535.6)  They forgot the God who had saved them,\n(535.6, 537.76)  who had done great deeds in Egypt,\n(537.76, 540.36)  wondrous deeds in the land of Ham,\n(540.36, 542.38)  terrible things at the Red Sea.\n(545.96, 548.12)  Then he spoke of exterminating them,\n(548.12, 550.0)  but Moses, his chosen one,\n(550.0, 551.2)  was stood him in the breach\n(551.2, 554.32)  to turn back his destructive wrath.\n(555.52, 573.2)  Thanks be to God.\n(573.2, 575.52)  The Lord be with you.\n(575.52, 581.2)  A reading from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew.\n(581.2, 584.16)  Jesus proposed a parable to the crowds.\n(584.16, 589.32)  The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that a person took and sowed in a field.\n(589.32, 594.88)  It is the smallest of all the seeds, yet when full-grown it is the largest of plants.\n(594.88, 599.8)  It becomes a large bush, and the birds of the sky come and dwell in its branches.\n(599.8, 601.62)  He spoke to them another parable.\n(601.62, 606.26)  The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed with three measures of\n(606.26, 609.96)  wheat flour, until the whole batch was leavened.\n(609.96, 613.72)  All these things Jesus spoke to the crowds in parables.\n(613.72, 617.84)  He spoke to them only in parables to fulfill what had been said through the prophet.\n(617.84, 620.28)  I will open my mouth in parables.\n(620.28, 625.32)  I will announce what lay hidden from the foundation of the world.\n(625.32, 632.4)  The Gospel of the Lord.\n(632.4, 637.96)  Jesus uses the parables to teach us about the kingdom of God and how we are to act in\n(637.96, 640.28)  it and how we are to build it up.\n(640.28, 645.3)  And so just three very simple but helpful observations about the parables today.\n(645.3, 652.22)  The first is that we see that he compares the kingdom of God to yeast, which makes the\n(652.22, 653.74)  bread rise.\n(653.74, 659.64)  The first observation is that the flour, which has the potency to be something very good\n(659.64, 663.8)  and beautiful, is nothing without the yeast.\n(663.8, 672.92)  simple lesson, the world around us is good and beautiful, but it remains with a\n(672.92, 680.04)  lot to be desired without the yeast. If we do not respond, the kingdom of God ends\n(680.04, 685.64)  up poorer, your life is not significant. We either raise up our brothers and\n(685.64, 690.88)  sisters, we either raise up the world and bring it back to Christ, or we\n(690.88, 696.32)  bring it backwards. If we're not moving forwards, we're actually moving back. That's the first\n(696.32, 703.44)  observation. The second is the kingdom of God always starts small. This should give us a bold\n(703.44, 711.68)  confidence because the flour vastly outnumbers the yeast, but just a small little bit of yeast\n(711.68, 717.52)  makes the whole thing rise. In your workplaces, in your families, in your social circles,\n(717.52, 723.76)  even if you're outnumbered, we have to get in there because those people, if they are to come\n(723.76, 731.76)  into the kingdom of God, are counting on you. And finally, the yeast, the bread, the flour only\n(731.76, 738.72)  rises if the yeast is sort of beaten into every little bit and every corner of the flour. And so,\n(738.72, 745.84)  if we are to re-evangelize the world, we have to get our hands dirty. We have to really get\n(745.84, 750.28)  involved in people's lives and we have to be able to blend in with the world.\n(750.28, 755.88)  We're very much in the world but we're not of the world and I think this is why\n(755.88, 762.16)  the kingdom of God has waned in years because faithful people sometimes have\n(762.16, 768.2)  this trepidation or this fear to get involved but really in reality the Lord\n(768.2, 773.8)  does most of the work. The bread begins to rise in a hidden way and that's very\n(773.8, 779.08)  much how the grace of God and the Holy Spirit works in our lives. Even though the kingdom\n(779.08, 786.0)  of God starts small, when it grows, it's undeniable. That's why Jesus uses the mustard seed, because\n(786.0, 791.24)  when it grows, it's the most fine, biggest plant in everything. All the birds of the\n(791.24, 796.68)  air take refuge under it. Our brothers and sisters are longing to take refuge and find\n(796.68, 801.68)  meaning in the world and be members of the kingdom of God. Will we be the yeast? Will\n(801.68, 803.1)  Will it start small?\n(803.1, 806.22)  Will we get our hands dirty and make it rise for the Lord?\n(806.22, 808.58)  And so let us stand and make our petitions\n(808.58, 810.16)  known to our Heavenly Father.\n(812.02, 814.62)  We pray for Pope Leo and for Bishop Richard Henning\n(814.62, 816.42)  and for all bishops throughout the church.\n(816.42, 818.7)  May God give them the grace to be strong\n(818.7, 820.56)  and loving shepherds of souls\n(820.56, 822.46)  so all can come to know the love of Christ.\n(822.46, 823.6)  We pray to the Lord.\n(825.02, 826.9)  Pray for all civil leaders, governments,\n(826.9, 828.96)  and elected officials throughout the world.\n(828.96, 831.3)  May they enact policies that protect the church\n(831.3, 833.38)  and give her the freedom to be herself\n(833.38, 835.02)  so the kingdom of God can be spread\n(835.02, 837.58)  to every corner of the globe, we pray to the Lord.\n(839.34, 841.46)  We pray for an increase of vocations\n(841.46, 843.76)  to the priesthood and to the religious life,\n(843.76, 846.0)  especially for members from our own parishes\n(846.0, 848.56)  and our own families, we pray to the Lord.\n(849.62, 851.3)  And we pray for our parishioners\n(851.3, 853.94)  for whom this mass is offered, we pray to the Lord.\n(855.14, 858.1)  Heavenly Father, we make these prayers with great confidence\n(858.1, 860.38)  as we ask them through the intercession of Mary,\n(860.38, 863.72)  queen of the rosary and gate of heaven and we speak them in the name of Jesus\n(863.72, 868.02)  her son who is Lord forever and ever.\n(890.38, 897.38)  So, thank you very much for joining us today, and we'll see you in the next session.\n(950.38, 961.06)  Pray, brothers and sisters, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God the Almighty\n(961.06, 969.86)  Father.\n(969.86, 975.54)  As we offer our oblation to your majesty, O Lord, may we draw near in these mysteries\n(975.54, 978.7)  to Jesus, the mediator of the new covenant,\n(978.7, 981.54)  and celebrate anew the sprinkling of his blood,\n(981.54, 986.5)  in which lies all our salvation, through Christ our Lord.\n(986.5, 988.94)  The Lord be with you.\n(988.94, 991.3)  Lift up your hearts.\n(991.3, 995.3)  Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.\n(995.3, 998.24)  It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,\n(998.24, 1001.54)  always and everywhere to give you thanks, Lord Holy Father,\n(1001.54, 1003.38)  Almighty and eternal God.\n(1003.38, 1005.82)  For through the saving passion of your Son,\n(1005.82, 1007.66)  the whole world has received a heart\n(1007.66, 1010.62)  to confess the infinite power of your majesty,\n(1010.62, 1013.22)  since by the wondrous power of the cross,\n(1013.22, 1015.42)  your judgment on the world is now revealed\n(1015.42, 1017.74)  and the authority of Christ crucified.\n(1017.74, 1020.9)  And so, Lord, with all the angels and saints,\n(1020.9, 1024.38)  we too give you thanks as an exaltation we acclaim.\n(1024.38, 1028.56)  Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts,\n(1028.56, 1031.18)  heaven and earth are full of your glory,\n(1031.18, 1033.22)  Hosanna in the highest.\n(1033.22, 1036.48)  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.\n(1036.48, 1038.2)  Hosanna in the highest.\n(1040.44, 1042.28)  You are indeed holy, O Lord,\n(1042.28, 1044.94)  and all you have created rightly gives you praise.\n(1044.94, 1047.6)  For through your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ,\n(1047.6, 1049.96)  by the power and working of the Holy Spirit,\n(1049.96, 1052.56)  you give life to all things and make them holy,\n(1052.56, 1055.24)  and you never cease to gather a people to yourself,\n(1055.24, 1057.96)  so that from the rising of the sun to its setting,\n(1057.96, 1061.38)  a pure sacrifice may be offered to your name.\n(1061.38, 1064.06)  Therefore, O Lord, we humbly implore you,\n(1064.06, 1066.94)  by the same Spirit graciously make holy these gifts\n(1066.94, 1069.06)  we have brought to you for consecration,\n(1069.06, 1071.96)  that they may become the body and blood\n(1071.96, 1074.66)  of your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ,\n(1074.66, 1077.46)  at whose command we celebrate these mysteries.\n(1077.46, 1079.74)  For in the night he was betrayed,\n(1079.74, 1082.9)  he himself took bread, and giving you thanks,\n(1082.9, 1085.42)  he said the blessing, broke the bread,\n(1085.42, 1088.96)  and gave it to his disciples, saying,\n(1088.96, 1093.16)  take this, all of you, and eat of it,\n(1093.16, 1098.16)  for this is my body, which will be given up for you.\n(1100.8, 1105.8)  In a similar way, when supper was ended,\n(1115.42, 1121.82)  he took the chalice and giving you thanks he said the blessing and gave the chalice to his disciples\n(1121.82, 1131.58)  saying take this all of you and drink from it for this is the chalice of my blood the blood of the\n(1131.58, 1137.1)  new and eternal covenant which will be poured out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins\n(1137.98, 1137.1) \n(1142.22, 1155.22)  Do this in memory of me.\n(1160.94, 1166.02)  The mystery of faith. Save us, Savior of the world, for by your cross and resurrection you have set us free. Therefore, O Lord, as we celebrate the\n(1166.02, 1169.86)  memorial of the saving passion of your Son, his wondrous resurrection and\n(1169.86, 1173.7)  ascension into heaven, and as we look forward to his second coming, we offer\n(1173.7, 1177.9)  you in thanksgiving this holy and living sacrifice. Look, we pray, upon the\n(1177.9, 1182.18)  oblation of your church and recognizing the sacrificial victim by whose death\n(1182.18, 1187.06)  you willed to reconcile us to yourself. Granted, we who are nourished by the body\n(1187.06, 1191.58)  and blood of your Son and filled with his Holy Spirit may become one body, one\n(1191.58, 1196.2)  spirit in Christ. May he make of us an eternal offering to you, so that we may\n(1196.2, 1200.12)  obtain an inheritance with your elect, especially with the most blessed Virgin\n(1200.12, 1204.86)  Mary, Mother of God, with blessed Joseph, her spouse, with your blessed apostles and\n(1204.86, 1209.08)  glorious martyrs, and with all the saints. Under his constant intercession in your\n(1209.08, 1214.64)  presence, we rely for unfailing help. May this sacrifice of our reconciliation, we\n(1214.64, 1218.96)  pray, O Lord, advance the peace and salvation of all the world. Be pleased to\n(1218.96, 1223.38)  confirm in faith and charity your pilgrim church on earth, with your servant Leo, our\n(1223.38, 1228.5)  Pope, and Richard, our Bishop, the order of bishops, all the clergy, and the entire people\n(1228.5, 1233.84)  you have gained for your own. Listen graciously to the prayers of this family, whom you have\n(1233.84, 1238.74)  summoned before you, and your compassionate, merciful Father. Gather to yourself all your\n(1238.74, 1243.14)  children scattered throughout the world, to our departed brothers and sisters, and to\n(1243.14, 1247.28)  all who are pleasing to you at their passing from this life. Give kind admittance to your\n(1247.28, 1251.08)  kingdom, there we hope to enjoy forever the fullness of your glory, through\n(1251.08, 1259.28)  Christ our Lord, through whom you bestow on the world all that is good. Through\n(1259.28, 1264.36)  him and with him and in him, O God Almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy\n(1264.36, 1273.04)  Spirit, all glory and honor is yours forever and ever. At the Savior's command,\n(1273.04, 1280.52)  informed by divine teaching we dare to say our Father who art in heaven hallowed\n(1280.52, 1287.2)  be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven give us\n(1287.2, 1293.44)  this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who\n(1293.44, 1299.12)  trespass against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil\n(1299.12, 1304.44)  deliver us Lord we pray from every evil graciously grant peace in our days that\n(1304.44, 1308.44)  by the help of your mercy we may be always free from sin and safe from all\n(1308.44, 1312.8)  distress as we await the blessed hope and the coming of our Savior Jesus\n(1312.8, 1321.28)  Christ Lord Jesus Christ who said to your apostles peace I leave you my peace\n(1321.28, 1325.56)  I give you look not in our sins but on the faith of your church and graciously\n(1325.56, 1328.8)  grant her peace and unity in accordance with your will, who live and reign\n(1328.8, 1334.56)  forever and ever. The peace of the Lord be with you always. Let us offer each\n(1334.56, 1342.36)  other the sign of peace. Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have\n(1342.36, 1348.4)  mercy on us. Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1348.4, 1354.96)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, grant us peace.\n(1355.56, 1379.1)  Behold the Lamb of God, behold him who takes away the sins of the world.\n(1379.1, 1381.54)  Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb.\n(1381.54, 1386.58)  Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof, but only say the\n(1386.58, 1390.46)  word and my soul shall be healed.\n(1411.54, 1435.38)  The\n(1435.38, 1441.46)  chalice of blessing that we bless is a communion in the blood of Christ and the bread that\n(1441.46, 1445.62)  that we break is a sharing in the body of the Lord.\n(1589.46, 1596.46)  So, thank you very much for your attention and I look forward to seeing you again soon.\n(1678.46, 1701.38)  Let us pray.\n(1701.38, 1713.38)  We pray, refreshed, O Lord, by the saving food and drink, we pray that we may always be bathed in the blood of our Savior,\n(1713.38, 1720.38)  so that it may become for us a spring of water, welling up to eternal life, through Christ our Lord.\n(1720.38, 1722.38)  The Lord be with you.\n(1722.38, 1727.38)  May Almighty God bless you, the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit.\n(1727.38, 1729.38)  Go forth, the mass has ended.\n(1731.78, 1739.08)  Saint Michael, the archangel, defend us in battle and be our protection against the wickedness and snares of the devil.\n(1739.36, 1746.02)  May God rebuke him, we humbly pray, and do thou the prince of the heavenly hosts by the power of God,\n(1746.5, 1753.94)  cast into hell Satan and all the evil spirits who prowl about the world, seeking the ruin of souls. Amen.\n(1817.38, 1841.38)  Yeah.\n",

In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.\n(279.56, 286.2)  The Lord be with you. Today's mass is offered for the repose of the souls of John, Mary, and Jack\n(286.2, 291.48)  Tynan, and we celebrate a votive mass of the most precious blood of Jesus. My brothers and sisters,\n(291.48, 295.56)  let us acknowledge our sins and so prepare ourselves to celebrate the sacred mysteries.\n(297.4, 295.56) \n(302.92, 307.92)  I confess to Almighty God and to you my brothers and sisters that I have greatly sinned in my thoughts and in my words and what I have done and what I have\n(307.92, 313.02)  failed to do through my fault through my fault through my most grievous fault\n(313.02, 318.78)  therefore I ask the blessing Mary ever virgin all the angels and saints and you\n(318.78, 323.82)  my brothers and sisters to pray for me to the Lord our God may Almighty God\n(323.82, 329.24)  have mercy on us forgive us our sins and bring us to everlasting life Lord have\n(329.24, 340.2)  mercy Christ have mercy Lord have mercy let us pray Oh God who by the precious\n(340.2, 344.64)  blood of your only begotten Son have redeemed the whole world preserve in us\n(344.64, 349.52)  the work of your mercy so that ever honoring the mystery of our salvation we\n(349.52, 351.72)  we may merit to obtain its fruits.\n(351.72, 354.12)  You are Lord Jesus Christ, your son,\n(354.12, 355.96)  who lives and reigns with you in the unity\n(355.96, 358.86)  of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.\n(370.24, 372.64)  A reading from the book of Exodus.\n(373.6, 376.68)  Moses turned and came down the mountain\n(376.68, 381.04)  with the two tablets of the commandments in his hands,\n(381.04, 385.8)  tablets that were written on both sides, front and back,\n(385.8, 390.8)  tablets that were made by God, having inscriptions on them\n(390.8, 394.72)  that were engraved by God himself.\n(394.72, 397.68)  Now when Joshua heard the noise of the people shouting,\n(397.68, 402.44)  he said to Moses, that sounds like a battle in the camp.\n(402.44, 407.34)  But Moses answered, it does not sound like cries of victory,\n(407.34, 410.7)  nor does it sound like cries of defeat.\n(410.7, 414.94)  The sounds that I hear are cries of revelry.\n(414.94, 420.5)  As he drew near the camp, he saw the calf and the dancing.\n(420.5, 424.34)  With that, Moses's wrath flared up\n(424.34, 427.98)  so that he drew the tablets down and broke them\n(427.98, 430.74)  on the base of the mountain.\n(430.74, 435.06)  Taken the calf they had made, he fused it in the fire,\n(435.06, 437.78)  and then ground it down to powder,\n(437.78, 439.98)  which he scattered on the water, and made\n(439.98, 443.14)  the children of Israel drink.\n(443.14, 448.66)  Moses asked Aaron, what did this people ever do to you,\n(448.66, 452.22)  that you should lead them into so grave a sin?\n(452.22, 456.86)  Aaron replied, let not my Lord be angry.\n(456.86, 460.98)  You know well enough how prone the people are to evil.\n(460.98, 465.54)  They said to me, make us a god to be our leader.\n(465.54, 468.3)  As for the man Moses, who brought us out\n(468.3, 472.42)  of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has happened to him.\n(475.06, 480.3)  So I told them, let anyone who has gold jewelry take it off.\n(480.3, 483.14)  They gave it to me, and I threw it into the fire,\n(483.14, 485.7)  and this calf came out.\n(485.7, 489.22)  On the next day, Moses says to the people,\n(489.22, 491.82)  you have committed a grave sin.\n(491.82, 494.26)  I will go up to the Lord then.\n(494.26, 498.78)  Perhaps I may be able to make atonement for your sin.\n(498.78, 502.98)  So Moses went back to the Lord and said,\n(502.98, 506.66)  this people has indeed committed a grave sin\n(506.66, 511.46)  in making a god for themselves.\n(511.46, 514.62)  If you would only forgive their sin,\n(514.62, 517.7)  If you will not, then strike me out of the book\n(517.7, 519.94)  that you have written.\n(519.94, 525.02)  The Lord answered him, him only who has sinned against me\n(525.02, 528.02)  will I strike out of my book.\n(528.02, 532.1)  Now go and lead the people to the place I have told you.\n(532.1, 534.66)  My angel will go before you.\n(534.66, 536.82)  When it is time for me to punish,\n(536.82, 539.7)  I will punish them for their sin.\"\n(539.7, 540.62)  The word of the Lord.\n(544.46, 540.62) \n(555.92, 561.5)  The responsorial psalm, give thanks to the Lord, for He is good. Our fathers made a calf in Horeb and adored a molten image.\n(561.5, 570.14)  They exchanged their glory for the image of a grass-eating bullock.\n(570.14, 573.22)  They forgot the God who had saved them,\n(573.22, 577.38)  who had done great deeds in Egypt, wondrous deeds\n(577.38, 581.82)  in the land of Ham, terrible things at the Red Sea.\n(589.26, 591.86)  Then he spoke of exterminating them.\n(591.86, 596.66)  But Moses, his chosen one, withstood him in the breach\n(596.66, 618.36)  to turn back His destructive wrath.\n(618.36, 620.64)  The Lord be with you.\n(620.64, 626.08)  A reading from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew.\n(626.08, 629.02)  Jesus proposed a parable to the crowds.\n(629.02, 631.66)  The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed\n(631.66, 634.38)  that a person took and sowed in a field.\n(634.38, 636.58)  It is the smallest of all the seeds,\n(636.58, 639.7)  yet when full grown, it is the largest of plants.\n(639.7, 641.54)  It becomes a large bush,\n(641.54, 644.78)  and the birds of the sky come and dwell in its branches.\n(644.78, 646.7)  He spoke to them another parable.\n(646.7, 648.86)  The kingdom of heaven is like yeast\n(648.86, 650.96)  that a woman took and mixed with three measures\n(650.96, 654.58)  of wheat flour until the whole batch was leavened.\n(654.58, 658.16)  All these things Jesus spoke to the crowds in parables.\n(658.16, 659.98)  He spoke to them only in parables\n(659.98, 662.96)  to fulfill what had been said through the prophet.\n(662.96, 665.4)  I will open my mouth in parables.\n(665.4, 667.08)  I will announce what has lain hidden\n(667.08, 670.72)  from the foundation of the world, the gospel of the Lord.\n(675.62, 677.98)  Jesus speaks in parables to teach us\n(677.98, 680.96)  about the kingdom of God and how it is to be built\n(680.96, 684.16)  and how we should therefore act within it.\n(684.16, 688.18)  And so just three very simple points from today's parables.\n(688.18, 692.34)  The first is when we see Jesus gives the example\n(692.34, 694.7)  of the kingdom of God being like yeast\n(694.7, 697.02)  that is sown into bread.\n(697.02, 700.5)  The first thing we have to realize is that the flour,\n(700.5, 703.9)  though it has the capacity or the potential\n(703.9, 706.78)  to grow into something beautiful,\n(706.78, 710.02)  without the yeast, it's really worthless.\n(710.02, 712.2)  And so the same is true with the world.\n(712.2, 713.66)  The world in itself is a good,\n(713.66, 715.82)  is obviously created by God,\n(715.82, 718.62)  but something is lacking in the world\n(718.62, 723.12)  if we are not the yeast or the leaven to make it rise.\n(723.12, 727.48)  And so your life is so significant.\n(727.48, 730.1)  Your response to the mission of God is essential.\n(730.1, 734.2)  We either help raise our brothers and sisters to Christ,\n(734.2, 736.6)  or we drag them down.\n(736.6, 739.02)  And so a source of reflection for us today is,\n(739.02, 742.34)  are we being that source of leaven for the world,\n(742.34, 745.88)  rising up our colleagues, our friends, and our families.\n(745.88, 750.66)  The second is, the kingdom of God always starts small.\n(750.66, 752.36)  This should give us great confidence\n(752.36, 757.36)  because the flour in the bread far outnumbers the yeast.\n(758.28, 759.84)  And the same is true with us.\n(759.84, 763.72)  In many of our social circles, we may be in the minority.\n(764.66, 768.24)  But that's okay because the power of the yeast\n(768.24, 771.74)  when it interacts with the flour is transformative.\n(771.74, 773.72)  And the same is true with us.\n(773.72, 778.68)  If we live this witness boldly, the people around us, please God, will begin to change.\n(778.68, 780.84)  And it's often unseen.\n(780.84, 784.2)  The dough begins to rise in an unseen way.\n(784.2, 791.76)  And then finally, last but not least, we see that for the dough to rise, the yeast needs\n(791.76, 797.78)  to be placed in every nook and cranny of the flour, really kind of beaten in there.\n(797.78, 799.76)  And the same is true with us.\n(799.76, 806.76)  There is no part of public life that should remain untouched by the Christian example.\n(806.76, 813.38)  Every sphere, every office place, every street corner, every school should be imbued and\n(813.38, 815.7)  risen by our example.\n(815.7, 820.56)  And so we have to get our hands dirty and get in the middle of the world and invest\n(820.56, 826.16)  deeply in people's lives if we want to see a re-Christianization of our streets and of\n(826.16, 828.12)  of our neighborhoods and in our country.\n(829.44, 833.48)  When the kingdom of God, though grows slowly, is seen,\n(833.48, 837.38)  it is so clear, it is that tree, the mustard seed,\n(837.38, 840.52)  and every bird in the sky, every one of our friends\n(840.52, 843.44)  and families wants to take refuge in that kingdom\n(843.44, 845.4)  because we're all made for it.\n(845.4, 848.08)  And so let us stand and make our petitions known\n(848.08, 849.44)  to our Heavenly Father.\n(850.88, 853.52)  We pray for Pope Leo and for Bishop Richard Henning\n(853.52, 855.52)  and for all bishops throughout the church.\n(855.52, 858.92)  May God give them the grace to be true shepherds of souls\n(858.92, 861.52)  who help inspire us to be the leaven for the world.\n(861.52, 862.72)  We pray to the Lord.\n(864.36, 866.6)  Pray for all civil leaders, governments,\n(866.6, 868.42)  and elected officials throughout the world.\n(868.42, 871.16)  May they enact policies that protect the church\n(871.16, 873.08)  and give her the freedom to be herself.\n(873.08, 874.56)  The kingdom of God can be spread\n(874.56, 875.88)  to every corner of the globe.\n(875.88, 877.1)  We pray to the Lord.\n(878.44, 880.94)  We pray for an increase of vocations to the priesthood\n(880.94, 882.48)  and to the religious life,\n(882.48, 884.48)  especially for members from our own parishes\n(884.48, 885.48)  and our own families.\n(885.48, 889.82)  we pray to the Lord, and we pray for our beloved dead,\n(889.82, 892.42)  especially for John, Mary, and Jack Tynan,\n(892.42, 894.18)  for whom this mass is offered.\n(894.18, 896.58)  Through the mercy of God and with the help of our prayers,\n(896.58, 899.1)  may they come to see Christ face to face.\n(899.1, 900.28)  We pray to the Lord.\n(901.64, 904.7)  Heavenly Father, we make these prayers with great confidence\n(904.7, 907.3)  as we ask them through the intercession of Mary,\n(907.3, 909.2)  queen of the rosary and gate of heaven,\n(909.2, 911.6)  and we speak them in the name of Jesus, her son,\n(911.6, 913.32)  who is Lord forever and ever.\n(915.48, 922.48)  All right, we're going to move on to the next slide, please.\n(922.48, 930.48)  We're going to move on to the next slide, please.\n(930.48, 939.48)  We're going to move on to the next slide, please.\n(999.48, 1011.86)  Pray, brothers and sisters, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God, the Almighty\n(1011.86, 1021.18)  Father.\n(1021.18, 1026.78)  As we offer our oblation to your majesty, O Lord, may we draw and year in these mysteries\n(1026.78, 1029.74)  to Jesus, the mediator of the new covenant,\n(1029.74, 1032.62)  and celebrate anew the sprinkling of his blood,\n(1032.62, 1036.28)  in which lies all our salvation, through Christ our Lord.\n(1037.32, 1038.6)  The Lord be with you.\n(1039.7, 1041.06)  Lift up your hearts.\n(1042.14, 1044.6)  Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.\n(1046.1, 1049.26)  It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,\n(1049.26, 1051.64)  always and everywhere to give you thanks.\n(1051.64, 1054.38)  Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God,\n(1054.38, 1056.62)  for through the saving passion of your son,\n(1056.62, 1058.92)  the whole world has received a heart\n(1058.92, 1061.6)  to confess the infinite power of your majesty,\n(1061.6, 1064.2)  since by the wondrous power of the cross,\n(1064.2, 1066.56)  your judgment on the world is now revealed\n(1066.56, 1068.88)  and the authority of Christ crucified.\n(1068.88, 1071.5)  And so, Lord, with all the angels and saints,\n(1071.5, 1075.04)  we too give you thanks as an exaltation we acclaim.\n(1075.04, 1079.24)  Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts,\n(1079.24, 1081.92)  heaven and earth are full of your glory.\n(1081.92, 1083.92)  Hosanna in the highest.\n(1083.92, 1087.04)  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.\n(1087.04, 1088.9)  Hosanna in the highest.\n(1090.72, 1092.5)  You are indeed holy, O Lord,\n(1092.5, 1095.04)  and all you have created rightly gives you praise.\n(1095.04, 1097.74)  For through your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ,\n(1097.74, 1100.24)  by the power and working of the Holy Spirit,\n(1100.24, 1102.78)  you give life to all things and make them holy.\n(1102.78, 1105.52)  You never cease to gather a people to yourself,\n(1105.52, 1108.24)  so that from the rising of the sun to its setting,\n(1108.24, 1111.56)  a pure sacrifice may be offered to your name.\n(1111.56, 1114.28)  Therefore, O Lord, we humbly implore you,\n(1114.28, 1117.16)  by the same Spirit graciously make holy these gifts\n(1117.16, 1119.36)  we have brought to you for consecration,\n(1119.36, 1122.06)  that they may become the body and blood\n(1122.06, 1124.74)  of your Son, our Lord, Jesus Christ,\n(1124.74, 1127.52)  at whose command we celebrate these mysteries.\n(1127.52, 1130.04)  For on the night he was betrayed,\n(1130.04, 1133.04)  he himself took breath, and giving you thanks,\n(1133.04, 1135.6)  he said the blessing, broke the breath,\n(1135.6, 1138.04)  and gave it to his disciples, saying,\n(1138.96, 1138.04) \n(1148.04, 1162.86)  Take this, all of you, and eat of it, for this is my body, which will be given up for you.\n(1162.86, 1168.78)  In a similar way, when supper was ended, He took the chalice, and giving you thanks, He\n(1168.78, 1173.48)  said the blessing, and gave the chalice to His disciples, saying,\n(1173.48, 1177.74)  Take this, all of you, and drink from it.\n(1177.74, 1184.0)  For this is the chalice of My blood, the blood of the new and eternal covenant, which will\n(1184.0, 1188.44)  be poured out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins.\n(1188.44, 1206.76)  Do this in memory of me.\n(1206.76, 1213.44)  The mystery of faith, save us, savior of the world, for by your cross and resurrection\n(1213.44, 1214.72)  you have set us free.\n(1214.72, 1219.72)  Therefore, O Lord, as we celebrate the memorial of the saving passion of your Son,\n(1219.72, 1224.72)  his wondrous resurrection and ascension into heaven, and as we look forward to his second coming,\n(1224.72, 1227.72)  we offer you in thanksgiving this holy and living sacrifice.\n(1227.72, 1232.72)  Look, we pray, upon the oblation of your Church and recognizing the sacrificial victim\n(1232.72, 1235.72)  by whose death you willed to reconcile us to yourself.\n(1235.72, 1240.72)  Grant that we who are nourished by the body and blood of your Son and filled with his Holy Spirit\n(1240.72, 1243.72)  may become one body, one spirit in Christ.\n(1243.72, 1246.72)  May he make of us an eternal offering to you,\n(1246.72, 1249.48)  so that we may obtain an inheritance with your elect,\n(1249.48, 1251.56)  especially with the most blessed Virgin Mary,\n(1251.56, 1254.68)  Mother of God, with blessed Joseph, her spouse,\n(1254.68, 1257.16)  with your blessed apostles and glorious martyrs,\n(1257.16, 1258.6)  and with all the saints,\n(1258.6, 1261.12)  under constant intercession in your presence,\n(1261.12, 1263.24)  we rely for unfailing help.\n(1263.24, 1266.8)  May this sacrifice of our reconciliation, we pray, O Lord,\n(1266.8, 1269.64)  advance the peace and salvation of all the world.\n(1269.64, 1271.72)  Be pleased to confirm in faith and charity\n(1271.72, 1273.26)  your pilgrim church on earth,\n(1273.26, 1276.78)  with your servant Leo, our Pope, and Richard, our Bishop,\n(1276.78, 1279.06)  the order of bishops, all the clergy,\n(1279.06, 1281.8)  and the entire people you have gained for your own.\n(1281.8, 1284.82)  Listen graciously to the prayers of this family,\n(1284.82, 1286.68)  whom you have summoned before you,\n(1286.68, 1289.06)  in your compassion, oh merciful Father,\n(1289.06, 1290.92)  gather to yourself all your children\n(1290.92, 1292.7)  scattered throughout the world.\n(1292.7, 1294.94)  To our departed brothers and sisters,\n(1294.94, 1296.26)  and to all who are pleasing to you\n(1296.26, 1298.22)  at their passing from this life,\n(1298.22, 1300.16)  give kind admittance to your kingdom,\n(1300.16, 1303.16)  there we hope to enjoy forever the fullness of your glory,\n(1303.16, 1304.6)  through Christ our Lord,\n(1304.6, 1307.4)  through whom you bestow on the world all that is good.\n(1311.44, 1313.68)  Through him and with him and in him,\n(1313.68, 1317.56)  O God, almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\n(1317.56, 1321.02)  all glory and honor is yours forever and ever.\n(1322.72, 1326.78)  At the Savior's command, informed by divine teaching,\n(1326.78, 1328.54)  we dare to say.\n(1328.54, 1332.9)  Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.\n(1332.9, 1335.7)  Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,\n(1335.7, 1337.74)  on earth as it is in heaven.\n(1337.74, 1340.3)  Give us this day our daily bread,\n(1340.3, 1342.66)  and forgive us our trespasses,\n(1342.66, 1346.0)  as we forgive those who trespass against us,\n(1346.0, 1348.34)  and lead us not into temptation,\n(1348.34, 1350.42)  but deliver us from evil.\n(1350.42, 1352.98)  Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil.\n(1352.98, 1355.14)  Graciously grant peace in our days,\n(1355.14, 1356.6)  that by the help of your mercy,\n(1356.6, 1360.4)  we may be always free from sin and safe from all distress\n(1360.4, 1363.44)  as we await the blessed hope and the coming of our Savior,\n(1363.44, 1364.64)  Jesus Christ.\n(1369.36, 1371.8)  Lord Jesus Christ, who said to your apostles,\n(1371.8, 1374.04)  peace I leave you, my peace I give you.\n(1374.04, 1376.86)  Look not in our sins, but on the faith of your church\n(1376.86, 1378.84)  and graciously grant her peace and unity\n(1378.84, 1380.3)  in accordance with your will,\n(1380.3, 1382.64)  who live and reign forever and ever.\n(1382.64, 1385.72)  The peace of the Lord be with you always.\n(1385.72, 1387.92)  Let us offer each other the sign of peace.\n(1390.68, 1394.28)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world,\n(1394.28, 1396.1)  have mercy on us.\n(1396.1, 1399.52)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world,\n(1399.52, 1401.36)  have mercy on us.\n(1401.36, 1404.48)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world,\n(1404.48, 1405.82)  grant us peace.\n(1415.72, 1426.4)  Behold the Lamb of God, behold him who takes away the sins of the world.\n(1426.4, 1429.04)  Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb.\n(1429.04, 1434.94)  Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof, but only say the word and my\n(1434.94, 1441.94)  soul shall be healed.\n(1464.94, 1479.14)  The chalice of blessing that we bless is a communion in the blood of Christ and the bread\n(1479.14, 1482.14)  that we break is a sharing in the body of the Lord.\n(1719.14, 1741.0)  Let us pray, Refreshed, O Lord, by the saving food and drink, we pray that we may always\n(1741.0, 1746.1)  be bathed in the blood of our Savior, so that it may become for us a spring of water welling\n(1746.1, 1752.82)  up to eternal life through Christ our Lord. The Lord be with you. May almighty God...\n",

        "transcript": "(209.0, 216.0)  So, thank you very much for joining us today, and we'll see you in the next session.\n(239.0, 268.88)  How beautiful you are, O Virgin of Christ, how beautiful you are, O Virgin of Christ,\n(268.88, 274.16)  Christ, who are worthy to receive the Lord's crown, the crown of perpetual virginity.\n(274.16, 277.02)  In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.\n(277.02, 278.02)  Amen.\n(278.02, 280.02)  The Lord be with you.\n(280.02, 284.52)  Today's Mass is offered for our parishioners and we celebrate the feast day of St. Kateri\n(284.52, 285.82)  Tekakwitha.\n(285.82, 290.12)  My brothers and sisters, let us acknowledge our sins and so prepare ourselves to celebrate\n(290.12, 293.96)  the sacred mysteries.\n(293.96, 300.78)  I confess to Almighty God and to you, my brothers and sisters, that I have greatly sinned in\n(300.78, 306.02)  my thoughts and in my words in what I have done and what I have failed to do through\n(306.02, 310.54)  my fault, through my fault, through my most grievous fault.\n(310.54, 316.42)  Therefore I ask the Blessed Mary of our Virgin, all the angels and saints, and you, my brothers\n(316.42, 320.24)  and sisters, to pray for me to the Lord our God.\n(320.24, 326.0)  May almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us our sins and bring us to everlasting life.\n(326.0, 334.16)  Lord have mercy, Christ have mercy, Lord have mercy.\n(334.16, 337.44)  Let us pray.\n(337.44, 343.72)  O God who desired the virgin blessed Kateri Tekukwitha to flower among the Native Americans\n(343.72, 348.88)  in a life of innocence, grant through her intercession that when all are gathered into\n(348.88, 352.2)  to your church from every nation, tribe, and tongue,\n(352.2, 355.68)  they may magnify you in a single canticle of praise.\n(355.68, 358.04)  Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your son,\n(358.04, 359.36)  who lives and reigns with you\n(359.36, 362.88)  in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God forever and ever.\n(378.88, 384.72)  A reading from the book of Exodus. A new king who knew nothing of Joseph came to\n(384.72, 390.08)  power in Egypt. He said to his subjects look how numerous and powerful the\n(390.08, 395.56)  people of the children of Israel are growing more so than we ourselves. Come\n(395.56, 401.16)  let us deal shrewdly with them to stop their increase otherwise in time of war\n(401.16, 407.08)  they too may join our enemies to fight against us and so leave our country.\n(407.08, 412.24)  Accordingly, taskmasters were set over the children of Israel to oppress them\n(412.24, 418.88)  with forced labor. Thus they had to build for Pharaoh the supply cities of Pithom\n(418.88, 423.64)  and Rameses. Yet the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and\n(423.64, 428.72)  spread. The Egyptians then dreaded the children of Israel and reduced them to\n(428.72, 434.2)  cruel slavery, making life bitter for them with hard work in mortar and brick,\n(434.2, 441.08)  and all kinds of fieldwork, the whole cruel fate of slaves. Pharaoh then\n(441.08, 445.8)  commanded all his subjects, throw into the river every boy that is born to the\n(445.8, 452.64)  Hebrews, but you may let all the girls live. This is the word of the Lord.\n(453.2, 461.0)  Responsorial Psalm, our help is in the name of the Lord. Had not the Lord been\n(461.0, 466.44)  with us, let Israel say, had not the Lord been with us, when men rose up against us,\n(466.44, 474.0)  then would they have swallowed us alive, when their fury was inflamed against us.\n(474.6, 479.72)  Then would the waters have overwhelmed us, the torrent would have swept over us.\n(479.72, 485.64)  Over us then would have swept the raging waters. Blessed be the Lord, who did not\n(485.64, 493.8)  leave us a prey to their teeth. We were rescued like a bird from the foulest\n(493.8, 499.96)  sneer. Broken was the sneer and we were freed. I help us in the name of the Lord\n(499.96, 503.52)  who made heaven and earth.\n(515.64, 528.04)  The Lord be with you. A reading from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew. Jesus\n(528.04, 532.68)  said to his apostles do not think that I have come to bring peace upon the earth\n(532.68, 538.0)  I have come to bring not peace but the sword for I have come to set a man\n(538.0, 542.8)  against his father a daughter against her mother and a daughter-in-law against\n(542.8, 548.62)  or mother-in-law, and one's enemies will be those of his household. Whoever loves father\n(548.62, 553.72)  or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever loves son or daughter more than\n(553.72, 559.5)  me is not worthy of me, and whoever does not take up his cross and follow after me is not\n(559.5, 565.46)  worthy of me. Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my\n(565.46, 572.1)  sake will find it. Whoever receives you receives me, and whoever receives me receives the one\n(572.1, 577.02)  who sent me. Whoever receives a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a\n(577.02, 581.62)  prophet's reward. And whoever receives a righteous man because he is righteous\n(581.62, 586.82)  will receive a righteous man's reward. And whoever gives only a cup of cold\n(586.82, 591.74)  water to one of these little ones to drink because he is a disciple, amen I\n(591.74, 596.9)  say to you, he will surely not lose his reward. When Jesus finished giving these\n(596.9, 601.78)  commands to his twelve disciples, he went away from that place to teach and to\n(601.78, 613.92)  preach in their towns the gospel of the Lord in response to the claim that the\n(613.92, 618.52)  Christians were responsible for the sack of Rome st. Augustine wrote his very\n(618.52, 624.72)  famous work called the City of God in year 410 and to prove that the reason\n(624.72, 630.64)  Rome fell was not because they rejected their pagan practices Augustine says\n(630.64, 636.64)  that really Rome fell because of the individual moral decay in the hearts of\n(636.64, 641.42)  all of her citizens and to prove this point he sets up a framework between two\n(641.42, 648.38)  cities the city of man and then the city of God and he says every single person\n(648.38, 655.18)  is a citizen of either one of these cities either were a citizen of the city\n(655.18, 663.06)  of man, or were a citizen of the city of God, and to determine what city we live in, all\n(663.06, 668.26)  we have to ask ourselves is what do we love?\n(668.26, 674.98)  Augustine says in that so beautifully that whatever you love determines your citizenship.\n(674.98, 681.18)  And so he says, more often than not, we live in the city of man if we desire worldly fame,\n(681.18, 689.28)  pleasure, success, over the will of God. To be in the City of God means we put\n(689.28, 695.0)  priority of God's will over everything else in our life. I share this with you\n(695.0, 700.08)  because Augustine says throughout that work that this is the true meaning of\n(700.08, 704.96)  peace. In fact, this is why our Lord says at the start of this gospel, I didn't\n(704.96, 710.48)  come to bring peace on the earth, but a sword, because to live in the City of God\n(710.48, 716.56)  There are certain things in our lives that need to be burned away, certain attachments\n(716.56, 719.88)  or loves that we have above Him.\n(719.88, 724.56)  All we have to do is look to the saint we celebrate today, St. Kateri Tekikwetha, who\n(724.56, 727.38)  was the very first saint in the New World.\n(727.38, 732.72)  And her, just like all of the saints, though their holiness is incredibly attractive, is\n(732.72, 735.12)  not always received well.\n(735.12, 739.68)  She was rejected by her entire people, even her own family.\n(739.68, 747.52)  But she lived in the city of God, and the city of God is the only eternal city.\n(747.52, 752.4)  And so heaven begins here, and that's why with the grace of this mass and the intercession\n(752.4, 758.7)  of St. Kateri, we ask God to examine our lives, to figure out what city we're in, so that\n(758.7, 762.64)  our lives can live with him in his eternal city in heaven.\n(762.64, 768.6)  And so let us stand and make our petitions known to our Heavenly Father.\n(768.6, 771.0)  We pray for Pope Leo and for Bishop Richard Henning\n(771.0, 773.04)  and for all bishops throughout the church.\n(773.04, 775.98)  May God give them the grace to be true shepherds of souls\n(775.98, 779.04)  who point us into the city of God, we pray to the Lord.\n(780.28, 782.2)  We pray for all civil leaders, governments,\n(782.2, 784.12)  and elected officials throughout the world.\n(784.12, 786.88)  May they enact policies that protect the church\n(786.88, 788.8)  and give her the freedom to be herself\n(788.8, 790.6)  so the kingdom of God can be spread\n(790.6, 793.36)  to every corner of the globe, we pray to the Lord.\n(794.74, 797.4)  We pray for an increase of vocations to the priesthood\n(797.4, 799.88)  into the religious life, especially from members\n(799.88, 802.56)  from our own parishes and our own families.\n(802.56, 805.44)  May God call many men and women to give their lives\n(805.44, 807.88)  entirely to building his city and his kingdom,\n(807.88, 809.04)  we pray to the Lord.\n(810.6, 813.4)  We pray for our parishioners for whom this mass is offered,\n(813.4, 814.62)  we pray to the Lord.\n(815.98, 819.04)  Heavenly Father, we make these prayers with great confidence\n(819.04, 821.56)  as we ask them the intercession of St. Kateri,\n(821.56, 825.36)  Tequitha and Mary, our morning star and gate of heaven.\n(825.36, 827.8)  and we speak it in the name of Jesus, her son,\n(827.8, 829.86)  who is Lord forever and ever.\n(829.86, 830.7)  Amen.\n(855.36, 862.36)  So, thank you very much for joining us today, and we'll see you in the next session.\n(915.36, 921.36)  Pray, brothers and sisters, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God, the Almighty Father.\n(930.36, 935.36)  As we proclaim your wonders, O Lord, in the Virgin Blessed Kateri Tekakwitha,\n(935.36, 940.36)  we humbly implore your majesty that as her merits are pleasing to you,\n(940.36, 944.36)  so too our dutiful service may find favor in your sight\n(944.36, 947.36)  through Christ our Lord.\n(947.36, 952.72)  The Lord be with you, lift up your hearts.\n(952.72, 956.48)  Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.\n(956.48, 960.68)  It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, always and everywhere to give\n(960.68, 961.68)  you thanks.\n(961.68, 966.54)  Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God, for in the saints who consecrated themselves\n(966.54, 971.3)  to Christ for the sake of the kingdom of heaven, it is right to celebrate the wonders of your\n(971.3, 976.58)  your providence, by which you call human nature back to its original holiness, and bring it\n(976.58, 981.44)  to experience on this earth the gifts you promised in the new world to come. And so\n(981.44, 988.1)  with all the angels and saints, we praise you, as without end we acclaim. Holy, holy,\n(988.1, 995.1)  holy, Lord God of hosts, heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest.\n(995.1, 999.1)  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.\n(999.1, 1001.1)  Hosanna in the highest.\n(1003.1, 1005.1)  You are indeed holy, O Lord,\n(1005.1, 1007.1)  and all you have created rightly gives you praise.\n(1007.1, 1010.1)  For through your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ,\n(1010.1, 1012.1)  by the power and working of the Holy Spirit,\n(1012.1, 1015.1)  you give life to all things and make them holy,\n(1015.1, 1018.1)  and you never cease to gather a people to yourself,\n(1018.1, 1021.1)  so that from the rising of the sun to its setting,\n(1021.1, 1024.1)  a pure sacrifice may be offered to your name.\n(1024.1, 1029.82)  Therefore, O Lord, we humbly implore you, by the same Spirit graciously make holy these\n(1029.82, 1035.34)  gifts we have brought to you for consecration, that they may become the Body and Blood of\n(1035.34, 1041.3)  your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, at whose command we celebrate these mysteries.\n(1041.3, 1047.06)  For on the night he was betrayed, he himself took bread, and giving you thanks, he said\n(1047.06, 1053.3)  the blessing, broke the bread, and gave it to his disciples, saying,\n(1053.3, 1062.3)  Take this, all of you, and eat of it, for this is my body, which will be given up for\n(1062.3, 1077.24)  you.\n(1077.24, 1083.1)  In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took the chalice, and giving you thanks he\n(1083.1, 1088.54)  said the blessing, and gave the chalice to his disciples, saying,\n(1088.54, 1096.06)  Take this, all of you, and drink from it, for this is the chalice of my blood,\n(1096.06, 1099.98)  the blood of the new and eternal covenant, which will be poured out for\n(1099.98, 1103.26)  you and for many for the forgiveness of sins.\n(1103.26, 1107.58)  Do this in memory of me.\n(1113.1, 1123.58)  The mystery of faith.\n(1123.58, 1129.14)  Save us, Savior of the world, for by your cross and resurrection you have set us free.\n(1129.14, 1134.7)  Therefore, O Lord, as we celebrate the memorial of the saving passion of your Son, his wondrous\n(1134.7, 1139.26)  resurrection and ascension into heaven, and as we look forward to his second coming, we\n(1139.26, 1142.7)  offer you in thanksgiving this holy and living sacrifice.\n(1142.7, 1147.36)  Book we pray upon the oblation of your Church, and recognizing the sacrificial victim by\n(1147.36, 1151.98)  whose death you willed to reconcile us to yourself, grant that we who are nourished\n(1151.98, 1157.0)  by the Body and Blood of your Son, and filled with his Holy Spirit, may become one Body,\n(1157.0, 1158.6)  one Spirit in Christ.\n(1158.6, 1162.78)  May he make of us an eternal offering to you, so that we may obtain an inheritance with\n(1162.78, 1168.14)  your elect, especially with the most blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God, with blessed Joseph\n(1168.14, 1170.34)  with her spouse, with your blessed apostles\n(1170.34, 1172.98)  and glorious martyrs, with Saint Kateri,\n(1172.98, 1174.5)  and with all the saints,\n(1174.5, 1176.94)  on whose constant intercession in your presence,\n(1176.94, 1179.06)  we rely for unfailing help.\n(1179.06, 1182.66)  May this sacrifice of our reconciliation, we pray, O Lord,\n(1182.66, 1185.54)  advance the peace and salvation of all the world.\n(1185.54, 1187.5)  Be pleased to confirm in faith and charity\n(1187.5, 1188.94)  your pilgrim church on earth,\n(1188.94, 1192.58)  with your servant Leo, our pope, and Richard, our bishop,\n(1192.58, 1194.7)  the order of bishops, all the clergy,\n(1194.7, 1197.62)  and the entire people you have gained for your own.\n(1197.62, 1200.74)  Listen graciously to the prayers of this family,\n(1200.74, 1202.78)  whom you have summoned before you.\n(1202.78, 1205.22)  In your compassion, O merciful Father,\n(1205.22, 1207.02)  gather to yourself all your children\n(1207.02, 1208.58)  scattered throughout the world.\n(1208.58, 1210.82)  To our departed brothers and sisters,\n(1210.82, 1212.14)  and to all who are pleasing to you\n(1212.14, 1214.1)  at their passing from this life,\n(1214.1, 1216.0)  give kind admittance to your kingdom.\n(1216.0, 1218.9)  There we hope to enjoy forever the fullness of your glory,\n(1218.9, 1220.34)  through Christ our Lord,\n(1220.34, 1223.22)  through whom you bestow on the world all that is good.\n(1227.62, 1233.58)  Through him, and with him, and in him, O God Almighty Father, in the unity of the\n(1233.58, 1242.86)  Holy Spirit, all glory and honor is yours forever and ever.\" At the Savior's command,\n(1242.86, 1249.3)  informed by divine teaching, we dare to say, our Father, who art in heaven,\n(1249.3, 1255.22)  hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in\n(1255.22, 1262.26)  in heaven, give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive\n(1262.26, 1269.58)  those who trespass against us, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.\n(1269.58, 1274.54)  Deliver us Lord we pray from every evil, graciously grant peace in our days, that by the help\n(1274.54, 1279.52)  of your mercy we may be always free from sin, and safe from all distress, as we await the\n(1279.52, 1287.76)  blessed hope in the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ.\n(1287.76, 1292.42)  Lord Jesus Christ who said to your apostles, peace I leave you, my peace I give you, look\n(1292.42, 1297.06)  not on our sins but on the faith of your church and graciously grant her peace and unity in\n(1297.06, 1301.02)  accordance with your will, who live and reign forever and ever.\n(1301.02, 1309.28)  The peace of the Lord be with you always, let us offer each other the sign of peace.\n(1309.28, 1314.48)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1314.48, 1319.68)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1319.68, 1338.96)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, grant us peace.\n(1338.96, 1341.24)  Behold the Lamb of God.\n(1341.24, 1344.36)  Behold him who takes away the sins of the world.\n(1344.36, 1347.62)  Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb.\n(1347.62, 1351.5)  Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof,\n(1351.5, 1354.56)  but only say the word and my soul shall be healed.\n(1368.96, 1375.96)  There is one thing I ask of you, and that is, do you have any idea how many times I've\n(1398.96, 1402.5)  I ask of the Lord, only this do I seek,\n(1402.5, 1404.56)  to live in the house of the Lord\n(1404.56, 1407.56)  the days of my life.\n(1523.56, 1551.56)  So, thank you very much for your attention and we'll see you in the next session.\n(1551.56, 1558.56)  So, thank you very much.\n(1611.56, 1635.64)  Let us pray.\n(1635.64, 1641.54)  Renewed by partaking of this divine gift, we pray, O Lord our God, that by the example\n(1641.54, 1648.54)  Saint Michael, the Archangel, defend us in battle. Be our protection against the wickedness and snares of the devil.\n(1648.54, 1651.54)  Be our protection against the wickedness and snares of the devil.\n(1651.54, 1654.54)  Be our protection against the wickedness and snares of the devil.\n(1654.54, 1657.54)  Be our protection against the wickedness and snares of the devil.\n(1657.54, 1660.54)  Be our protection against the wickedness and snares of the devil.\n(1660.54, 1663.54)  Be our protection against the wickedness and snares of the devil.\n(1663.54, 1666.54)  Be our protection against the wickedness and snares of the devil.\n(1666.54, 1669.54)  Be our protection against the wickedness and snares of the devil.\n(1669.54, 1675.3)  and snares of the devil. May God rebuke him, we humbly pray, and do thou with a\n(1675.3, 1680.5)  prince of the heavenly hosts, by the power of God cast into hell Satan and\n(1680.5, 1688.26)  all the evil spirits who prowl about the world, seeking the ruin of souls. Amen.\n(1728.54, 1733.54)  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n(1763.54, 1770.54)  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,\n(1770.54, 1781.54)  yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,\n(1781.54, 1791.54)  yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,\n",

Therefore, I ask the Blessed Mary, Ever-Virgin, all the angels and saints, and you, my brothers and sisters, to pray for me to the Lord our God.\n(320.5, 327.5)  May almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us our sins and bring us to everlasting life.\n(327.5, 329.78)  Lord have mercy.\n(329.78, 332.36)  Christ have mercy.\n(332.36, 335.32)  Lord have mercy.\n(335.32, 337.32)  Let us pray.\n(337.32, 344.98)  O God, who desired the Virgin Blessed Kateri Tekukwitha to flower among Native Americans\n(344.98, 350.16)  in the life of innocence, grant through her intercession that when all are gathered into\n(350.16, 353.6)  of your church, from every nation, tribe, and tongue,\n(353.6, 357.52)  they may magnify you in a single canticle of praise.\n(357.52, 360.02)  You are Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,\n(360.02, 361.8)  who lives and reigns with you in the unity\n(361.8, 364.82)  of the Holy Spirit, God forever and ever.\n(375.68, 364.82) \n(378.78, 384.98)  A reading from the book of Exodus. A new king who knew nothing of Joseph came to power in Egypt.\n(384.98, 390.78)  He said to his subjects, look how numerous and powerful the people of the children of\n(390.78, 396.02)  Israel are growing, more so than we ourselves.\n(396.02, 403.62)  Come let us deal shrewdly with them to stop their increase, otherwise in time of war they\n(403.62, 410.7)  too may join our enemies to fight against us and so leave our country.\n(410.7, 416.5)  Accordingly taskmasters were fed over the children of Israel to oppress them with forced\n(416.5, 417.5)  labor.\n(417.5, 425.5)  Thus they had to build for Pharaoh the supply cities of Pithom and Ramses, yet the more\n(425.5, 430.1)  they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread.\n(430.1, 437.14)  The Egyptians then dreaded the children of Israel and reduced them to cruel slavery,\n(437.14, 444.66)  making life bitter for them with hard work and mortar and brick and all kinds of fieldwork,\n(444.66, 448.34)  the whole cruel fate of slaves.\n(448.34, 451.78)  Pharaoh then commanded all his subjects,\n(451.78, 456.46)  throw into the river every boy that is born to the Hebrews.\n(456.46, 459.14)  But you may let all the girls live.\n(459.14, 460.06)  The word of the Lord.\n(463.98, 466.94)  The response to the real psalm, our help\n(466.94, 468.34)  is in the name of the Lord.\n(471.66, 474.02)  Had not the Lord been with us, let\n(474.02, 480.58)  Let Israel say, Had not the LORD been with us, when men rose up against us, then would\n(480.58, 489.06)  they have swallowed us alive, when their fury was inflamed against us.\n(489.06, 494.98)  Then would the waters have overwhelmed us, the torrent would have swept over us, over\n(494.98, 499.9)  us then would have swept the raging waters.\n(499.9, 507.54)  be the Lord, who did not leave us or pray to their teeth.\n(507.54, 512.12)  We were rescued like a bird from the fowler's snare.\n(512.12, 515.46)  Broken was the snare, and we were freed.\n(515.46, 539.46)  Our help is in the name of the Lord, who made heaven and earth.\n(539.46, 540.76)  The Lord be with you.\n(541.8, 544.6)  A reading from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew.\n(546.76, 548.96)  Jesus said to his apostles,\n(548.96, 552.44)  do not think that I have come to bring peace upon the earth.\n(552.44, 555.46)  I have come to bring not peace but the sword.\n(555.46, 558.08)  For I have come to set a man against his father,\n(558.08, 559.96)  a daughter against her mother,\n(559.96, 562.54)  and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law,\n(562.54, 565.56)  and one's enemies will be those of his household.\n(565.56, 568.0)  Whoever loves father or mother more than me\n(568.0, 569.56)  is not worthy of me.\n(569.56, 571.92)  And whoever loves son or daughter more than me\n(571.92, 573.94)  is not worthy of me.\n(573.94, 576.16)  And whoever does not take up his cross\n(576.16, 579.08)  and follow after me is not worthy of me.\n(579.08, 581.28)  Whoever finds his life will lose it.\n(581.28, 584.84)  And whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.\n(584.84, 587.2)  Whoever receives you receives me.\n(587.2, 590.76)  And whoever receives me receives the one who sent me.\n(590.76, 593.68)  Whoever receives a prophet because he is a prophet\n(593.68, 595.92)  will receive a prophet's reward.\n(595.92, 597.76)  And whoever receives a righteous man\n(597.76, 599.4)  because he is righteous,\n(599.4, 601.92)  will receive a righteous man's reward.\n(601.92, 604.3)  And whoever gives only a cup of cold water\n(604.3, 606.44)  to one of these little ones to drink\n(606.44, 609.88)  because he is a disciple, amen, I say to you,\n(609.88, 612.56)  he will surely not lose his reward.\n(612.56, 614.52)  When Jesus finished giving these commands\n(614.52, 617.56)  to his 12 disciples, he went away from that place\n(617.56, 620.64)  to teach and to preach in their towns.\n(620.64, 622.08)  The gospel of the Lord.\n(627.4, 622.08) \n(632.08, 637.08)  In response to the critique that the Christians were responsible for the sack of Rome, St. Augustine wrote his famous work called The City of God in the year 410.\n(637.08, 642.08)  And in order to prove that the Christians were innocent of this accusation,\n(642.08, 650.08)  he demonstrated very well that Rome actually fell because of a moral decay in its citizens.\n(650.08, 653.42)  And he sets this up by describing two cities.\n(653.42, 656.3)  He says there's the city of man,\n(656.3, 658.86)  and then there's also the city of God.\n(658.86, 661.26)  And he brilliantly says that every person,\n(661.26, 663.8)  and this is what applies to us today,\n(663.8, 667.38)  is a citizen of one of those two cities.\n(667.38, 670.02)  We're either a citizen of the city of man,\n(670.02, 673.3)  or we're a citizen of the city of God.\n(673.3, 677.98)  And our citizenship is determined by our loves.\n(677.98, 684.6)  Augustine says so well coming from Christ show me where your treasure is and there your heart will be\n(685.18, 689.28)  He says those in the city of God. I mean in the city of man, excuse me\n(690.22, 692.22)  value things of the earth\n(692.48, 694.48)  above the will of God\n(694.66, 700.8)  He's so interesting because Augustine actually points to this passage in the gospel because he said even sometimes\n(701.38, 704.76)  The things we value above God are not bad in themselves\n(706.02, 704.76) \n(712.44, 719.72)  But, the freedom, the joy, the flourishing that comes from being in the City of God, loving His will above all else, is what Augustine says finally gives the heart rest.\n(719.72, 725.52)  St. Kateri Tequitha, though she never read the City of God, her, like all the saints,\n(725.52, 727.88)  verify the truth of this claim.\n(727.88, 732.0)  When we strive to live in the City of God, initially there will be some tension.\n(732.0, 738.88)  We may see rejection or criticism from our family, from our community, our friends, but\n(738.88, 744.08)  the beauty of this life eventually attracts all those around us.\n(744.08, 749.68)  And so today we would do well to reflect on those words in the gospel and ask ourselves,\n(749.68, 752.2)  in what city am I living in today?\n(752.2, 758.96)  And so let us ask God to hear our prayers as we make our petitions known to him.\n(758.96, 763.46)  We pray for Pope Leo and for Bishop Richard Henning and for all bishops throughout the\n(763.46, 764.46)  church.\n(764.46, 769.34)  May God give him the grace to be true shepherds of souls who point us to the beauty of living\n(769.34, 770.5)  in the city of God.\n(770.5, 773.38)  We pray to the Lord.\n(773.38, 777.52)  We pray for all civil leaders, governments, and elected officials throughout the world.\n(777.52, 782.22)  May they enact policies that protect the church and give her the freedom to be herself so\n(782.22, 785.7)  the kingdom of God can be spread to every corner of the globe.\n(785.7, 788.72)  We pray to the Lord.\n(788.72, 794.16)  We pray for an increase of vocations to the priesthood and to the religious life, especially\n(794.16, 797.52)  for members from our own parishes and our own families.\n(797.52, 799.96)  We pray to the Lord.\n(799.96, 804.72)  We pray for the repose of the souls of Buddy Earner and Kristen Trail, for whom this Mass\n(804.72, 805.72)  is offered.\n(805.72, 809.64)  Through the mercy of God and with the help of our prayers, may they come to see Christ\n(809.64, 810.88)  face to face.\n(810.88, 813.68)  We pray to the Lord.\n(813.68, 817.32)  Heavenly Father, we make these prayers with great confidence as we ask them through the\n(817.32, 821.76)  intercession of Saint Kateri Tekakwetha and Mary, our Morning Star and Gate of\n(821.76, 826.06)  Heaven, and we speak them in the name of Jesus, her Son, who is Lord, forever and ever.\n(826.06, 828.06)  Amen.\n(907.32, 934.12)  Pray, brothers and sisters, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God, the Almighty\n(934.12, 935.12)  Father.\n(935.12, 949.6)  As we proclaim your wonders, O Lord, in the Virgin Blessed Kateri, we humbly implore your\n(949.6, 955.88)  majesty that as her merits are pleasing to you, so too our dutiful service may find favor\n(955.88, 960.0)  in your sight, through Christ our Lord.\n(960.0, 965.1)  The Lord be with you, lift up your hearts.\n(965.1, 968.86)  Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.\n(968.86, 973.22)  It is truly right in just our duty and our salvation, always and everywhere to give you\n(973.22, 977.02)  thanks, Lord Holy Father Almighty and Eternal God.\n(977.02, 982.42)  For in the saints who consecrated themselves to Christ for the sake of the kingdom of heaven,\n(982.42, 987.02)  it is right to celebrate the wonders of your providence, by which you call human nature\n(987.02, 992.06)  back to its original holiness, and bring it to experience on this earth the gifts you\n(992.06, 994.86)  promised in the new world to come.\n(994.86, 997.24)  And so with all the angels and saints,\n(997.24, 1000.26)  we praise you as without end we acclaim.\n(1000.26, 1004.46)  Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts,\n(1004.46, 1007.1)  heaven and earth are full of your glory.\n(1007.1, 1009.14)  Hosanna in the highest.\n(1009.14, 1012.38)  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.\n(1012.38, 1013.9)  Hosanna in the highest.\n(1016.82, 1018.86)  You are indeed holy, O Lord,\n(1018.86, 1021.66)  and all you have created rightly gives you praise.\n(1021.66, 1024.38)  For through your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ,\n(1024.38, 1026.88)  By the power and working of the Holy Spirit,\n(1026.88, 1029.56)  you give light to all things and make them holy,\n(1029.56, 1032.44)  and you never cease to gather a people to yourself,\n(1032.44, 1035.26)  so that from the rising of the sun to its setting,\n(1035.26, 1038.68)  a pure sacrifice may be offered to your name.\n(1038.68, 1041.48)  Therefore, O Lord, we humbly implore you,\n(1041.48, 1043.78)  by the same Spirit graciously make holy\n(1043.78, 1046.64)  these gifts we have brought to you for consecration,\n(1046.64, 1049.62)  that they may become the body and blood\n(1049.62, 1052.32)  of your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ,\n(1052.32, 1055.36)  at whose command we celebrate these mysteries.\n(1055.36, 1058.0)  For on the night he was betrayed,\n(1058.0, 1060.08)  he himself took bread.\n(1060.08, 1062.68)  In giving you thanks, he said the blessing,\n(1062.68, 1066.38)  broke the bread, and gave it to his disciples, saying,\n(1067.56, 1072.08)  take this, all of you, and eat of it.\n(1072.08, 1077.08)  For this is my body, which will be given up for you.\n(1080.06, 1077.08) \n(1098.0, 1102.92)  In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took the chalice, and giving you thanks he said the blessing, and gave the chalice to his disciples, saying,\n(1102.92, 1111.64)  Take this, all of you, and drink from it, for this is the chalice of my blood, the blood\n(1111.64, 1116.34)  of the new and eternal covenant, which will be poured out for you and for many for the\n(1116.34, 1118.48)  forgiveness of sins.\n(1118.48, 1120.72)  Do this in memory of me.\n(1132.92, 1142.86)  The mystery of faith. Save us, Savior of the world, for by your cross and resurrection,\n(1142.86, 1148.44)  you have set us free. Therefore, O Lord, as we celebrate the memorial of the saving passion\n(1148.44, 1153.16)  of your Son, his wondrous resurrection and ascension into heaven, and as we look forward\n(1153.16, 1158.8)  to his second coming, we offer you in thanksgiving this holy and living sacrifice. Look, we pray,\n(1158.8, 1160.8)  upon the oblation of your church,\n(1160.8, 1162.86)  in recognizing the sacrificial victim\n(1162.86, 1166.12)  by whose death you willed to reconcile us to yourself.\n(1166.12, 1167.58)  Grant that we who are nourished\n(1167.58, 1169.62)  by the body and blood of your son,\n(1169.62, 1171.04)  and filled with this Holy Spirit,\n(1171.04, 1173.98)  may become one body, one spirit in Christ.\n(1173.98, 1176.58)  May he make of us an eternal offering to you,\n(1176.58, 1179.34)  so that we may obtain an inheritance with your elect,\n(1179.34, 1182.66)  especially with the most blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God,\n(1182.66, 1184.62)  with blessed Joseph, her spouse,\n(1184.62, 1187.1)  with your blessed apostles and glorious martyrs,\n(1187.1, 1189.88)  with Saint Kateri, and with all the saints,\n(1189.88, 1192.38)  on whose constant intercession in your presence,\n(1192.38, 1194.5)  we rely for unfailing help.\n(1194.5, 1198.16)  May this sacrifice of our reconciliation, we pray, O Lord,\n(1198.16, 1201.02)  advance the peace and salvation of all the world.\n(1201.02, 1203.02)  Be pleased to confirm in faith and charity\n(1203.02, 1204.5)  your pilgrim church on earth,\n(1204.5, 1208.22)  with your servant Leo, our pope, and Richard, our bishop,\n(1208.22, 1210.46)  the order of bishops, all the clergy,\n(1210.46, 1213.62)  and the entire people you have gained for your own.\n(1213.62, 1216.7)  Listen graciously to the prayers of this family,\n(1216.7, 1218.58)  whom you have summoned before you.\n(1218.58, 1220.98)  In your compassion, O merciful Father,\n(1220.98, 1222.82)  gather to yourself all your children\n(1222.82, 1224.54)  scattered throughout the world.\n(1224.54, 1226.82)  To our departed brothers and sisters,\n(1226.82, 1228.14)  and to all who are pleasing to you\n(1228.14, 1230.06)  at their passing from this light,\n(1230.06, 1232.04)  give kind admittance to your kingdom.\n(1232.04, 1235.14)  There we hope to enjoy forever the fullness of your glory,\n(1235.14, 1236.66)  through Christ our Lord,\n(1236.66, 1239.42)  through whom you bestow on the world all that is good.\n(1243.34, 1245.8)  Through him and with him and in him,\n(1245.8, 1249.76)  O God, almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\n(1249.76, 1253.56)  all glory and honor is yours, forever and ever.\n(1255.48, 1259.58)  At the Savior's command, informed by divine teaching,\n(1259.58, 1263.98)  we dare to say, our Father, who art in heaven,\n(1263.98, 1265.64)  hallowed be thy name.\n(1265.64, 1268.44)  Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,\n(1268.44, 1270.44)  on earth as it is in heaven.\n(1270.44, 1273.02)  Give us this day our daily bread,\n(1273.02, 1275.44)  and forgive us our trespasses,\n(1275.44, 1278.88)  as we forgive those who trespass against us\n(1278.88, 1283.32)  and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.\n(1283.32, 1285.96)  Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil.\n(1285.96, 1288.12)  Graciously grant peace in our days,\n(1288.12, 1289.54)  that by the help of your mercy,\n(1289.54, 1293.32)  we may be always free from sin and safe from all distress,\n(1293.32, 1294.6)  as we await the blessed hope\n(1294.6, 1297.2)  and the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ.\n(1301.82, 1304.38)  Lord Jesus Christ, who said to your apostles,\n(1304.38, 1309.42)  peace I leave you my peace I give you look not in our sins but on the faith of your church\n(1309.42, 1313.58)  and graciously grant your peace and unity in accordance with your will who live and reign\n(1313.58, 1320.22)  forever and ever the peace of the lord be with you always let us offer each other the sign of peace\n(1323.18, 1330.7)  lamb of god you take away the sins of the world have mercy on us lamb of god you take away the\n(1330.7, 1333.94)  the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1333.94, 1337.34)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world.\n(1337.34, 1338.54)  Grant us peace.\n(1356.86, 1359.14)  Behold the Lamb of God.\n(1359.14, 1362.14)  Behold him who takes away the sins of the world.\n(1362.14, 1365.26)  Blessed are those called to the supper of the lay.\n(1365.26, 1369.1)  Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof,\n(1369.1, 1372.14)  but only say the word and my soul shall be healed.\n(1389.14, 1415.7)  There is one thing I ask of the Lord, only this do I seek, to live in the house of the\n(1415.7, 1417.7)  all the days of my life.\n(1655.7, 1664.84)  Let us pray.\n(1664.84, 1670.3)  Renewed by partaking of this divine gift, we pray, O Lord our God, that by the example\n(1670.3, 1677.18)  of the blessed kateri, tekequitha, bearing in our body the death of Jesus, we may strive\n(1677.18, 1682.38)  to hold fast to you alone, through Christ our Lord.\n(1682.38, 1684.66)  The Lord be with you.\n(1684.66, 1689.66)  May almighty God bless you, the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit.\n(1689.66, 1692.66)  Go forth, the Mass is ended.\n(1692.66, 1696.66)  Stay Michael, the Archangel, defend us in battle.\n(1696.66, 1700.66)  Be our protection against the wickedness and snares of the devil.\n(1700.66, 1701.66)  May God bless you.\n(1701.66, 1702.66)  Stay Michael, the Archangel, defend us in battle.\n(1702.66, 1703.66)  Be our protection against the wickedness and snares of the devil.\n(1703.66, 1704.66)  May God bless you.\n(1704.66, 1705.66)  Stay Michael, the Archangel, defend us in battle.\n(1705.66, 1706.66)  Be our protection against the wickedness and snares of the devil.\n(1706.66, 1707.66)  Stay Michael, the Archangel, defend us in battle.\n(1707.66, 1708.66)  Be our protection against the wickedness and snares of the devil.\n(1708.66, 1709.66)  Stay Michael, the Archangel, defend us in battle.\n(1709.66, 1710.66)  Be our protection against the wickedness and snares of the devil.\n(1710.66, 1711.66)  Stay Michael, the Archangel, defend us in battle.\n(1711.66, 1712.66)  Be our protection against the wickedness and snares of the devil.\n(1712.66, 1713.66)  Stay Michael, the Archangel, defend us in battle.\n",

Jacob departed from Beersheba and proceeded toward Haran.\n(383.32, 387.88)  When he came upon a certain shrine, as the sun had already set, he stopped there for\n(387.88, 389.48)  the night.\n(389.48, 393.52)  Taking one of the stones at the shrine, he put it under his head and lay down to sleep\n(393.52, 395.56)  at that spot.\n(395.56, 397.2)  Then he had a dream.\n(397.2, 402.84)  A stairway rested on the ground with its top reaching to the heavens, and God's messengers\n(402.84, 405.12)  were going up and down on it.\n(405.12, 410.76)  And there was the Lord standing beside him and saying, I, the Lord, am the God of your\n(410.76, 414.72)  forefather Abraham and the God of Isaac.\n(414.72, 419.24)  The land on which you are lying I will give to you and your descendants.\n(419.24, 422.2)  These shall be as plentiful as the dust of the earth,\n(422.2, 425.2)  and through them you shall spread out east and west,\n(425.2, 427.16)  north and south.\n(427.16, 428.68)  In you and your descendants,\n(428.68, 431.36)  all the nations of the earth shall find blessing.\n(432.24, 433.36)  Know that I am with you.\n(433.36, 435.56)  I will protect you wherever you go\n(435.56, 438.04)  and bring you back to this land.\n(438.04, 439.12)  I will never leave you\n(439.12, 441.08)  until I have done what I promised you.\n(442.08, 445.6)  When Jacob awoke from his sleep, he exclaimed,\n(445.6, 449.44)  Truly, the Lord is in this spot, although I did not know it.\n(449.44, 451.28)  In solemn wonder, he cried out,\n(451.28, 453.8)  how awesome is this shrine!\n(453.8, 456.04)  There is nothing else but an abode of God,\n(456.04, 458.72)  and that is the gateway to heaven.\n(458.72, 461.1)  Early the next morning, Jacob took the stone\n(461.1, 463.2)  that he had put under his head,\n(463.2, 465.56)  and set it up as a memorial stone,\n(465.56, 467.88)  and poured oil on top of it.\n(467.88, 469.52)  He called the site Bethel,\n(469.52, 473.44)  whereas the former name of the town had been Moos.\n(473.44, 479.58)  Jacob, then made this vow.\n(503.0, 479.58) \n(483.74, 486.66)  and to give me enough bread to eat and clothing to wear, and I come back safe to my father's house,\n(486.66, 489.24)  the Lord shall be my God.\n(489.24, 492.06)  This stone that I have set up as a memorial stone\n(492.06, 494.06)  shall be God's abode.\n(494.06, 495.6)  This is the word of the Lord.\n(497.34, 499.38)  Responsorial Psalm,\n(499.38, 502.26)  in you my God, I place my trust.\n(505.38, 508.18)  You who dwell in the shelter of the most high,\n(508.18, 510.68)  who abide in the shadow of the Almighty,\n(510.68, 514.28)  say to the Lord, my refuge and my fortress,\n(514.28, 516.46)  my God in whom I trust.\n(519.96, 522.7)  For he will rescue you from the snare of the fowler,\n(522.7, 525.08)  from the destroying pestilence.\n(525.08, 527.08)  With his pinions he will cover you,\n(527.08, 530.0)  and under his wings you shall take refuge.\n(533.56, 536.78)  Because he clings to me, I will deliver him.\n(536.78, 540.46)  I will set him on high because he acknowledges my name.\n(540.46, 544.06)  He shall call upon me and I will answer him.\n(544.06, 546.44)  I will be with him in distress.\n(565.66, 546.44) \n(568.36, 575.36)  The Lord be with you. A reading from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew.\n(575.36, 579.9)  While Jesus was speaking, an official came forward, knelt down before him, and said,\n(579.9, 585.22)  My daughter has just died, but come lay your hand on her and she will live.\n(585.22, 588.94)  Jesus rose and followed him, and so did his disciples.\n(588.94, 594.38)  A woman suffering hemorrhages for twelve years came up behind him and touched the tassel\n(594.38, 595.82)  on his cloak.\n(595.82, 600.7)  She said to herself, If only I can touch his cloak, I shall be cured.\n(600.7, 602.82)  Jesus turned around and saw her and said,\n(602.82, 606.06)  courage daughter, your faith has saved you.\n(606.06, 609.1)  And from that hour, the woman was cured.\n(609.1, 611.42)  When Jesus arrived at the official's house\n(611.42, 613.5)  and saw the flute players and the crowd\n(613.5, 616.66)  who were making a commotion, he said, go away.\n(616.66, 618.94)  The girl is not dead, but sleeping.\n(618.94, 620.66)  And they ridiculed him.\n(620.66, 624.06)  When the crowd was put out, he came and took her by the hand.\n(624.06, 626.02)  And the little girl arose.\n(626.02, 629.18)  And news of this spread throughout all that land.\n(629.18, 630.66)  the gospel of the Lord.\n(636.38, 640.22)  Of all of the images that those who assembled the catechism\n(640.22, 643.32)  could have chose to illustrate the sacraments,\n(643.32, 645.9)  the one that they picked is a fresco\n(645.9, 650.62)  from the catacombs of St. Marcellinus and St. Peter.\n(650.62, 654.5)  And it's an image of the woman suffering from hemorrhages\n(654.5, 657.98)  for 12 years as she reaches out to touch the cloak.\n(657.98, 665.02)  And so this is the image that those who assembled the catechism put right before all of the words\n(665.02, 670.3)  that describe what the sacraments do in the church. And so if the old adage that a picture\n(670.3, 675.82)  is worth a thousand words is true, we have a lot to learn from this image and this scene that we\n(675.82, 685.1)  see in the Gospel. The woman knew if she made contact with Christ, she could be healed. And\n(685.1, 690.56)  And as we hear in the account of the Gospel, she is healed and Jesus is aware of the power\n(690.56, 695.8)  that comes through him, comes out of her, into her, through this contact.\n(695.8, 699.98)  And so what do we learn from this about the sacraments?\n(699.98, 706.48)  The sacraments continue the saving power of Jesus that he initiated during his earthly\n(706.48, 713.46)  ministry and they do this through the tangible contact we have with Christ every time we\n(713.46, 714.94)  receive him.\n(714.94, 722.3)  The same power of Jesus that healed this woman flows from him into us.\n(722.3, 728.56)  In fact, at every Mass, we touch a lot more than just the cloak of Jesus.\n(728.56, 732.78)  We receive his very body, blood, soul, and divinity.\n(732.78, 738.18)  And that's why in the month of July, priests are encouraged to celebrate votive Masses\n(738.18, 740.22)  of the most precious blood of Jesus.\n(740.22, 743.42)  the month of July is dedicated to the precious blood,\n(743.42, 746.44)  because it is from the cross,\n(746.44, 749.84)  from Jesus' pierced side that flowed out blood and water,\n(749.84, 752.46)  that we receive all of the sacraments.\n(752.46, 754.28)  And so as you come forward today,\n(754.28, 758.12)  know that you receive Christ himself,\n(758.12, 760.64)  and this has healing powers\n(760.64, 763.24)  that then brings about fruit in your life.\n(763.24, 765.68)  And so let us stand and make our petitions\n(765.68, 767.48)  known to our Heavenly Father.\n(769.12, 767.48) \n(773.48, 781.48)  We pray for Pope Leo and for Bishop Richard Henning, and for all bishops throughout the Church. May God give them the grace to be true shepherds of souls who point us to the healing and saving power of the sacraments. We pray to the Lord.\n(781.48, 786.48)  We pray for all civil leaders, governments, and elected officials throughout the world.\n(786.48, 794.48)  May they enact policies that protect the Church and give her the freedom to be herself so the Kingdom of God can be spread to every corner of the globe.\n(794.48, 796.48)  We pray to the Lord.\n(796.48, 799.02)  We pray for an increase of vocations\n(799.02, 801.3)  to the priesthood and to the religious life,\n(801.3, 803.62)  especially for members from our own parishes\n(803.62, 805.22)  and our own families.\n(805.22, 806.5)  We pray to the Lord.\n(807.66, 809.7)  And we pray for our beloved dead,\n(809.7, 812.02)  especially for Michael O'Donovan Sr.,\n(812.02, 813.82)  for whom this mass is offered,\n(813.82, 816.58)  through the mercy of God and with the help of our prayers,\n(816.58, 819.26)  may he come to see Christ face to face.\n(819.26, 820.44)  We pray to the Lord.\n(821.7, 824.54)  Heavenly Father, we make these prayers with great confidence\n(824.54, 826.86)  as we ask them through the intercession of Mary,\n(826.86, 828.82)  our morning star in gate of heaven.\n(828.82, 831.46)  And we speak them in the name of Jesus, her son,\n(831.46, 833.34)  who was Lord forever and ever.\n(854.54, 856.54)  We'll be right back.\n(914.54, 927.1)  Pray, brothers and sisters, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God the Almighty\n(927.1, 936.02)  Father.\n(936.02, 941.54)  As we offer our oblation to your majesty, O Lord, may we draw near in these mysteries\n(941.54, 946.42)  Jesus the mediator of the new covenant and celebrate anew the sprinkling of his\n(946.42, 953.92)  blood in which lies all our salvation through Christ our Lord the Lord be with\n(953.92, 962.78)  you lift up your hearts let us give thanks to the Lord our God it is truly\n(962.78, 966.54)  right and just our duty and our salvation always and everywhere to give\n(966.54, 971.22)  you thanks Lord Holy Father Almighty and eternal God for through the saving\n(971.22, 976.08)  passion of your Son, the whole world has received a heart to confess the infinite\n(976.08, 980.7)  power of your majesty, since by the wondrous power of the cross, your\n(980.7, 985.98)  judgment on the world is now revealed in the authority of Christ crucified. And so\n(985.98, 990.9)  Lord, with all the angels and saints, we too give you thanks as an exultation we\n(990.9, 997.86)  acclaim. Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts, heaven and earth are full of your\n(997.86, 1003.46)  glory, O Zana in the highest. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord,\n(1003.46, 1010.54)  O Zana in the highest. You are indeed holy, O Lord, and all you have created\n(1010.54, 1015.34)  rightly gives you praise. For through your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, by the\n(1015.34, 1019.78)  power and working of the Holy Spirit, you give life to all things and make them\n(1019.78, 1024.26)  holy. And you never cease to gather a people to yourself, so that from the\n(1024.26, 1029.32)  rising of the Sun to its setting, a pure sacrifice may be offered to your name.\n(1029.32, 1034.72)  Therefore, O Lord, we humbly implore you, by the same Spirit graciously make holy\n(1034.72, 1038.66)  these gifts we have brought to you for consecration, that they may become the\n(1038.66, 1044.2)  body and blood of your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, at whose command we\n(1044.2, 1049.8)  celebrate these mysteries. For in the night he was betrayed, he himself took\n(1049.8, 1055.0)  bread and giving you thanks he said the blessing broke the bread and gave it to\n(1055.0, 1064.28)  his disciples saying take this all of you and eat of it for this is my body\n(1064.28, 1069.0)  which will be given up for you\n(1079.8, 1091.8)  In a similar way, when supper was ended, He took the chalice, and giving you thanks, He said the blessing, and gave the chalice to His disciples, saying,\n(1091.8, 1106.8)  Take this, all of you, and drink from it, for this is the chalice of My blood, the blood of the new and eternal covenant, which will be poured out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins.\n(1106.8, 1111.8)  Do this in memory of me.\n(1125.8, 1133.8)  The mystery of faith. Save us, Savior of the world, for by your cross and resurrection you have set us free.\n(1133.8, 1138.3)  Therefore, O Lord, as we celebrate the memorial of the saving passion of your\n(1138.3, 1142.32)  Son, his wondrous resurrection and ascension into heaven, and as we look\n(1142.32, 1146.24)  forward to his second coming, we offer you in thanksgiving this holy and living\n(1146.24, 1151.12)  sacrifice. Look, we pray, upon the oblation of your church and recognizing\n(1151.12, 1154.92)  the sacrificial victim by whose death you willed to reconcile us to yourself.\n(1154.92, 1159.4)  Grant that we who are nourished by the body and blood of your Son and filled\n(1159.4, 1164.74)  with His Holy Spirit may become one body, one Spirit in Christ. May He make of us an\n(1164.74, 1169.42)  eternal offering to you, so that we may obtain an inheritance with your elect, especially\n(1169.42, 1174.4)  with the most blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God. With blessed Joseph, her spouse, with\n(1174.4, 1178.9)  your blessed apostles and glorious martyrs, and with all the saints, on whose constant\n(1178.9, 1184.18)  intercession in your presence we rely for unfailing help. May this sacrifice of our\n(1184.18, 1188.66)  reconciliation we pray, O Lord, advance the peace and salvation of all the world.\n(1188.66, 1192.34)  Be pleased to confirm in faith and charity your pilgrim church on earth\n(1192.34, 1197.38)  with your servant Leo, our Pope, and Richard, our Bishop, the order of bishops,\n(1197.38, 1202.46)  all the clergy, and the entire people you have gained for your own. Listen\n(1202.46, 1206.62)  graciously to the prayers of this family whom you have summoned before you and\n(1206.62, 1211.22)  your compassion, O merciful Father. Gather to yourself all your children scattered\n(1211.22, 1212.46)  throughout the world.\n(1212.46, 1214.7)  To our departed brothers and sisters,\n(1214.7, 1215.94)  and to all who are pleasing to you\n(1215.94, 1217.74)  at their passing from this life,\n(1217.74, 1219.68)  give kind admittance to your kingdom.\n(1219.68, 1222.6)  There we hope to enjoy forever the fullness of your glory,\n(1222.6, 1223.98)  through Christ our Lord,\n(1223.98, 1226.82)  through whom you bestow on the world all that is good.\n(1230.22, 1232.66)  Through him and with him and in him,\n(1232.66, 1234.54)  O God, almighty Father,\n(1234.54, 1236.5)  in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\n(1236.5, 1239.78)  all glory and honor is yours forever and ever.\n(1241.22, 1245.48)  At the Savior's command, informed by divine teaching,\n(1245.48, 1249.74)  we dare to say, our Father, who art in heaven,\n(1249.74, 1251.32)  hallowed be thy name.\n(1251.32, 1254.04)  Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,\n(1254.04, 1256.04)  on earth as it is in heaven.\n(1256.04, 1258.6)  Give us this day our daily bread,\n(1258.6, 1260.96)  and forgive us our trespasses,\n(1260.96, 1264.28)  as we forgive those who trespass against us,\n(1264.28, 1266.6)  and lead us not into temptation,\n(1266.6, 1268.52)  but deliver us from evil.\n(1268.52, 1271.08)  Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil.\n(1271.08, 1274.68)  Graciously grant peace in our days that by the help of your mercy\n(1274.68, 1281.88)  We may be always free from sin and safe from all distress as we await the blessed. Hope and the coming of our Savior Jesus Christ\n(1286.52, 1290.56)  Lord Jesus Christ who said to your apostles peace.

In the name of the Father\n(271.62, 278.1)  and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit the Lord be with you. Today's mass is\n(278.1, 282.86)  offered for the repose of the souls of Mary and James Francis Welch senior and\n(282.86, 287.66)  we celebrate a votive mass of the most precious blood of Jesus. My brothers and\n(287.66, 291.48)  sisters let us acknowledge our sins and so prepare ourselves to celebrate the\n(291.48, 298.68)  sacred mysteries I confess to Almighty God into you my brothers and sisters\n(298.68, 304.38)  that I have greatly sinned in my thoughts and in my words and what I have\n(304.38, 308.72)  done and what I have failed to do through my fault through my fault\n(308.72, 313.2)  through my most grievous fault therefore I ask the Blessed Mary ever\n(313.2, 318.96)  virgin all the angels and saints and you my brothers and sisters to pray for me\n(318.96, 324.04)  to the Lord our God may almighty God have mercy on us forgive us our sins and\n(324.04, 333.12)  bring us to everlasting life Lord have mercy Christ have mercy Lord have mercy\n(333.12, 340.84)  let us pray Oh God who by the precious blood of your only begotten Son have\n(340.84, 345.52)  redeemed the whole world preserve in us the work of your mercy so that ever\n(345.52, 350.84)  honoring the mystery of our salvation, we may merit to obtain its fruits. To our Lord\n(350.84, 356.08)  Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\n(356.08, 365.0)  God forever and ever.\n(365.0, 372.66)  A reading from the book of Genesis. Jacob departed from Beersheba and proceeded toward\n(372.66, 380.18)  Lord Heron, when he came upon a certain shrine, as the sun had already set, he stopped there\n(380.18, 382.26)  for the night.\n(382.26, 387.94)  Taking one of the stones at the shrine, he put it under his head and lay down to sleep\n(387.94, 390.3)  at that spot.\n(390.3, 392.38)  Then he had a dream.\n(392.38, 399.26)  A stairway rested on the ground, with its top reaching to the heavens, and God's messengers\n(399.26, 401.38)  were going up and down on it.\n(401.38, 408.38)  And there was the Lord standing beside him and saying, I, the Lord, am the God of your\n(408.9, 415.28)  forefather Abraham and the God of Isaac, the land on which you are lying, I will give to\n(415.28, 422.28)  you and your descendants. These shall be as plentiful as the dust of the earth, and through\n(422.46, 429.46)  them you shall spread out east and west, north and south. In you and your descendants there\n(431.38, 435.52)  All the nations of the earth shall find blessing.\n(435.52, 437.28)  Know that I am with you.\n(437.28, 442.86)  I will protect you wherever you go and bring you back to this land.\n(442.86, 448.32)  I will never leave you until I have done what I promised you.\"\n(448.32, 452.0)  When Jacob awoke from his sleep, he exclaimed,\n(452.0, 457.32)  Truly the Lord is in this spot, although I did not know it.\n(457.32, 462.84)  In solemn wonder he cried out, How awesome is this shrine!\n(462.84, 469.4)  This is nothing else but an abode of God, and that is the gateway to heaven.\n(469.4, 475.24)  Early the next morning Jacob took the stone that he had put under his head, set it up\n(475.24, 479.86)  as a memorial stone, and poured oil on top of it.\n(479.86, 487.3)  He called the site Bethel, whereas the former name of the town had been Lutze.\n(487.3, 490.3)  Jacob then made this vow.\n(490.3, 496.9)  If God remains with me to protect me on this journey I am making, and to give me enough\n(496.9, 504.54)  bread to eat and clothing to wear, and I come back safe to my father's house, the Lord shall\n(504.54, 511.54)  be my God. This stone that I have set up as a memorial stone shall be God's abode. The\n(512.92, 519.92)  word of the Lord. The response to the real psalm, in you my God I place my trust. You\n(526.0, 532.94)  who dwell in the shelter of the Most High, who abide in the shadow of the Almighty, say\n(532.94, 543.44)  Say to the Lord my refuge and my fortress, my God in whom I trust.\n(543.44, 549.94)  For he will rescue you from the snare of the fowler, from the destroying pestilence.\n(549.94, 560.06)  With his pinions he will cover you, and under his wings you shall take refuge.\n(560.06, 563.2)  Because he clings to me, I will deliver him.\n(563.2, 567.56)  I will set him on high because he acknowledges my name.\n(567.56, 571.44)  He shall call upon me and I will answer him.\n(571.44, 592.48)  I will be with him in distress.\n(592.48, 594.16)  The Lord be with you.\n(594.16, 601.28)  A reading from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew.\n(601.28, 606.2)  While Jesus was speaking, an official came forward and knelt down before him and said,\n(606.2, 611.54)  And my daughter has just died, but come lay your hand on her and she will live.\n(611.54, 615.4)  Jesus rose and followed him, and so did his disciples.\n(615.4, 620.38)  A woman suffering hemorrhages for twelve years came up behind him and touched the tassel\n(620.38, 621.88)  on his cloak.\n(621.88, 626.8)  She said to herself, If only I can touch his cloak, I shall be cured.\n(626.8, 632.56)  Jesus turned around and saw her and said courage daughter your faith has saved you and from\n(632.56, 635.32)  that hour the woman was cured.\n(635.32, 639.72)  When Jesus arrived at the officials house and saw the flute players in the crowd who\n(639.72, 647.32)  were making a commotion he said go away the girl is not dead but sleeping and they ridiculed\n(647.32, 648.32)  him.\n(648.32, 653.38)  When the crowd was put out he came and took her by the hand and the little girl arose\n(653.38, 656.82)  And news of this spread throughout all that land.\n(656.82, 663.7)  The Gospel of the Lord.\n(663.7, 669.06)  If you open up the Catechism of the Catholic Church and you look at the section before\n(669.06, 674.18)  part two, which is on the sacramental life, you'll see a picture that's a fresco from\n(674.18, 679.28)  the catacombs of St. Marcellinus and St. Peter from about the fourth century.\n(679.28, 687.32)  And it's an image of this scene from the gospel of the woman suffering from the hemorrhages\n(687.32, 691.3)  reaching out to touch the cloak of Jesus.\n(691.3, 696.54)  And if the old adage is true that a picture is worth a thousand words, there's a lot we\n(696.54, 699.46)  can learn about the sacraments from that photo.\n(699.46, 704.06)  And that's why those who assembled the catechism put that picture there.\n(704.06, 710.34)  Because we know from this scene that the woman believed if she just touched the cloak of\n(710.34, 716.7)  Jesus, in other words, if she made contact with Him, she could be cured.\n(716.7, 725.1)  The sacraments continue Jesus' saving work that He began on earth, and they do this through\n(725.1, 729.88)  a tangible, concrete encounter with the living God.\n(729.88, 737.66)  Every time we receive a sacrament, fruitfully, the power of Christ, the divine life, is placed\n(737.66, 740.08)  into our souls.\n(740.08, 744.28)  Today at this Mass, we are all the Syrophoenician woman.\n(744.28, 748.28)  We all come with different things that need to be cured.\n(748.28, 754.22)  We all come reaching out, just hoping to make contact with God.\n(754.22, 759.72)  We touch in the Eucharist far more than just the cloak of Jesus.\n(759.72, 763.6)  we receive his very body, blood, soul, and divinity,\n(763.6, 766.84)  this source of healing and power for all of us.\n(766.84, 770.42)  And so that's why today, throughout the month of July,\n(770.42, 773.42)  priests are encouraged to celebrate votive masses\n(773.42, 775.16)  of the precious blood.\n(775.16, 776.88)  The month of July is dedicated\n(776.88, 778.48)  to the precious blood of Jesus,\n(778.48, 782.32)  because on the cross, through his pure sight,\n(782.32, 784.54)  flow blood and water,\n(784.54, 788.52)  which is the source of all of the sacramental life.\n(788.52, 790.68)  And so what a grace it is to come forward\n(790.68, 795.16)  like this woman hemorrhaging to touch the cloak of Jesus,\n(795.16, 798.9)  because this is the divine life that cures and heals us all.\n(798.9, 801.9)  And so let us stand and make our petitions known\n(801.9, 803.28)  to our Heavenly Father.\n(805.18, 807.8)  We pray for Pope Leo and for Bishop Richard Henning\n(807.8, 809.72)  and for all bishops throughout the church.\n(809.72, 813.08)  May God give him the grace to be true shepherds of souls\n(813.08, 815.8)  who point us to the healing and transformative power\n(815.8, 816.68)  of the sacraments.\n(816.68, 817.88)  We pray to the Lord.\n(818.52, 823.2)  We pray for all civil leaders, governments, and elected officials throughout the world.\n(823.2, 828.48)  May they enact policies that protect the church and give her the freedom to be herself so\n(828.48, 831.64)  the kingdom of God can be spread to every corner of the globe.\n(831.64, 834.18)  We pray to the Lord.\n(834.18, 839.08)  We pray for an increase of vocations to the priesthood and to the religious life, especially\n(839.08, 842.6)  for members from our own parishes and our own families.\n(842.6, 848.0)  May God call many men and women to give their lives entirely to Him to help bring the sacraments\n(848.0, 855.92)  to people we pray to the Lord and we pray for our beloved dead especially for Mary and James\n(855.92, 862.56)  Francis Welch Sr. for whom this mass is offered with the help of our prayers may they come to see\n(862.56, 869.76)  Christ face to face we pray to the Lord. Heavenly Father we make these prayers with great confidence\n(869.76, 874.64)  as we ask them through the intercession of Mary Queen of the Rosary and Gate of Heaven and we speak\n(874.64, 880.0)  them in the name of Jesus her son who is Lord forever and ever.\n(964.64, 972.44)  Pray, brothers and sisters, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God, the Almighty\n(972.44, 981.86)  Father.\n(981.86, 987.68)  As we offer our oblation to your majesty, O Lord, may we draw near in these mysteries\n(987.68, 994.04)  to Jesus, the mediator of the new covenant, and celebrate anew the sprinkling of his blood,\n(994.04, 998.04)  in which lies all our salvation, through Christ our Lord.\n(999.36, 1000.54)  The Lord be with you.\n(1001.8, 1003.26)  Lift up your hearts.\n(1004.32, 1006.4)  Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.\n(1008.36, 1011.72)  It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation,\n(1011.72, 1014.16)  always and everywhere to give you thanks.\n(1014.16, 1017.0)  Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal God,\n(1017.0, 1019.58)  for through the saving passion of your Son,\n(1019.58, 1021.52)  the whole world has received a heart\n(1021.52, 1024.4)  to confess the infinite power of your majesty,\n(1024.4, 1027.04)  since by the wondrous power of the cross,\n(1027.04, 1029.36)  your judgment on the world is now revealed\n(1029.36, 1031.8)  and the authority of Christ crucified.\n(1031.8, 1034.48)  And so, Lord, with all the angels and saints,\n(1034.48, 1038.04)  we too give you thanks as an exaltation we acclaim.\n(1038.04, 1042.4)  Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts,\n(1042.4, 1045.0)  heaven and earth are full of your glory,\n(1045.0, 1047.0)  Hosanna in the highest.\n(1047.0, 1050.18)  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord,\n(1050.18, 1051.62)  Hosanna in the highest.\n(1054.38, 1056.3)  You are indeed holy, O Lord,\n(1056.3, 1058.82)  and all you have created rightly gives you praise.\n(1058.82, 1061.5)  For through your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ,\n(1061.5, 1063.98)  by the power and working of the Holy Spirit,\n(1063.98, 1066.86)  you give life to all things and make them holy,\n(1066.86, 1069.7)  and you never cease to gather a people to yourself,\n(1069.7, 1072.38)  so that from the rising of the sun to its setting,\n(1072.38, 1075.82)  a pure sacrifice may be offered to your name.\n(1075.82, 1078.66)  Therefore, O Lord, we humbly implore you,\n(1078.66, 1081.7)  by the same Spirit graciously make holy these gifts\n(1081.7, 1083.94)  we have brought to you for consecration,\n(1083.94, 1086.82)  that they may become the body and blood\n(1086.82, 1089.7)  of your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ,\n(1089.7, 1092.98)  at whose command we celebrate these mysteries.\n(1092.98, 1095.66)  For on the night he was betrayed,\n(1095.66, 1098.9)  he himself took bread, and giving you thanks,\n(1098.9, 1101.54)  he said the blessing, broke the bread,\n(1101.54, 1104.06)  and gave it to his disciples, saying,\n(1105.3, 1104.06) \n(1114.78, 1129.72)  Take this, all of you, and eat of it, for this is my body, which will be given up for you.\n(1129.72, 1135.88)  In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took the chalice, and giving you thanks, he\n(1135.88, 1141.64)  said the blessing, and gave the chalice to his disciples, saying,\n(1141.64, 1145.62)  Take this, all of you, and drink from it.\n(1145.62, 1152.08)  For this is the chalice of my blood, the blood of the new and eternal covenant, which will\n(1152.08, 1156.72)  be poured out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins.\n(1156.72, 1174.18)  Do this in memory of me.\n(1174.18, 1180.72)  The mystery of faith, save us, savior of the world, for by your cross and resurrection\n(1180.72, 1182.28)  you have set us free.\n(1182.28, 1187.88)  Therefore, O Lord, as we celebrate the memorial of the saving passion of your Son, his wondrous\n(1187.88, 1192.48)  resurrection and ascension into heaven, and as we look forward to his second coming, we\n(1192.48, 1195.48)  offer you in thanksgiving this holy and living sacrifice.\n(1195.48, 1200.92)  Look, we pray, upon the oblation of your Church, in recognizing the sacrificial victim by whose\n(1200.92, 1204.2)  death you willed to reconcile us to yourself.\n(1204.2, 1208.16)  Grant that we who are nourished by the body and blood of your Son, and filled with his\n(1208.16, 1211.92)  Holy Spirit, may become one body, one spirit in Christ.\n(1211.92, 1214.56)  that he make of us an eternal offering to you,\n(1214.56, 1217.36)  so that we may obtain an inheritance with your elect,\n(1217.36, 1219.48)  especially with the most blessed Virgin Mary,\n(1219.48, 1222.68)  Mother of God, with blessed Joseph, her spouse,\n(1222.68, 1225.16)  with your blessed apostles and glorious martyrs,\n(1225.16, 1226.64)  and with all the saints.\n(1226.64, 1229.12)  On whose constant intersection in your presence,\n(1229.12, 1231.16)  we rely for unfailing help.\n(1231.16, 1234.88)  May this sacrifice of our reconciliation, we pray, O Lord,\n(1234.88, 1237.96)  advance the peace and salvation of all the world.\n(1237.96, 1239.96)  Be pleased to confirm in faith and charity\n(1239.96, 1242.76)  your pilgrim church on earth, with your servant,\n(1242.76, 1245.56)  Leo, our pope, and Richard, our bishop,\n(1245.56, 1247.92)  the order of bishops, all the clergy,\n(1247.92, 1251.14)  and the entire people you have gained for your own.\n(1251.14, 1254.28)  Listen graciously to the prayers of this family,\n(1254.28, 1256.14)  whom you have summoned before you,\n(1256.14, 1258.56)  in your compassion and merciful father,\n(1258.56, 1260.48)  gather to yourself all your children\n(1260.48, 1262.28)  scattered throughout the world.\n(1262.28, 1264.4)  To our departed brothers and sisters,\n(1264.4, 1266.4)  and to all who are pleasing to you\n(1266.4, 1268.36)  at their passing from this life,\n(1268.36, 1270.46)  give kind admittance to your kingdom,\n(1270.46, 1273.66)  there we hope to enjoy forever the fullness of your glory,\n(1273.66, 1275.1)  through Christ our Lord,\n(1275.1, 1277.9)  through whom you bestow on the world all that is good.\n(1282.56, 1284.88)  Through him and with him and in him,\n(1284.88, 1288.88)  O God, almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\n(1288.88, 1292.62)  all glory and honor is yours forever and ever.\n(1294.22, 1298.3)  At the Savior's command, informed by divine teaching,\n(1298.3, 1304.92)  we dare to say our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom\n(1304.92, 1310.88)  come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily\n(1310.88, 1316.72)  bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against\n(1316.72, 1322.96)  us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil deliver us Lord we\n(1322.96, 1327.58)  pray from every evil graciously grant peace in our days that by the help of\n(1327.58, 1332.2)  your mercy we may be always free from sin and safe from all distress as we\n(1332.2, 1340.86)  await the blessed hope and the coming of our Savior Jesus Christ. Lord Jesus\n(1340.86, 1345.62)  Christ who said to your apostles peace I leave you my peace I give you. Look not in our\n(1345.62, 1349.82)  sins but on the faith of your church and graciously grant her peace and unity in\n(1349.82, 1354.34)  accordance with your will who live and reign forever and ever. The peace of the\n(1354.34, 1362.34)  Lord be with you always. Let us offer each other the sign of peace. Lamb of God,\n(1362.34, 1368.58)  you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us. Lamb of God, you take away\n(1368.58, 1374.3)  the sins of the world, have mercy on us. Lamb of God, you take away the sins of\n(1374.3, 1377.9)  the world, grant us peace.\n(1384.34, 1399.54)  Behold the Lamb of God. Behold Him who takes away the sins of the world. Blessed are those\n(1399.54, 1404.78)  called to the supper of the Lamb.

        "transcript": "(270.0, 276.88)  Good morning, everyone.\n(276.88, 282.0)  In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, the grace of our Lord\n(282.0, 289.02)  Jesus Christ and the love of God and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with all of you, preparing\n(289.02, 297.86)  ourselves for the Eucharist we call to mind our sins and ask the Lord's forgiveness.\n(297.86, 305.38)  Lord have mercy, Christ have mercy, Lord have mercy.\n(305.38, 312.26)  May Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us our sins, and bring us to everlasting life.\n(312.26, 316.34)  Let us pray.\n(316.34, 322.82)  Show favor, O Lord, to your servants, and mercifully increase the gifts of your grace,\n(322.82, 327.5)  made fervent in hope, faith, and charity, they may be ever watchful in keeping\n(327.5, 332.54)  your commands. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns\n(332.54, 338.46)  with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, forever and ever.\n(351.3, 338.46) \n(354.36, 359.06)  A reading from the book of Exodus. When it was reported to the king of Egypt that the people had fled, Pharaoh and his\n(359.06, 361.44)  servants changed their minds about them.\n(361.44, 365.5)  They exclaimed, what have we done?\n(365.5, 371.84)  we have released Israel from our service. So Pharaoh made his chariots ready and mustered\n(371.84, 378.9)  his soldiers. Six hundred first class chariots and all the other chariots of Egypt with warriors\n(378.9, 385.36)  on the mall. So obstinate had the Lord made Pharaoh that he pursued the children of Israel\n(385.36, 392.0)  even while they were marching away in triumph. The Egyptians then pursued them. Pharaoh's\n(392.0, 397.56)  whole army, his horses, chariots and charioteers, caught up with them as they\n(397.56, 404.16)  lay encamped by the sea at Pihaphanroth in front of Baal's Ephron. Pharaoh was\n(404.16, 408.12)  already near when the children of Israel looked up and saw that the Egyptians\n(408.12, 412.64)  were on their march in pursuit of them. In great fright they cried out to the\n(412.64, 417.84)  Lord and they complained to Moses, were there no burial places in Egypt that you\n(417.84, 422.88)  had to bring us out here to die in the desert? Why did you do this to us? Why\n(422.88, 427.08)  did you bring us out of Egypt? Did we not tell you this in Egypt when we said,\n(427.08, 433.24)  leave us alone, let us serve the Egyptians? Far better for us to be the\n(433.24, 438.68)  slaves of the Egyptians than to die in the desert. But Moses answered the people,\n(438.68, 443.64)  fear not, stand your ground and you will see the victory the Lord will win for\n(443.64, 449.88)  you today, these Egyptians whom you see today you will never see again. The Lord\n(449.88, 455.84)  himself would fight for you, you have only to keep still. Then the Lord said to\n(455.84, 461.24)  Moses, why are you crying out to me? Tell the children of Israel to go forward. And\n(461.24, 468.16)  you, lift up your staff and with hand outstretched over the sea, split the sea\n(468.16, 474.66)  in two that the children of Israel may pass through it on dry land but I will\n(474.66, 479.2)  make the Egyptians so obstinate that they will go in after them then I will\n(479.2, 485.68)  see glory through Pharaoh in all his army his chariots and charioteers the\n(485.68, 490.12)  Egyptian shall know that I am the Lord when I receive glory through Pharaoh in\n(490.12, 495.96)  his chariots and charioteers. This is the word of the Lord.\n(496.28, 504.2)  Responsorial Psalm. Let us sing to the Lord. He has covered himself in glory.\n(507.4, 511.56)  I will sing to the Lord, for he is gloriously triumphant.\n(511.56, 515.24)  Horsened chariot, he has cast into the sea.\n(515.24, 520.04)  My strength and my courage is the Lord, and he has been my Savior.\n(520.04, 527.04)  He is my God. I praise him, the God of my father. I extol him.\n(532.04, 535.04)  The Lord is a warrior. Lord is his name.\n(535.04, 539.04)  Pharaoh's chariots and army he hurled into the sea.\n(539.04, 544.04)  The elite of his officers were submerged into the Red Sea.\n(548.04, 544.04) \n(553.64, 557.16)  The flood waters covered them, they sank into the depths like a stone. Your right hand, O Lord, magnificent in power.\n(557.16, 585.48)  Your right hand, O Lord, has shattered the enemy.\n(585.48, 596.34)  the Lord be with you a reading from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew some of\n(596.34, 603.5)  the scribes and Pharisees said to Jesus teacher we wish to see a sign from you\n(603.5, 610.86)  he said to them in reply an evil and unfaithful generation generation seeks a\n(610.86, 618.02)  sign, but no sign will be given it except the sign of Jonah the prophet. Just as\n(618.02, 623.5)  Jonah was in the belly of the whale three days and three nights, so will the\n(623.5, 629.72)  Son of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights. At the\n(629.72, 635.42)  judgment the men of Nineveh will arise with this generation and condemn it\n(635.42, 640.94)  because they repented at the preaching of Jonah. And there is something greater\n(640.94, 647.7)  than Jonah here. At the judgment the Queen of the South will arise with this\n(647.7, 653.06)  generation and condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear\n(653.06, 660.22)  the wisdom of Solomon. And there is something greater than Solomon here.\n(660.22, 663.78)  The Gospel of the Lord.\n(665.42, 676.42)  In today's Gospel, some people came to Jesus and said to Him, show us a sign.\n(676.42, 682.18)  They wanted proof that He's really from God.\n(682.18, 688.82)  But their request doesn't come from faith, it comes from really resistance.\n(688.82, 697.58)  already seen healings and miracles and exorcisms, yet they remain unmoved. What\n(697.58, 704.74)  more could they possibly need? But Jesus says you've already seen enough. He\n(704.74, 708.9)  doesn't mean he won't do anything, but that the most important sign is still\n(708.9, 714.26)  coming, his death and resurrection. And that's the sign of Jonah that he speaks\n(714.26, 719.5)  Like Jonah was in the belly of the fish for three days, Jesus would be in the\n(719.5, 725.96)  tomb and then rise again for three days and three nights. Jesus then says\n(725.96, 731.54)  something, the people of Nineveh who weren't even part of God's chosen people\n(731.54, 738.3)  listened to Jonah and changed their lives. And the Queen of Sheba traveled\n(738.3, 744.22)  far just to hear Solomon's wisdom, but now he says someone greater than Jonah\n(744.22, 752.8)  greater than Solomon is right here and many still won't believe. So what about\n(752.8, 761.66)  us? We may sometimes say to God the same thing. Show me a sign. Show me a sign\n(761.66, 770.44)  especially when life is hard. We sometimes ask for signs too, maybe a\n(770.44, 776.44)  dramatic answer to a prayer, a clear direction in our life, some proof that\n(776.44, 786.28)  God is even there. But Jesus is reminding us too today, you already have the sign,\n(786.28, 796.04)  the Lord Jesus. We see him in the gospel, we experience him in the Eucharist, we\n(796.04, 799.84)  We experience Him in the love of others.\n(799.84, 805.56)  If we keep waiting for something big and flashy, we might miss the quiet way that the Lord\n(805.56, 809.1)  already speaks to our hearts.\n(809.1, 816.24)  And that question then becomes, is not whether God is speaking, but whether we are listening.\n(816.24, 821.88)  So maybe we can think about that today, and not wait for more signs.\n(821.88, 827.28)  Let us respond today with repentance like Nineveh and with the desire for wisdom like\n(827.28, 829.12)  the Queen of Sheba.\n(829.12, 831.96)  Christ is here.\n(831.96, 834.6)  He is more than enough.\n(834.6, 842.3)  Let's open our eyes and ears and hearts and say, Jesus, I do believe you are here and\n(842.3, 845.3)  I want to follow you.\n(845.3, 851.74)  Let us pray.\n(851.74, 857.78)  We offer our prayers to God the Father, trusting that He always provides.\n(857.78, 862.66)  That all members of the Church may grow in our trust of God through His grace and mercy,\n(862.66, 866.1)  we pray to the Lord.\n(866.1, 870.82)  That leaders of all nations and peoples may be blessed with the compassion of Christ in\n(870.82, 876.4)  serving their people, we pray to the Lord.\n(876.4, 882.48)  That those who have turned from God may receive from him the grace of conversion, we pray\n(882.48, 886.6)  to the Lord.\n(886.6, 891.96)  For all the sick, those in hospital or nursing home, those undergoing surgery or treatment\n(891.96, 898.9)  that God's healing presence may be with them, we pray to the Lord.\n(898.9, 904.48)  That all who have died awaiting the peace of Christ may enter into the light of eternal\n(904.48, 911.16)  life we pray to the Lord. Heavenly Father hear the prayers we offer you for\n(911.16, 916.96)  the sake of the world and we ask our prayers through Christ our Lord.\n(934.48, 950.56)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through your goodness we have received\n(950.56, 954.68)  the bread we offer you, fruit of the earth and work of human hands.\n(954.68, 959.24)  It will become for us the bread of life.\n(959.24, 963.56)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through your goodness we have received\n(963.56, 969.76)  the wine we offer you, fruit of the vine and work of human hands, it will become our spiritual\n(969.76, 984.96)  drink.\n(984.96, 990.56)  Pray brothers and sisters that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God the almighty\n(990.56, 1003.88)  Father, except oh Lord we pray the offerings which we bring from the\n(1003.88, 1009.2)  abundance of your gifts that through the powerful working of your grace these\n(1009.2, 1014.76)  most sacred mysteries may sanctify our present way of life and lead us to\n(1014.76, 1024.12)  eternal gladness through Christ our Lord. The Lord be with you. Lift up your hearts.\n(1024.12, 1031.42)  Let us give thanks to the Lord our God. It is truly right and just, our duty and our\n(1031.42, 1037.88)  salvation always and everywhere to give you thanks, Lord, holy Father, almighty and eternal\n(1037.88, 1044.64)  God. For in goodness you created man and when he was justly condemned, in mercy\n(1044.64, 1050.26)  you redeemed him through Christ our Lord. Through him the angels praise your\n(1050.26, 1055.7)  majesty, may our voices now we pray join with theirs in humble praise as we\n(1055.7, 1063.44)  acclaim. Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts, heaven and earth are full of your\n(1063.44, 1069.4)  glory, Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord,\n(1069.4, 1077.8)  Hosanna in the highest. You are indeed holy, O Lord, the fount of all holiness.\n(1077.8, 1083.24)  Make holy therefore these gifts, we pray, by sending down your Spirit upon them\n(1083.24, 1088.16)  like the dewfall, so that they may become for us the body and blood of our Lord\n(1088.16, 1094.84)  Jesus Christ. At the time he was betrayed and entered willingly into his passion,\n(1094.84, 1101.08)  he took bread and giving thanks broke it and gave it to his disciples saying take\n(1101.08, 1107.24)  this all of you and eat of it for this is my body which will be given up for\n(1107.24, 1120.64)  you. In a similar way when supper was ended he took the chalice and once more\n(1120.64, 1125.64)  giving thanks he gave it to his disciples saying take this all of you and\n(1125.64, 1130.34)  drink from it for this is the chalice of my blood the blood of the new and\n(1130.34, 1134.52)  eternal covenant which will be poured out for you and for many for the\n(1134.52, 1140.48)  forgiveness of sins. Do this in memory of me.\n(1146.36, 1152.92)  The mystery of faith. We proclaim your death, O Lord, and profess your\n(1152.92, 1158.52)  resurrection until you come again. Therefore, as we celebrate the memorial\n(1158.52, 1162.88)  of his death and resurrection, we offer you, Lord, the bread of life and the\n(1162.88, 1168.12)  chalice of salvation, giving thanks that you have held us worthy to be in your\n(1168.12, 1173.72)  presence and minister to you. Humbly we pray that partaking of the body and\n(1173.72, 1179.4)  blood of Christ we may be gathered into one by the Holy Spirit. Remember Lord\n(1179.4, 1183.8)  your church spread throughout the world and bring her to the fullness of charity\n(1183.8, 1190.02)  together with Leo our Pope and Richard our Bishop and all the clergy. Remember\n(1190.02, 1193.92)  also our brothers and sisters who have fallen asleep in the hope of the\n(1193.92, 1199.5)  resurrection, and all who have died in your mercy, welcome them into the light\n(1199.5, 1205.14)  of your face. Have mercy on us all, we pray, that with the Blessed Virgin Mary,\n(1205.14, 1210.58)  Mother of God, Saint Joseph, her spouse, with the Blessed Apostles, Saint Bridget,\n(1210.58, 1214.7)  Saint Augustine, and all the saints who have pleased you throughout the ages,\n(1214.7, 1220.54)  that we may merit to be co-heirs to eternal life and may praise and glorify\n(1220.54, 1227.54)  you through your Son Jesus Christ. Through him and with him and in him, O\n(1227.54, 1232.74)  God Almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all glory and honor is yours\n(1232.74, 1242.3)  forever and ever. At the Savior's command and formed by divine teaching we dare to\n(1242.3, 1249.18)  pray now, Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come,\n(1249.18, 1255.86)  thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread\n(1255.86, 1261.98)  and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us,\n(1261.98, 1268.82)  and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Deliver us, Lord, we\n(1268.82, 1273.86)  pray from every evil, graciously grant peace in our days, that by the help of\n(1273.86, 1279.56)  your mercy we may be always free from sin and safe from all distress, as we\n(1279.56, 1284.96)  await the blessed hope in the coming of our Savior Jesus Christ, the kingdom, the\n(1284.96, 1288.0)  power, and the glory are yours now and forever.\n(1288.0, 1293.4)  Lord Jesus Christ who said to your apostles, peace I leave you, my peace I\n(1293.4, 1298.58)  give you, look not now on our sins but on the faith of your church and graciously\n(1298.58, 1304.58)  grant your peace and unity in accordance with your will, who live and reign forever and ever.\n(1305.3, 1312.1)  The peace of the Lord be with you always. Let's offer each other some sign of Christ's peace.\n(1320.02, 1328.02)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.

Behold the Lamb of God, behold him who takes away the sins\n(1342.54, 1348.18)  of the world. Blessed are those called to the Supper of the Lamb. Lord, I am not\n(1348.18, 1353.02)  worthy that you should enter under my roof, but only say the word and my soul\n(1353.02, 1355.98)  shall be healed.\n(1477.02, 1505.02)  So, thank you very much for your attention and we'll see you in the next session.\n(1564.02, 1581.74)  Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.\n(1581.74, 1587.0)  Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.\n(1587.0, 1593.3)  Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death.\n(1593.3, 1600.66)  us pray.

Lord have mercy. Christ have mercy.\n(279.98, 287.22)  Lord have mercy. May Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us our sins, and\n(287.22, 293.06)  bring us to everlasting life. Let us pray.\n(293.22, 299.1)  Show favor O Lord to your servants and mercifully increase the gifts of your\n(299.1, 305.38)  grace that made fervent in hope faith and charity they may be ever watchful in\n(305.38, 310.82)  keeping your commands through our Lord Jesus Christ your son who lives and\n(310.82, 313.76)  and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\n(313.76, 316.02)  God forever and ever.\n(327.12, 330.52)  A reading from the book of Exodus.\n(330.52, 333.36)  When it was reported to the king of Egypt\n(333.36, 335.76)  that the people had fled,\n(335.76, 339.76)  Pharaoh and his servants changed their minds about them.\n(339.76, 343.42)  They exclaimed, what have we done, why?\n(343.42, 347.1)  We have released Israel from our service.\n(347.1, 354.74)  So Pharaoh made his chariots ready and mustered his soldiers, 600 first-class chariots and\n(354.74, 360.24)  all the other chariots of Egypt, with warriors on them all.\n(360.24, 366.68)  So obstinate had the Lord made Pharaoh that he pursued the children of Israel even while\n(366.68, 370.16)  while they were marching away in triumph.\n(370.16, 378.16)  The Egyptians then pursued them, Pharaoh's whole army, his horses, chariots, charioteers,\n(378.16, 386.28)  caught up with them as they lay encamped by the sea at Pi-Hiroth in front of Baal-Zephon.\n(386.28, 391.12)  Pharaoh was already near when the children of Israel looked up and saw that the Egyptians\n(391.12, 394.2)  were on the march in pursuit of them.\n(394.2, 400.62)  In great fright they cried out to the Lord, and they complained to Moses, Were there no\n(400.62, 406.7)  burial places in Egypt that you had to bring us out here to die in the desert?\n(406.7, 409.02)  Why did you do this to us?\n(409.02, 411.82)  Why did you bring us out of Egypt?\n(411.82, 418.94)  Did we not tell you this in Egypt when we said, Leave us alone, let us serve the Egyptians?\n(418.94, 425.82)  Far better for us to be slaves of the Egyptians than to die in the desert.\n(425.82, 432.86)  But Moses answered the people, Fear not, stand your ground, and you will see the victory\n(432.86, 436.3)  the Lord will win for you today.\n(436.3, 441.16)  These Egyptians whom you see today you will never see again.\n(441.16, 444.38)  The Lord himself will fight for you.\n(444.38, 447.98)  You have only to keep still.\n(447.98, 453.06)  Then the Lord said to Moses, Why are you crying out to me?\n(453.06, 461.7)  Tell the children of Israel to go forward, and you, lift up your staff, and with hand\n(461.7, 469.06)  outstretched over the sea, split the sea in two, that the children of Israel may pass\n(469.06, 472.34)  through it on dry land.\n(472.34, 477.22)  But I will make the Egyptians so obstinate that they will go in after them.\n(477.22, 484.82)  And I will receive glory through Pharaoh and all his army, his chariots and charioteers.\n(484.82, 491.14)  The Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord when I receive glory through Pharaoh and his\n(491.14, 494.34)  chariots and charioteers.\n(494.34, 498.14)  The Word of the Lord.\n(498.14, 500.52)  The Responsorial Psalm.\n(500.52, 501.98)  Let us sing to the Lord.\n(501.98, 505.62)  He has covered himself in glory.\n(505.62, 513.34)  I will sing to the Lord, for he is gloriously triumphant.\n(513.34, 517.78)  Horse and chariot he has cast into the sea.\n(517.78, 523.36)  My strength and my courage is the Lord, and he has been my Savior.\n(523.36, 526.12)  He is my God, I praise him.\n(526.12, 528.7)  The God of my Father, I extol him.\n(528.7, 542.9)  The Lord is a warrior, Lord is his name, pharaohs, chariots, and army he hurled into the sea.\n(542.9, 552.04)  The elite of his officers were submerged in the Red Sea.\n(552.04, 558.18)  The flood waters covered them, they sank into the depths like a stone.\n(558.18, 565.54)  Your right hand, O Lord, magnificent in power, your right hand, O Lord, has shattered the\n(565.54, 566.54)  enemy.\n(566.54, 571.54)  Let us get to the Lord and get covered in the sound of the word.\n(591.54, 593.54)  The Lord be with you.\n(593.54, 594.54)  And with your spirit.\n(594.54, 602.78)  reading from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew. Some of the scribes and\n(602.78, 611.02)  Pharisees said to Jesus, teacher we wish to see a sign from you. He said to them\n(611.02, 619.22)  in reply, an evil and unfaithful generation seeks a sign but no sign will\n(619.22, 623.54)  be given it except the sign of Jonah the prophet.\n(623.54, 629.12)  Just as Jonah was in the belly of the whale three days and three nights, so will the Son\n(629.12, 634.7)  of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.\n(634.7, 639.9)  At the judgment the men of Nineveh will arise with this generation and condemn it because\n(639.9, 647.9)  they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and there is something greater than Jonah here.\n(647.9, 654.32)  At the judgment the Queen of the South will arise with this generation and condemn it,\n(654.32, 659.38)  because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and there is\n(659.38, 663.32)  something greater than Solomon here.\"\n(663.32, 672.84)  The Gospel of the Lord.\n(672.84, 679.84)  In today's Gospel, some people come to Jesus and say show us a sign.\n(679.84, 685.84)  They want proof that He's really from God.\n(685.84, 688.84)  But their request doesn't come from their faith.\n(688.84, 691.84)  It comes from resistance.\n(691.84, 698.84)  They already have seen healings and miracles and exorcisms,\n(698.84, 701.84)  yet they remain unmoved.\n(701.84, 705.84)  What more could they possibly need?\n(705.84, 709.84)  But Jesus says to them, you have already seen enough.\n(709.84, 715.84)  And He doesn't mean He won't do anything but that the most important sign is still coming,\n(715.84, 718.84)  His death and resurrection.\n(718.84, 720.84)  That's the sign of Jonah.\n(720.84, 723.84)  Like Jonah was in the belly of the fish for three days,\n(723.84, 727.84)  Jesus would be in the tomb and then rise again.\n(727.84, 730.84)  And then Jesus says something surprising.\n(730.84, 738.22)  The people of Nineveh, who weren't even part of God's chosen people, listened to Jonah\n(738.22, 741.16)  and changed their lives.\n(741.16, 747.08)  And the Queen of Sheba traveled far just to hear Solomon's wisdom.\n(747.08, 752.58)  But now someone greater than Jonah, greater than Solomon, is right here.\n(752.58, 756.9)  And many still won't believe.\n(756.9, 759.06)  So what about us?\n(759.06, 766.1)  We may sometimes say, God, show me a sign.\n(766.1, 771.06)  Show me a sign, especially when life is hard.\n(771.06, 778.42)  We sometimes ask for signs too, a dramatic answer to a prayer, a clear direction in our\n(778.42, 785.02)  life, some proof that God is there.\n(785.02, 790.02)  But Jesus is reminding us, just as He did 2,000 years ago,\n(791.58, 796.58)  you already have the sign, the Lord Jesus.\n(798.68, 801.76)  We see Him in the gospel.\n(801.76, 806.76)  We see Him and experience Him in the Eucharist today.\n(808.2, 811.12)  We experience Him in the love of others.\n(812.48, 811.12) \n(815.58, 818.8)  If we keep waiting for something big and flashy we might miss the quiet way that God\n(818.8, 824.86)  is already speaking to our hearts and the question then becomes is not whether\n(824.86, 826.14)  God is speaking\n(826.14, 833.14)  but whether we are listening. So today let's not wait for more signs.\n(833.14, 836.62)  Let us respond today with\n(836.62, 841.96)  repentance like Nineveh, and with the desire for wisdom like the Queen of\n(841.96, 851.62)  Sheba, Christ is already here. He is more than enough. We open our hearts, our ears,\n(851.62, 863.18)  and our eyes, and we say, Jesus, I believe you are here, and I want to follow you.\n(865.02, 863.18) \n(869.38, 875.36)  Let us pray. Let us offer our prayers to God, O Father, trusting that He always provides.\n(875.36, 881.42)  That all members of the Church may grow in our trust of God through His grace and mercy,\n(881.42, 884.8)  we pray to the Lord.\n(884.8, 889.86)  That the leaders of nations and peoples may be blessed with the compassion of Christ in\n(889.86, 897.36)  serving their people we pray to the Lord that those who have turned from God may\n(897.36, 904.74)  receive from him the grace of conversion we pray to the Lord for all the sick\n(904.74, 910.02)  those in hospital or nursing home those undergoing surgery or treatment today\n(910.02, 917.7)  that God's healing presence may be with them we pray to the Lord for all who\n(917.7, 921.18)  who have died, and today we remember Patrick O'Malley\n(921.18, 923.5)  for whom this mass is offered.\n(923.5, 926.36)  May they enter into the light of eternal life,\n(926.36, 928.18)  we pray to the Lord.\n(929.92, 932.22)  Heavenly Father, hear the prayers we offer you\n(932.22, 933.9)  for the sake of the world.\n(933.9, 936.82)  We ask them through Christ our Lord.\n(947.7, 974.54)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through your goodness we have received\n(974.54, 976.1)  the bread we offer you.\n(976.1, 983.76)  of the earth and work of human hands, it will become for us the bread of life.\n(983.76, 987.9)  Blessed are you, Lord God of all creation, for through your goodness we have received\n(987.9, 993.5)  the wine we offer you, fruit of the vine and work of human hands, it will become our spiritual\n(993.5, 994.02)  drink.\n(1006.1, 1016.54)  Pray, brothers and sisters, that my sacrifice and yours may become acceptable to God the\n(1016.54, 1027.42)  Almighty Father.\n(1027.42, 1032.82)  Accept, O Lord, we pray, the offerings which we bring from the abundance of your gifts,\n(1032.82, 1038.18)  That through the powerful working of your grace, these most sacred mysteries may sanctify\n(1038.18, 1044.86)  our present way of life and lead us to eternal gladness through Christ our Lord.\n(1044.86, 1047.46)  The Lord be with you.\n(1047.46, 1050.18)  Lift up your hearts.\n(1050.18, 1054.3)  Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.\n(1054.3, 1059.82)  It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, always and everywhere to give you\n(1059.82, 1066.34)  thanks Lord Holy Father almighty and eternal God for in goodness you created\n(1066.34, 1071.22)  man and when he was justly condemned in mercy you redeemed him through Christ\n(1071.22, 1078.14)  our Lord through him the angels praise your majesty may our voices we pray join\n(1078.14, 1085.34)  with theirs in humble praise as we acclaim holy holy holy Lord God of\n(1085.34, 1091.94)  hosts heaven and earth are full of your glory hosanna in the highest blessed is\n(1091.94, 1099.46)  he who comes in the name of the Lord hosanna in the highest you are indeed\n(1099.46, 1104.54)  holy o Lord the fount of all holiness make holy therefore these gifts we pray\n(1104.54, 1109.78)  by sending down your spirit upon them like the dewfall so that they may become\n(1109.78, 1115.74)  come for us the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ at the time he was\n(1115.74, 1121.22)  betrayed and entered willingly into his passion he took bread and giving thanks\n(1121.22, 1127.02)  broke it and gave it to his disciples saying take this all of you and eat of\n(1127.02, 1133.38)  it but this is my body which will be given up for you\n(1139.78, 1146.14)  In a similar way, when supper was ended, He took the chalice, and once more, giving thanks,\n(1146.14, 1151.88)  He gave it to His disciples, saying, Take this, all of you, and drink from it, for this\n(1151.88, 1157.3)  is the chalice of My blood, the blood of the new and eternal covenant, which will be poured\n(1157.3, 1161.1)  out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins.\n(1161.1, 1163.98)  Do this in memory of Me.\n(1163.98, 1178.6)  the mystery of faith we proclaim your death o Lord and profess your\n(1178.6, 1184.28)  resurrection until you come again therefore as we celebrate the memorial\n(1184.28, 1188.1)  of his death and resurrection we offer you Lord the bread of life and the\n(1188.1, 1193.26)  chalice of salvation giving thanks that you have held us worthy to be in your\n(1193.26, 1196.18)  of presence and minister to you.\n(1196.18, 1198.66)  Humbly we pray that partaking of the body\n(1198.66, 1202.1)  and blood of Christ, we may be gathered together\n(1202.1, 1204.06)  by the Holy Spirit.\n(1204.06, 1207.1)  Remember, Lord, your church spread throughout the world\n(1207.1, 1209.98)  and bring her to the fullness of charity,\n(1209.98, 1213.06)  together with Leo our Pope and Richard our Bishop\n(1213.06, 1215.14)  and all the clergy.\n(1215.14, 1217.34)  Remember also our brothers and sisters\n(1217.34, 1221.1)  who have fallen asleep in the hope of the resurrection\n(1221.1, 1223.9)  and all who have died in your mercy,\n(1223.9, 1227.14)  welcome them into the light of your face.\n(1227.14, 1229.18)  And have mercy on us all, we pray,\n(1229.18, 1231.94)  that with the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God,\n(1231.94, 1236.14)  Saint Joseph, her spouse, with the blessed apostles,\n(1236.14, 1238.58)  Saint Bridget, Saint Augustine, and all the saints\n(1238.58, 1241.38)  who have pleased you throughout the ages,\n(1241.38, 1244.7)  that we may merit to be co-heirs to eternal life\n(1244.7, 1246.58)  and may praise and glorify you\n(1246.58, 1249.02)  through your Son, Jesus Christ.\n(1250.82, 1249.02) \n(1256.02, 1262.02)  Through Him and with Him and in Him, O God, Almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, all glory and honor is Yours, forever and ever.\n(1262.02, 1269.02)  At the Savior's command and formed by divine teaching, we dare to pray now.\n(1269.02, 1274.02)  Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name.\n(1274.02, 1279.02)  Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.\n(1279.02, 1284.02)  Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses,\n(1284.02, 1288.02)  as we forgive those who trespass against us,\n(1288.02, 1293.02)  and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.\n(1293.02, 1296.02)  Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil.\n(1296.02, 1300.02)  Graciously grant peace in our days, that by the help of Your mercy\n(1300.02, 1304.02)  we may be always free from sin and safe from all distress\n(1304.02, 1309.02)  as we await the blessed hope in the coming of our Savior Jesus Christ.\n(1309.02, 1314.02)  For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and forever.\n(1314.02, 1316.02)  Lord Jesus Christ, you said to your apostles,\n(1316.02, 1319.02)  Peace I leave you, my peace I give you.\n(1319.02, 1322.02)  Look not now on our sins, but on the faith of your Church,\n(1322.02, 1327.02)  and graciously grant her peace and unity in accordance with your will,\n(1327.02, 1330.16)  who live and reign forever and ever.\n(1330.16, 1333.76)  The peace of the Lord be with you always.\n(1333.76, 1337.0)  Let's offer each other some sign of Christ's peace.\n(1356.48, 1337.0) \n(1362.2, 1365.72)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us. Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world.\n(1365.72, 1367.64)  Have mercy on us.\n(1367.64, 1371.36)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world.\n(1371.36, 1372.92)  Grant us peace.\n(1377.06, 1379.2)  Behold the Lamb of God.\n(1379.2, 1382.96)  Behold him who takes away the sins of the world.\n(1382.96, 1386.72)  Happy are we who are called to the supper of the Lamb.\n(1386.72, 1390.56)  Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof,\n(1390.56, 1393.92)  but only say the word and my soul shall be healed.\n(1420.56, 1422.56)  you\n(1570.56, 1595.52)  Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.\n(1595.52, 1600.4)  Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.\n(1600.4, 1606.36)  Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death.\n(1606.36, 1607.36)  Amen.\n(1607.36, 1611.84)  Let us pray.\n(1611.84, 1616.66)  Graciously be present to your people, we pray, O Lord, and lead those you have imbued with\n(1616.66, 1621.76)  heavenly mysteries to pass from former ways to newness of life.\n(1621.76, 1625.16)  We ask this through Christ our Lord.\n(1625.16, 1627.54)  The Lord be with you.\n(1627.54, 1629.42)  May Almighty God bless you, the Father.\n",

But I cannot flee to the hills to keep\n(385.66, 392.38)  the disaster from overtaking me, so I shall die. Look, this town ahead is near\n(392.38, 398.66)  enough to escape. It's only a small place. Let me flee there. It's a small place, is\n(398.66, 405.34)  it not, that my life may be saved. Well then, he replied, I will also grant you\n(405.34, 410.98)  you the favor you are now asked.\n(411.48, 415.48)  I will not overthrow the town you speak of, hurry, escape there.\n(415.48, 418.48)  I cannot do anything until you arrive there, that is why the town is called Zor.\"\n(418.48, 423.48)  The sun was just rising over the earth as Lot arrived in Zor.\n(423.48, 429.48)  At the same time, the Lord rained down selfless fire upon Sodom and Gerama,\n(429.48, 433.48)  with the Lord out of heaven.\n(433.48, 438.72)  These were the cities in the whole plain together with the inhabitants of the cities in the\n(438.72, 440.92)  produce of the soil.\n(440.92, 446.22)  But Lot's wife looked back and she was turned into a pillar of salt.\n(446.22, 452.68)  Early the next morning, Abraham went to the place where he had stood in the Lord's presence.\n(452.68, 457.84)  He looked down towards Sodom and Gomorrah in the whole region of the plain.\n(457.84, 464.68)  He saw a dense smoke over the land, rising like fumes from the furnace.\n(464.68, 470.9)  Thus it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, He was mindful of Abraham\n(470.9, 477.2)  by sending Lot away from the upheaval by which God overthrew the cities where Lot had been\n(477.2, 478.2)  living.\n(478.2, 479.2)  The word of the Lord.\n(479.2, 482.68)  Thanks be to God.\n(482.68, 487.78)  The response to a real psalm.\n(487.78, 490.88)  The Lord, your mercy is before my eyes.\n(490.88, 493.28)  Search me, O Lord, and try me.\n(493.28, 495.66)  Test my soul and my heart.\n(495.66, 498.86)  For your mercy is before my eyes,\n(498.86, 501.12)  and I walk in your truth.\n(501.12, 504.46)  The Lord, your mercy is before my eyes.\n(504.46, 507.4)  Gather not my soul with those of sinners,\n(507.4, 511.6)  nor with men of blood my life.\n(511.6, 517.62)  their hands are crimes, and their right hands are full of bribes. The Lord of mercy is\n(517.62, 525.4)  before my eyes. But I walk in integrity, redeem me and have mercy on me. My foot\n(525.4, 531.64)  stands on level ground, in the assemblies I will bless the Lord. The Lord your mercy\n(531.64, 534.72)  is before my eyes.\n(541.6, 554.28)  The Lord be with you, reading from the Holy Gospel according to Matthew.\n(554.28, 558.12)  As Jesus got into the boat, his disciples followed him.\n(558.12, 563.74)  Suddenly a violent storm came up on the sea, so that the boat was being swamped by waves,\n(563.74, 565.54)  but he was asleep.\n(565.54, 570.24)  They came and woke him, saying, Lord, save us, we are perishing.\n(570.24, 574.92)  He said to them, Why are you so terrified, O you of little faith?\n(574.92, 580.6)  That he put up, rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.\n(580.6, 586.58)  The men were amazed and said, What sort of man is this, whom even the winds and the sea\n(586.58, 588.46)  obey?\n(588.46, 590.2)  The Gospel of the Lord.\n(590.2, 594.34)  Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ.\n(594.34, 598.44)  This morning our hearts are open to the gift of God's divine grace.\n(598.44, 604.08)  We're beginning to see in the Gospel readings, turn my mic off, they said turn the mic that\n(604.08, 605.96)  you hold off when you're preaching.\n(605.96, 609.32)  And I intend to preach about 20 minutes this morning, no I'm not going to do that, I have\n(609.32, 610.44)  mass again.\n(610.44, 614.32)  But I think briefly, first of all, we know the sea.\n(614.32, 619.88)  I lived here for 12 years, we saw some raging storms along the beach and so you know what\n(619.88, 620.88)  the sea is like.\n(620.88, 625.56)  Or maybe you've taken a cruise, one of those Bermuda cruises, I haven't done that but I\n(625.56, 629.96)  I had been to Greece and I remember they said oh it's usually really calm and then a storm\n(629.96, 630.96)  came.\n(630.96, 633.28)  Oh my God, people were so sick.\n(633.28, 634.9)  The waves were so big.\n(634.9, 639.28)  So we know the terrifying strength of the wind and the sea.\n(639.28, 643.46)  And of course we don't know how treacherous the storm was that they were experiencing\n(643.46, 644.76)  the waves.\n(644.76, 650.64)  But the thing that we want to focus on this morning is Jesus is human.\n(650.64, 655.48)  But now the disciples are beginning to see his divine grace.\n(655.48, 662.2)  that's the opening of a whole new journey. What makes him so special? What is it that's in him?\n(662.2, 667.4)  They say that they were awakened. That's what baptism is. If you've been to a baptism,\n(667.4, 672.76)  I know you've been to many, when we bless the new infant and we pour the water on their forehead,\n(672.76, 677.24)  and I always, even as an older priest, I try to avoid their eyes because as soon as it gets\n(677.24, 682.76)  in their eyes, they scream. So we have their gentle head and we pour the water over their\n(682.76, 688.8)  forehead. And the baby will go like this. That's a symbol of awakening to God's\n(688.8, 695.56)  grace. So the water in the awakened is something to come, a new baptism. Finally,\n(695.56, 700.0)  maybe you're here for yourself every morning to pray, which is you should be,\n(700.0, 702.64)  but maybe you're here because you're praying for something in your life that\n(702.64, 707.24)  you, you know, wish you could be part of to change in a person's life. And then\n(707.24, 711.08)  you know so often when you're really in the presence of Christ like today and\n(711.08, 713.12)  You are the divine grace.\n(713.12, 715.76)  You might be someone today that will say to you,\n(715.76, 718.14)  gee, yesterday you were so upset about,\n(718.14, 719.46)  you just seem different.\n(720.58, 722.16)  You know why?\n(722.16, 723.72)  You're here.\n(723.72, 726.32)  You're gonna receive the true presence of Christ.\n(726.32, 728.74)  Whatever it is in your heart that you're praying for,\n(728.74, 732.24)  God is gonna awaken your love to that invitation.\n(732.24, 734.84)  So let us continue to be awakened.\n(734.84, 736.98)  Let us look at the truth of God's grace\n(736.98, 738.64)  that he tells us today.\n(738.64, 741.3)  but look at the mystery of the spirit\n(741.3, 744.62)  that feeds us to open our eyes to God's healing grace.\n(744.62, 746.58)  Let us stand for our prayer of the faithful.\n(746.58, 748.6)  Let us pray for all of you gathered here this morning\n(748.6, 750.74)  for your intentions, we pray to the Lord.\n(751.72, 753.62)  Let us pray for the divine grace\n(753.62, 755.42)  that is ours in our human heart,\n(755.42, 757.96)  for the gift of baptism, we pray to the Lord.\n(759.0, 760.94)  We pray for those that are called\n(760.94, 763.42)  to help us calm the storms in our life,\n(763.42, 767.04)  your own faith and family and doctors and professionals\n(767.04, 769.64)  and all those that work for our communities,\n(769.64, 770.96)  we pray to the Lord.\n(771.92, 774.76)  We pray for our Holy Father and his new journey.\n(774.76, 777.12)  Remember every day is a new day for him,\n(777.12, 779.98)  so he's going through that orientation as the Pope.\n(779.98, 782.2)  For all the things that he's carrying in his heart,\n(782.2, 783.48)  we pray to the Lord.\n(784.64, 786.88)  For your wonderful parishes of St. Bridget,\n(786.88, 788.88)  St. Augustine, in holy name,\n(788.88, 790.72)  we exhume your gate of heaven,\n(790.72, 791.96)  we pray to the Lord.\n(792.92, 795.36)  Loving God, we open our hearts to your love.\n(795.36, 797.6)  listen to our prayers this day, we pray,\n(797.6, 799.62)  through Christ our Lord, amen.\n(799.62, 800.46)  Please be seated.\n(855.36, 879.36)  Pray, my brothers and sisters, that this sacrifice may be acceptable to God the almighty Father.\n(879.36, 884.92)  O God, who graciously accomplished the effects of your mysteries, we pray that the deeds\n(884.92, 891.16)  by which we serve you may be worthy of these sacred gifts through Christ our Lord. Amen.\n(891.16, 897.16)  My friends, the Lord be with you. Lift up your hearts. Let us give thanks to the Lord\n(897.16, 903.92)  our God. He is truly right in just our duty and our salvation. Always and everywhere to\n(903.92, 909.04)  give you thanks, Father most holy, through your beloved Son Jesus Christ, your Word through\n(909.04, 913.92)  whom you made all things, whom you sent as our Savior and Redeemer, incarnate by the\n(913.92, 919.2)  Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin. Fulfilling your will and gaining fewer holy people, he\n(919.2, 923.6)  stretched out his hands as he endured his passion so to break the bonds of death and\n(923.6, 928.52)  manifest the resurrection. And so with the angels and all the saints we declare your\n(928.52, 935.52)  glory as with one voice we acclaim. Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts, heaven and\n(935.84, 941.36)  earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he who comes in the name\n(941.36, 945.0)  of the Lord, Hosanna in the highest.\n(945.0, 948.12)  You are indeed holy, O Lord, the fount of all holiness.\n(948.12, 950.72)  Make holy these gifts, we pray, by sending down your Spirit\n(950.72, 953.92)  upon them like the dewfall, that they may become for us\n(953.92, 958.68)  the body and blood of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.\n(958.68, 961.64)  At the time he was betrayed and entered willingly\n(961.64, 964.48)  into his passion, he took bread and, giving thanks,\n(964.48, 967.16)  broke it, gave it to his disciples, saying,\n(967.16, 969.28)  take this, all of you, and eat of it.\n(969.28, 973.1)  But this is my body, which will be given up for you.\n(973.1, 987.9)  In a similar way, when supper was ended, he took the chalice.\n(987.9, 992.38)  Once more giving thanks, he gave it to his disciples, saying, Take this, all of you,\n(992.38, 993.38)  and drink from it.\n(993.38, 998.42)  For this is the chalice of my blood, the blood of the new and eternal covenant, which will\n(998.42, 1015.0)  be put out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Do this in memory of me.\n(1015.0, 1020.62)  The mystery of faith. We proclaim your death, O Lord, and profess your resurrection until\n(1020.62, 1027.46)  you come again. Therefore, as we celebrate the memorial of his death and resurrection,\n(1027.46, 1032.82)  We offer you, Lord, the bread of life and the chalice of salvation, giving thanks that\n(1032.82, 1038.62)  you've held us worthy to be in your presence and minister to you.\n(1038.62, 1045.38)  Humbly we pray that, partaking of the body and blood of Christ, we may be gathered into\n(1045.38, 1048.82)  one by the Holy Spirit.\n(1048.82, 1052.1)  Remember, Lord, your Church spread throughout the world.\n(1052.1, 1057.1)  Bring her to the fullness of charity, together with Leo our Pope, Richard your servant and\n(1057.1, 1059.34)  Bishop, and all the clergy.\n(1059.34, 1062.1)  We pray this morning for the McCarthy and O'Donovan\n(1062.1, 1064.94)  families, oh Lord, whom you've called from this world.\n(1064.94, 1066.98)  Grant that they may be united with your son\n(1066.98, 1069.9)  in a death like his, and they also be one with him\n(1069.9, 1071.62)  in his resurrection.\n(1071.62, 1073.9)  Remember also our brothers and sisters\n(1073.9, 1077.7)  who have fallen asleep in the hope of the resurrection,\n(1077.7, 1080.28)  and all who have died in your mercy.\n(1080.28, 1082.58)  Welcome them into the light of your face.\n(1082.58, 1084.7)  Have mercy on us all, we pray,\n(1084.7, 1087.72)  that with the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God,\n(1087.72, 1090.82)  the blessed apostles, we pray to St. Augustine,\n(1090.82, 1093.82)  St. Bridget, Gate of Heaven, and all the saints\n(1093.82, 1096.1)  who have pleased you throughout the ages,\n(1096.1, 1098.98)  that we may merit to be coheirs to eternal life,\n(1098.98, 1103.98)  and praise and glorify you through your Son, Jesus Christ.\n(1105.02, 1109.32)  Through him, with him, in him, O God, almighty Father,\n(1109.32, 1113.46)  in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\n(1113.46, 1122.46)  All glory and honor is yours, forever and ever. Amen.\n(1124.46, 1128.46)  At the Savior's command, informed by divine teaching, we dare to say,\n(1128.46, 1133.46)  Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.\n(1133.46, 1138.46)  Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.\n(1138.46, 1142.46)  Give us this day our jolly bread, and forgive us our trespasses,\n(1142.46, 1149.46)  as we forgive those who trespass against us and lead us not into temptation, but deliver\n(1149.46, 1155.46)  us from evil. Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil. Graciously grant peace in our\n(1155.46, 1162.46)  days that by the help of your mercy we may be always free from sin, safe from all distress,\n(1162.86, 1168.46)  as we await the blessed hope and the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ. For the Kingdom,\n(1168.46, 1172.28)  and the power and the glory are yours, now and forever.\n(1172.28, 1175.06)  Lord Jesus Christ, who said to your apostles,\n(1175.06, 1178.42)  peace I leave you, my peace I give you.\n(1178.42, 1182.38)  Look not on our sins, but on the faith of your church,\n(1182.38, 1186.84)  and graciously grant her peace and unity\n(1186.84, 1189.36)  in accordance with your will,\n(1189.36, 1192.84)  who live and reign forever and ever.\n(1192.84, 1193.78)  On this beautiful day,\n(1193.78, 1197.28)  may the peace of the Lord be with you always.\n(1197.28, 1204.28)  offer each other a sign of that peace.\n(1208.68, 1212.96)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1212.96, 1217.04)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1217.04, 1224.04)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, grant us peace.\n(1226.96, 1224.04) \n(1230.16, 1232.88)  Behold the Lamb of God, behold him who takes away the sins of the world. How blessed are we who are called to the supper of the Lamb.\n(1232.88, 1238.04)  Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter into my roof, but only say the word and my\n(1238.04, 1239.04)  soul shall be healed.\n(1239.04, 1241.56)  May the body and blood of Christ keep us safe for eternal life.\n(1254.04, 1282.04)  The body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the body of Christ, the

there was this cute little office server that\n(1363.0, 1368.76)  came in to serve, it was a morning Mass, and I said, oh I'd love to have the help, and\n(1368.76, 1370.58)  So it was again heaven.\n(1370.58, 1371.88)  And I said, now what grade are you in?\n(1371.88, 1373.64)  He told me, I'm not gonna tell you what grade he was in.\n(1373.64, 1374.86)  And I said, oh, you must feel good\n(1374.86, 1376.28)  that you've gone to another grade.\n(1376.28, 1378.16)  And so I'm talking to him and I said,\n(1378.16, 1379.84)  I worked in Catholic schools for so many years,\n(1379.84, 1381.36)  I know what questions to ask.\n(1381.36, 1384.24)  I said, are you nervous about next year?\n(1384.24, 1385.24)  Well, yeah.\n(1385.24, 1386.92)  I said, well, what grade are you going in?\n(1386.92, 1387.82)  He told me.\n(1387.82, 1389.36)  I said, do you have a choice of teachers?\n(1389.36, 1391.48)  Do you know what teacher you're gonna get yet?\n(1391.48, 1393.4)  He said, no, not yet.\n(1393.4, 1396.0)  I said, but I bet you're hoping for one of the two\n(1396.0, 1398.32)  that you really wanna get.\n(1398.32, 1399.52)  And he looked at me, how did you know?\n(1399.52, 1401.76)  I said, well, I taught, I know.\n(1401.76, 1404.48)  He said, I said, why do you want that teacher?\n(1404.48, 1406.72)  He said, because she gives out candy.\n(1408.96, 1411.84)  We want to give out knowledge, but we give out candy too.\n(1411.84, 1413.44)  Amen, let us pray.\n(1413.44, 1414.88)  And I think of that because I was,\n(1414.88, 1415.76)  when the prayer of the faithful,\n(1415.76, 1417.92)  I wanted to pray for all our young people,\n(1417.92, 1419.88)  adults and of course college students\n(1419.88, 1423.12)  and our young people on vacation for safety and peace.\n(1423.12, 1424.56)  Let us pray for them today.\n(1428.32, 1429.72)  and for our teachers.\n(1429.72, 1433.34)  May the divine sacrifice we have offered and received\n(1433.34, 1435.44)  fill us with life, O Lord, we pray,\n(1435.44, 1437.98)  so that bound to you in lasting charity,\n(1437.98, 1440.56)  we may bear fruit that lasts forever\n(1440.56, 1442.74)  through Christ our Lord.\n(1442.74, 1443.88)  The Lord be with you.\n(1444.76, 1446.48)  Bow our heads and pray for God's blessing.\n(1446.48, 1447.76)  May the Lord bless you and keep you.\n(1447.76, 1450.2)  May his face shine upon you and be gracious to you.\n(1450.2, 1452.32)  May he bless you this day, going in peace\n(1452.32, 1455.36)  to the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit, amen.\n(1455.36, 1456.4)  Our celebration is ended.\n(1456.4, 1458.36)  Let us go in the peace of Christ.\n(1458.36, 1459.84)  Thanks be to God.\n(1459.84, 1461.0)  Nice being with you in the morning.\n(1461.0, 1461.88)  You're so faithful.\n(1461.88, 1463.76)  Have a great day, have a great summer.\n(1463.76, 1465.12)  Maybe I'll see you again.\n(1465.12, 1466.52)  Go in peace.\n(1468.44, 1470.44)  And thank you for helping me so beautifully.\n(1486.4, 1506.42)  Thank you, and God bless you.\n(1506.42, 1509.42)  See you, Alan.\n(1509.42, 1510.42)  Thanks.\n(1510.42, 1539.78)  Thank you, have a good Fourth of July, God love you, thanks.\n(1539.78, 1540.78)  See you later.\n(1540.78, 1541.78)  God bless you.\n(1541.78, 1542.78)  Good seeing you.\n(1542.78, 1543.78)  Call me honey anytime, tell them.\n(1543.78, 1544.78)

        "transcript": "(209.0, 211.0)  you\n(269.0, 291.68)  Good morning everyone, you can hear me, I'm on, good, good to see you this morning, a\n(291.68, 295.68)  beautiful day again, name of the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit, and may the Lord be with\n(295.68, 296.68)  you.\n(296.68, 300.0)  We offer a Mass today for our parishioners, O Lord.\n(300.0, 303.6)  May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the communion of the Holy\n(303.6, 306.46)  Spirit be with all of you.\n(306.46, 313.04)  As we come to celebrate our liturgy this morning, the readings are about awaking in us the gift\n(313.04, 317.96)  of God's divine grace to heal the storms of life and the fear that we carry.\n(317.96, 322.8)  Let us ask the Lord now to prepare us for this Mass and ask God for forgiveness of our\n(322.8, 323.8)  sins.\n(323.8, 324.8)  Lord, have mercy.\n(324.8, 325.8)  Lord, have mercy.\n(325.8, 334.32)  May almighty God have mercy on us, may the Lord forgive us our sins and bring us to everlasting\n(334.32, 335.32)  light.\n(335.32, 336.32)  Amen.\n(336.32, 337.32)  Let us pray.\n(337.32, 343.04)  O God, who through the grace of adoption chose us to be children of light, grant we pray\n(343.04, 348.08)  that we may not be wrapped in the darkness of error, but always be seen to stand in the\n(348.08, 349.08)  bright light of truth.\n(349.08, 355.28)  To our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives arranged with you in the unity of the Holy\n(355.28, 360.28)  Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever, Amen.\n(360.28, 361.12)  Please be seated.\n(361.12, 363.46)  Let us now be attentive to God's sacred word.\n(375.42, 377.66)  A reading from the book of Genesis.\n(378.74, 383.74)  As dawn was breaking, the angels urged Lot on,\n(383.76, 383.74) \n(390.7, 397.1)  saying on your way take with you your wife and your two daughters who are here or you will be swept away in the punishment of Sodom. When he hesitated\n(397.1, 403.62)  the men by the Lord's mercy seized his hand and the hands of his wife and his\n(403.62, 410.14)  two daughters and led them to safety outside the city. As soon as they had\n(410.14, 417.1)  had been brought outside, he was told flee for your life, don't look back or stop anywhere\n(417.1, 424.1)  on the plain. Get off to the hills at once or you will be swept away. Oh no, my lord,\n(426.1, 432.06)  replied Lot. You have already thought enough of your servant to do me the great kindness\n(432.06, 439.06)  of intervening to save my life. But I cannot flee to the hills to keep the disaster from\n(439.4, 439.06) \n(443.76, 448.26)  from overtaking me, and so I shall die. Look, this town ahead is near enough to escape to.\n(448.26, 450.7)  It's only a small place.\n(450.7, 452.26)  Let me flee there.\n(452.26, 457.7)  It's a small place, is it not, that my life may be saved.\n(457.7, 462.06)  Well then, he replied, I will also grant you the favor,\n(462.06, 463.7)  you now ask.\n(463.7, 466.96)  I will not overthrow the town you speak of.\n(466.96, 474.0)  Hurry, escape there. I cannot do anything until you arrive there.\n(474.0, 478.52)  That is why the town is called Zoar.\"\n(478.52, 483.74)  The sun was just rising over the earth as Lot arrived in Zoar.\n(483.74, 491.96)  At the same time, the Lord rained down sulfurous fire upon Sodom and Gomorrah from the Lord\n(491.96, 494.18)  out of heaven.\n(494.18, 501.26)  He overthrew those cities and the whole plain together with the inhabitants of the cities\n(501.26, 505.38)  and the produce of the soil.\n(505.38, 514.24)  But Lot's wife looked back and she was turned into a pillar of salt.\n(514.24, 520.96)  Early the next morning Abraham went into the place where he had stood in the Lord's presence.\n(520.96, 526.84)  As he looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and the whole region of the plain, he saw\n(526.84, 533.04)  dense smoke over the land rising like fumes from a furnace.\n(533.04, 540.54)  Thus it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, he was mindful of Abraham\n(540.54, 547.52)  by sending Lot away from the upheaval by which God overthrew the cities where Lot had been\n(547.52, 548.52)  living.\n(548.52, 559.92)  The word of the Lord, O Lord, your mercy is before my eyes.\n(559.92, 562.52)  Search me, O Lord, and try me.\n(562.52, 573.4)  Test my soul and my heart, for your mercy is before my eyes, and I walk in your truth.\n(573.4, 580.22)  Gather not my soul with those of sinners, nor with men of blood my life.\n(580.22, 589.04)  On their hands are crimes, and their right hands are full of bribes.\n(589.04, 594.34)  But I walk in integrity, redeem me, and have mercy on me.\n(594.34, 619.46)  My foot stands on level ground, in the assemblies I will bless the Lord.\n(619.46, 621.7)  The Lord be with you.\n(621.7, 626.1)  dating from the Holy Gospel, according to Matthew.\n(626.1, 629.4)  As Jesus got into a boat, his disciples followed him.\n(629.4, 632.44)  Suddenly a violent storm came up on the sea\n(632.44, 635.24)  so that the boat was being swamped by waves,\n(635.24, 636.7)  but he was asleep.\n(636.7, 639.04)  They came and woke him, saying,\n(639.04, 641.48)  Lord Jesus, we're perishing.\n(641.48, 644.52)  He said to them, why are you so terrified?\n(644.52, 646.62)  Oh, you of little faith.\n(646.62, 649.66)  Then he got up, rebuked the winds and the sea,\n(649.66, 651.42)  and there was great calm.\n(651.42, 658.46)  were amazed and said what sort of man is this whom even the winds and the sea obey the gospel\n(658.46, 665.34)  of the lord praise to you lord jesus christ this is a beautiful song even the winds and the waves\n(665.34, 671.82)  obey you oh god but i couldn't find it for this morning but today as we journey forth you're all\n(671.82, 677.66)  for me with the sea in this beautiful community on the ocean so we've seen waves and storms and\n(677.66, 679.48)  and hurricanes and whatever.\n(679.48, 682.16)  I used to love it when it would be so cold\n(682.16, 684.56)  and I'd be going to 468 Beacon Street,\n(684.56, 686.72)  12 years in the education office\n(686.72, 689.66)  and I'd go along Day Boulevard\n(689.66, 692.96)  and the steam would be coming up from the ocean\n(692.96, 696.3)  and it was like a mystery when I first saw it.\n(696.3, 699.18)  So we're surrounded by creation here, which is a gift,\n(699.18, 702.2)  so we can identify with the reading today.\n(702.2, 704.94)  So today as we come, the theme is\n(704.94, 708.3)  even the wind and the rains and the sea obey the Lord.\n(708.3, 710.54)  It's God's divine grace.\n(710.54, 714.14)  He's introducing his disciples, he's training them\n(714.14, 716.48)  for a future that's gonna be very difficult.\n(716.48, 719.5)  It's about trust, we heard that yesterday in the reading.\n(719.5, 722.58)  But today it's trust and to remove the fear.\n(722.58, 725.56)  He rebuked the winds and the sea and it was great calm.\n(725.56, 727.62)  This beautiful narrative seems to suggest\n(727.62, 731.02)  that if we but awaken to the presence of God within us,\n(731.02, 734.1)  if we learn to live and to see at a deeper level,\n(734.1, 738.1)  we will live a basic gift of trust rather than fear.\n(738.1, 740.36)  The meaning today is to focus our heart,\n(740.36, 742.76)  to awaken us to God's presence.\n(742.76, 746.94)  Now the word awaken is very similar to the baptismal rite,\n(746.94, 750.18)  when we baptize a new infant or an adult,\n(750.18, 754.34)  that as the water is placed on their forehead, they shake.\n(754.34, 756.18)  And we pray as priests or deacons\n(756.18, 758.62)  not to get the water in their eyes,\n(758.62, 762.18)  because if you do, they're gonna cry for about 10 minutes.\n(762.18, 765.22)  but the beautiful symbol of water,\n(765.22, 767.62)  awakening them to God's love.\n(767.62, 769.46)  That's what baptism does.\n(769.46, 772.7)  It awakens us to God's love.\n(772.7, 775.98)  And so today, these are all symbols that are happening.\n(775.98, 778.5)  But the theme is, they're beginning not only\n(778.5, 781.7)  to see him as human, but divine.\n(781.7, 785.32)  Now tomorrow, we're gonna hear about Thomas,\n(785.32, 790.32)  doubting Thomas, and the wounds that he would not believe\n(791.28, 790.32) \n(796.12, 805.16)  believe it was Christ until he saw his wounds and the symbol there is trusting but tomorrow the theme is we can't be healed by our wounds unless we show them\n(805.16, 812.08)  to Jesus we have to say these are my wounds my scars help me believe and help\n(812.08, 818.04)  me be healed now we go to the altar the fullness of God's love that heals all\n(818.04, 821.98)  the body and blood of Christ, the Holy Eucharist.\n(821.98, 824.62)  I have three masses today, so I got a great harmony.\n(824.62, 826.58)  I'm going to the Sisters of Saint Joseph.\n(826.58, 829.86)  I won't even eat my notes at 11 o'clock today, amen.\n(829.86, 832.34)  Let us now stand for the prayer of the faithful.\n(832.34, 834.18)  Loving God, as we go before you,\n(834.18, 836.5)  you awaken us to your love every morning\n(836.5, 838.64)  with a gift to the cross and new life.\n(838.64, 841.04)  Pray for us this day, we pray to the Lord.\n(842.06, 843.7)  Let us pray we'll reach out to someone\n(843.7, 846.74)  who hasn't been baptized, one of our family members\n(846.74, 849.24)  gently reminding them that wouldn't it be nice\n(849.24, 851.34)  to have that new baby baptized?\n(851.34, 852.66)  We pray to the Lord.\n(853.66, 855.54)  Let us pray for the divine grace\n(855.54, 858.58)  that the people that we know sometimes are struggling\n(858.58, 862.42)  and may we be that source of light and new water to them\n(862.42, 865.1)  to be guided to the grace of God's divine grace.\n(865.1, 867.16)  We pray to the Lord.\n(867.16, 869.12)  For all those that serve our country and nation,\n(869.12, 872.14)  all the festivities coming up the Fourth of July,\n(872.14, 874.74)  that the Lord will be with us, we pray to the Lord.\n(875.74, 874.74) \n(878.5, 880.42)  And loving God, I've made the Lord bless you this morning, whatever special intention you bring,\n(880.42, 883.26)  not just for yourself, but for one another,\n(883.26, 884.72)  or for another person.\n(884.72, 888.14)  In silence, let us recall what they are in our heart.\n(892.5, 895.5)  Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.\n(895.5, 896.9)  Blessed art thou among women,\n(896.9, 899.02)  and blessed are the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.\n(899.02, 901.54)  Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for our sinners,\n(901.54, 904.02)  now at the hour of our death, amen.\n(904.02, 905.98)  Loving God, bless us as we offer our prayers\n(905.98, 908.78)  to you this day through Christ our Lord.\n(908.78, 909.62)  Amen.\n(964.02, 983.98)  My brothers and sisters, let us pray that the sacrifice may be acceptable to God the\n(983.98, 986.54)  Almighty Father.\n(986.54, 997.9)  O God, who graciously accomps the effects of Your mysteries, grant that we pray that\n(997.9, 1004.22)  the deeds by which we serve You may be worthy of these sacred gifts through Christ our Lord.\n(1004.22, 1005.22)  Amen.\n(1005.22, 1007.9)  My friends, the Lord be with you.\n(1007.9, 1009.7)  Lift up your hearts.\n(1009.7, 1012.46)  Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.\n(1012.46, 1018.82)  It is truly right in just our duty and our salvation, always and everywhere to give you\n(1018.82, 1024.14)  thanks, Father most holy, for your beloved Son, Jesus Christ, your Word through whom\n(1024.14, 1029.4)  you made all things, whom you sent as our Savior and Redeemer, incarnate by the Holy\n(1029.4, 1031.86)  Spirit and born of the Virgin.\n(1031.86, 1036.9)  Fulfilling your will and gaining fewer holy people, he stretched out his hands as he endured\n(1036.9, 1042.0)  his passion, so to break the bonds of death and manifest the resurrection.\n(1042.0, 1047.32)  And so with the angels and all the saints we declare your glory, if with one voice we\n(1047.32, 1048.32)  acclaim.\n(1048.32, 1055.0)  Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts, heaven and earth are full of your glory, Hosanna\n(1055.0, 1056.0)  in the highest.\n(1056.0, 1061.76)  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, Hosanna in the highest.\n(1061.76, 1065.28)  You are indeed holy, O Lord, the fount of all holiness.\n(1065.28, 1069.8)  Make holy these gifts, we pray, by sending down your Spirit upon them like the dewfall,\n(1069.8, 1076.6)  that they may become for us the body and blood of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.\n(1076.6, 1081.52)  At the time He was betrayed and entered willingly into His passion, He took bread and giving\n(1081.52, 1087.16)  thanks, broke it, and gave it to His disciples, saying take this, all of you, and eat of it.\n(1087.16, 1091.04)  For this is My body, which will be given up for you.\n(1099.8, 1109.32)  In a similar way, when supper was ended, He took the chalice, and once more, giving thanks,\n(1109.32, 1114.24)  He gave it to His disciples, saying, Take this, all of you, and drink from it, for this\n(1114.24, 1119.58)  is the chalice of My blood, the blood of the new and eternal covenant, which will be put\n(1119.58, 1126.0)  out for you and for many, for the forgiveness of sins.\n(1126.0, 1127.76)  Do this in memory of Me.\n(1129.8, 1141.52)  The mystery of faith, we proclaim your death, O Lord, and profess your resurrection until\n(1141.52, 1145.16)  you come again.\n(1145.16, 1148.8)  Therefore we celebrate the memorial of his death and resurrection.\n(1148.8, 1153.98)  We offer you, Lord, the bread of life and the chalice of salvation, giving thanks that\n(1153.98, 1159.04)  you have held us worthy to be in your presence and minister to you.\n(1159.04, 1165.6)  Fumbly we pray that partaking of the Body and Blood of Christ we may be gathered into\n(1165.6, 1169.2)  one by the Holy Spirit.\n(1169.2, 1172.32)  Remember Lord your Church spread throughout the world.\n(1172.32, 1178.8)  Bring her to the fullness of charity together with your servant, Pope Leo, our Bishop Richard\n(1178.8, 1180.04)  and all the clergy.\n(1180.04, 1185.86)  Oh Lord, remember your servants and all those we pray for our parishioners this day.\n(1185.86, 1192.28)  also our brothers and sisters who have fallen asleep in the hope of the resurrection, and\n(1192.28, 1198.56)  all who have died in Your mercy, welcome them into the light of Your face.\n(1198.56, 1203.96)  Have mercy on us all, we pray, with the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God, Joseph, her chaste\n(1203.96, 1210.4)  spouse, with all the apostles, St. Augustine, parish, St. Brigid, gate of heaven, and all\n(1210.4, 1215.18)  Your saints, O Lord, who have pleased You throughout the ages, that we may merit to\n(1215.18, 1224.46)  be coheirs to eternal life and praise and glorify you through your Son, Jesus Christ.\n(1224.46, 1233.46)  Through him, with him, in him, O God, almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, all\n(1233.46, 1243.26)  glory and honor is yours forever and ever, Amen.\n(1243.26, 1249.86)  As we stand together at the Savior's command, informed by divine teaching, we dare to say\n(1249.86, 1253.86)  Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.\n(1253.86, 1258.86)  Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.\n(1258.86, 1265.46)  Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who\n(1265.46, 1271.46)  trespass against us, and lead us not in temptation, but deliver us from evil.\n(1271.46, 1274.74)  Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil.\n(1274.74, 1280.7)  Graciously grant peace in our days, that by the help of your mercy we may be always free\n(1280.7, 1288.14)  from sin, safe from all distress, as we await the blessed hope and the coming of our Savior,\n(1288.14, 1289.14)  Jesus Christ.\n(1289.14, 1294.46)  For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours, now and forever.\n(1294.46, 1300.82)  Lord Jesus, who said to your apostles, Peace I leave you, my peace I give you, look not\n(1300.82, 1304.66)  not on our sins, but on the faith of your church,\n(1304.66, 1308.08)  and graciously grant her peace and unity\n(1309.26, 1311.66)  in accordance with your will,\n(1311.66, 1314.86)  who live and reign forever and ever.\n(1314.86, 1316.58)  This beautiful day, may the peace of the Lord\n(1316.58, 1318.38)  be with you always.\n(1318.38, 1321.72)  Let us offer each other a sign of peace.\n(1330.82, 1337.82)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1337.82, 1341.82)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.\n(1341.82, 1349.82)  Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world, grant us peace.\n(1349.82, 1352.82)  Behold the Lamb of God, behold him who takes away the sins of the world.\n(1352.82, 1355.82)  How blessed are we who are called to the supper of the Lamb.\n(1355.82, 1361.42)  Lord, I am not worthy you should enter into my roof, but only say the word and my soul shall be healed.\n(1361.42, 1364.38)  If the body and blood of Christ keep us safe for eternal life.\n(1385.82, 1386.82)  I don't know what to say, but I'm not sure what to say, but I'm not sure what to say.\n(1386.82, 1387.82)  I don't know what to say, but I'm not sure what to say.\n(1387.82, 1388.82)  I don't know what to say, but I'm not sure what to say.\n(1388.82,

not sure what to say.\n(1391.82, 1392.82)  I don't know what to say, but I'm not sure what to say.\n(1392.82, 1393.82)  I don't know what to say, but I'm not sure what to say.\n(1393.82, 1394.82)  I don't know what to say, but I'm not sure what to say.\n(1394.82, 1395.82)  I don't know what to say, but I'm not sure what to say.\n(1395.82, 1396.82)  I don't know what to say, but I'm not sure what to say.\n(1396.82, 1397.82)  I don't know what to say, but I don't know what to say.\n(1397.82, 1398.82)  I don't know what to say, but I don't know what to say.\n(1398.82, 1399.82)  I don't know what to say, but I don't know what to say.\n(1399.82, 1400.82)  I don't know what to say, but I don't know what to say.\n(1400.82, 1401.82)  I don't know what to say, but I don't know what to say.\n(1401.82, 1402.82)  I don't know what to say, but I don't know what to say.\n(1402.82, 1403.82)  I don't know what to say, but I don't know what to say.\n(1403.82, 1404.82)  I don't know what to say, but I don't know what to say.\n(1404.82, 1405.82)  I don't know what to say, but I don't know what to say.\n(1405.82, 1406.82)  I don't know what to say, but I don't know what to say.\n(1406.82,

salvation is close at hand, moving from night into day.\n(1434.82, 1441.82)  Lift up your voices and pray.\n(1441.82, 1448.3)  Come, Lord, for all our love.\n(1448.3, 1454.78)  Come and bring us your peace.\n(1454.78, 1461.26)  Come, Lord, for all our love.\n(1461.26, 1471.74)  Come to us, set us free, come, Lord, and bring us your peace.\n(1479.22, 1471.74) \n(1485.7, 1498.7)  of the days of the dark.
